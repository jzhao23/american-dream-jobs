# Documentation Habits
All changes, especially those involving pulling from external databases or implementing logic on top of external data, require extensive documentation in .md (Markdown). Document the data source and how it is being used and transformed.

# Testing Habits
Ensure that all changes large or small are properly tested and validated with test cases. Test rigorously and comprehensively. Bias towards testing more rather than less.

# Git habits
DO NOT SWITCH BRANCHES WHILE DOING LONG TASKS. STAY ON THE BRANCH THE SESSION IS INITIATED IN AT ALL COSTS DURING ALL TIMES WITHOUT EXCEPTION. NEVER GIT CHECKOUT MAIN IF YOU ARE NOT ALREADY IN THE MAIN BRANCH (WHICH YOU SHOULD VERIFY BEFORE DOING ANY GIT CHECKOUTS)
