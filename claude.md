# Overview
This is a project that allows Americans to explore jobs and plan their careers.

# Documentation Habits
All changes, especially those involving pulling from external databases or implementing logic on top of external data, require extensive documentation in .md (Markdown). Document the data source and how it is being used and transformed.

# Testing Habits
Ensure that all changes large or small are properly tested and validated with test cases. Test rigorously and comprehensively. Bias towards testing more rather than less.
