The political science professor teaches and researches politics—educating students in American politics, international relations, comparative politics, and political theory while producing scholarship that advances understanding of political systems and behavior. A typical week during the academic term blends teaching with research and service. Perhaps 35% of time goes to teaching: preparing lectures and seminars, conducting discussions, meeting with students. Another 40% involves research—analyzing data, developing theory, writing papers. The remaining time splits between grading, committee work, advising, and professional activities.

People who thrive as political science professors combine analytical ability with deep interest in political life and the methodological skills that contemporary political science requires. Successful professors develop research specializations while building the pedagogical skills that political education demands. They must maintain scholarly objectivity while teaching about issues that students care passionately about. Those who struggle often cannot separate personal political views from scholarly analysis or find the quantitative demands of the field overwhelming. Others fail because they cannot produce publications at rates competitive departments require.

Political science education provides understanding of political systems that democratic citizenship requires while advancing knowledge of governance, conflict, and political behavior. The field influences policy debates and produces graduates who work in government, law, and public affairs. Political science professors appear in discussions of civic education, political research, and the academic institutions that train political scientists.

Practitioners cite the importance of political understanding for democracy and the intellectual engagement of political analysis as primary rewards. The research addresses questions fundamental to governance. The teaching shapes future citizens and leaders. The policy relevance provides meaning. The methodological diversity offers analytical options. The questions are genuinely consequential. Common frustrations include the politicization of political science in public debates and the competitive academic job market. Many find that research findings are weaponized in political debates. Maintaining objectivity about current politics is challenging. The field's internal methodological debates are contentious. Teaching politically charged topics requires careful navigation.

This career requires a doctoral degree in political science, with research productivity essential. Strong analytical, teaching, and methodological skills are required. The role suits those passionate about political questions who can maintain scholarly objectivity. It is poorly suited to those preferring political activism, uncomfortable with methodology debates, or seeking work outside academia. Compensation is moderate, with the academic job market competitive.
