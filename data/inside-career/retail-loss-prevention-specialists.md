The loss prevention specialist protects retailers from theft—conducting surveillance, apprehending shoplifters, investigating internal theft, and implementing strategies to reduce shrink in retail environments. A typical shift blends surveillance with investigation. Perhaps 50% of time goes to floor surveillance: watching for theft, monitoring cameras, deterring would-be shoplifters. Another 30% involves apprehension and processing—detaining suspects, completing reports, coordinating with police. The remaining time addresses investigation of internal theft, training, and loss analysis.

People who thrive in loss prevention combine observation skills with confrontation capability and the judgment that distinguishing actual theft requires. Successful specialists develop expertise in detecting theft behaviors while building the legal knowledge that proper apprehension demands. They must act within legal limits while making quick decisions. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical confrontations that apprehension involves or find the hours of surveillance tedious. Others fail because they make false accusations or use excessive force.
