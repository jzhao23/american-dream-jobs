The film and video editor shapes raw footage into finished stories—selecting shots, determining pacing, assembling sequences, and refining visual narratives across film, television, documentary, and digital content. A typical week during post-production involves intensive creative work. Perhaps 70% of time goes to editing: reviewing footage, making cuts, refining sequences, polishing edits. Another 15% involves collaboration—reviewing with directors, incorporating feedback, coordinating with sound and visual effects. The remaining time addresses technical processes, project organization, and the media management that complex projects require.

People who thrive as editors combine storytelling instinct with technical proficiency and the patience that iterative refinement requires. Successful editors develop keen sense of rhythm and pacing while building mastery of editing software and the ability to maintain objectivity about footage after repeated viewing. They must serve directors' visions while bringing their own narrative judgment. Those who struggle often cannot maintain perspective after viewing the same footage repeatedly or find the isolation of editing bays challenging. Others fail because they cannot receive feedback on work they've invested significant effort in without defensiveness.

Film and video editing shapes how visual stories unfold, with editors making countless decisions that determine what audiences experience. The field combines creative judgment with technical craft.
