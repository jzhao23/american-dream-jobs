The school bus monitor ensures student safety during transport—supervising children on school buses, managing behavior, assisting with boarding and unloading, and supporting the driver in maintaining safe transportation. A typical day involves morning and afternoon routes. Perhaps 70% of time goes to student supervision: monitoring behavior, ensuring seat belt use, maintaining order. Another 15% involves assistance—helping students board and exit, securing wheelchair passengers, assisting with special needs. The remaining time addresses communication with drivers and schools, and documentation of incidents.

People who thrive as school bus monitors combine patience with child management skills and the firmness that maintaining order requires. Successful monitors develop ability to manage diverse student populations while building the calm that handling behavioral issues demands. They must maintain authority without creating conflict. Those who struggle often cannot control student behavior or find the noise and chaos of buses overwhelming. Others fail because they cannot handle the split shift schedule.

School bus monitoring ensures that student transportation is safe and orderly, with monitors providing the additional supervision that enables drivers to focus on road safety. The field serves schools with populations requiring extra oversight. School bus monitors appear in discussions of student transportation, school safety, and the personnel supporting school buses.
