The agricultural grader inspects and sorts farm products—examining produce for quality, separating items by grade, removing damaged goods, and ensuring that agricultural products meet standards before reaching consumers. A typical day centers on sorting activity. Perhaps 85% of time goes to grading and sorting: examining products, making quality determinations, separating grades, removing defects. Another 10% involves equipment operation—running sorting machines, maintaining lines. The remaining time addresses documentation and coordination.

People who thrive as agricultural graders combine quick assessment ability with consistency and the visual acuity that rapid quality evaluation requires. Successful graders develop expertise in their specific products while building the speed that production line pace demands. They must maintain accuracy while maintaining speed. Those who struggle often cannot sustain the rapid pace of sorting lines or find the extreme repetition unbearable. Others fail because they cannot maintain the consistency that reliable grading requires.

Agricultural grading serves as the quality control function for farm products, with graders ensuring that what reaches markets meets standards. The field concentrates in packing houses, processing facilities, and agricultural distribution.
