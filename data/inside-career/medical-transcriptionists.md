The medical transcriptionist converts physician dictation into written medical records—listening to recordings and producing the documents that comprise patient health histories. A typical day centers on transcription production. Perhaps 80% of time goes to transcription: listening to dictation, typing documents, editing for accuracy. Another 15% involves quality review—proofreading, researching unfamiliar terms, ensuring consistency. The remaining time addresses administrative tasks and maintaining skills with medical terminology.

People who thrive as medical transcriptionists combine exceptional listening skills with typing speed and the medical knowledge that accurate transcription requires. Successful transcriptionists develop deep medical vocabulary while building the concentration that prolonged focused work demands. They must maintain accuracy despite production quotas. Those who struggle often cannot understand heavily accented dictation or find the isolated work challenging. Others fail because they cannot maintain typing speed and accuracy under production pressure.
