The sales supervisor outside retail manages sales teams—directing account representatives, setting targets, coaching performance, and ensuring that sales teams meet revenue goals in wholesale, business-to-business, or service sales environments. A typical day blends team management with sales involvement. Perhaps 45% of time goes to team oversight: reviewing pipelines, coaching representatives, addressing account issues, facilitating deals. Another 35% involves strategic work—setting goals, planning territories, reporting to leadership, recruiting. The remaining time addresses personal sales involvement, customer relationship management, and cross-functional coordination.

People who thrive as sales supervisors combine personal sales ability with leadership skills and the strategic thinking that optimizing team performance requires. Successful supervisors develop expertise in their industry's sales process while building the coaching abilities that improve representative performance. They must balance pushing for results with supporting their team. Those who struggle often cannot make the transition from individual contributor to manager or find the accountability for others' numbers frustrating. Others fail because they cannot handle the pressure of missed targets.

Non-retail sales supervision spans industries from technology to manufacturing to financial services, with supervisors leading the teams that drive business revenue. The field offers significant earnings potential tied to team performance. Sales supervisors appear in discussions of sales management, revenue leadership, and the managers who build and direct revenue-generating teams.

Compensation includes base plus commission on team performance, potentially substantial.
