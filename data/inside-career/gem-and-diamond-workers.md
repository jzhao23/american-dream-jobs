The gem and diamond worker shapes and evaluates precious stones—cutting facets, polishing surfaces, and grading quality for jewelry and industrial applications. A typical day involves precision work under magnification. Perhaps 50% of time goes to cutting and polishing—shaping stones to maximize brilliance while minimizing waste. Another 30% involves evaluation: examining stones for clarity, color, and flaws that affect value. The remaining time splits between client consultation, documentation, and equipment maintenance.

People who thrive as gem workers combine exceptional manual dexterity with aesthetic judgment and genuine appreciation for the beauty and value of precious stones. Successful workers develop expertise in stone characteristics while achieving the precision that maximizes value. They understand how cuts affect light behavior and appearance. Those who struggle often cannot achieve the precision that valuable stones demand or lack the patience for work measured in millimeters. Others fail because they cannot tolerate the eye strain that constant magnified work produces.

Gem cutting represents one of the oldest precision crafts, transforming rough stones into brilliant gems. The trade has concentrated in specific global centers—Antwerp for diamonds, Jaipur for colored stones—though workers exist wherever jewelry is made. The work appears in discussions of luxury goods and skilled craftsmanship. Technology has changed some aspects, but hand skills remain essential.

Practitioners cite the beauty of the materials and the satisfaction of revealing a stone's potential as primary rewards. Working with precious materials provides unique engagement. The precision craft offers artistic satisfaction. The expertise is rare and valued. Successful stones command premium prices. Common frustrations include the eye strain and physical demands of precision work and the pressure when working with valuable materials where mistakes are costly. Market fluctuations affect demand unpredictably. Competition from technology threatens some positions.

This career requires training in gem cutting and evaluation, developed through apprenticeship or specialized programs. Gemological certifications demonstrate expertise. The role suits those with exceptional fine motor skills and appreciation for precious materials. It is poorly suited to those with vision limitations, lacking patience for precision work, or uncomfortable with valuable materials. Compensation varies dramatically, from modest for production workers to substantial for expert cutters and evaluators.
