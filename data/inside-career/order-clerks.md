The order clerk processes customer orders—receiving orders by phone, mail, or electronic systems, entering information, tracking shipments, and handling the transactions that fulfill customer requests. A typical day centers on order processing. Perhaps 70% of time goes to order handling: entering orders, verifying information, checking inventory, processing transactions. Another 20% involves customer communication—answering inquiries, providing status updates, resolving problems. The remaining time addresses system maintenance, reporting, and coordination with fulfillment.

People who thrive as order clerks combine accuracy with customer service ability and the efficiency that high-volume transaction processing requires. Successful clerks develop expertise in ordering systems while building the communication skills that handling customer questions demands. They must maintain accuracy while maintaining pace. Those who struggle often cannot handle the repetitive data entry or find the customer complaints draining. Others fail because they cannot maintain the accuracy that order fulfillment requires.

Order clerking serves as the transaction processing function that connects customer requests to fulfillment, with clerks handling the data entry and communication that enables commerce. The field faces significant automation as e-commerce and automated ordering systems reduce human processing. Order clerks appear in discussions of sales support, customer service operations, and the administrative workforce enabling order fulfillment.
