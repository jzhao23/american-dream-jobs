The stocker maintains inventory and fills orders—stocking shelves, picking items, and providing the product availability that retail and distribution depend on. A typical day centers on stocking and order work. Perhaps 70% of time goes to stocking and picking: placing products on shelves, locating items, filling orders, organizing inventory. Another 20% involves customer and operational support—answering questions, pricing items, operating equipment. The remaining time addresses record keeping and receiving.

People who thrive as stockers combine physical capability with organization and the customer service that retail environments require. Successful stockers develop efficiency with their product areas while building the accuracy that order filling demands. They must locate products quickly and maintain organized displays. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical demands or find the pace challenging. Others fail because they cannot develop the product knowledge that efficient stocking requires.

Stocking and order filling represents essential retail and warehouse operations, with workers maintaining the inventory that customers purchase and orders require. The field serves retail stores, warehouses, and distribution centers. Stockers appear in discussions of retail employment, warehouse work, and the workers who maintain product availability.
