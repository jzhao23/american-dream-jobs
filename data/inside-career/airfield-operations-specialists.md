Successful specialists develop expertise with airfield systems while building the coordination abilities that complex operations demand. They must maintain safe conditions while numerous activities occur simultaneously. Those who struggle often cannot handle the regulatory complexity or find the responsibility stressful. Others fail because they cannot maintain the situational awareness that dynamic airfield environments require.
