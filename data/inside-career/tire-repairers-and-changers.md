Another 10% involves customer interaction—explaining needs, discussing options. The remaining time addresses inventory and shop maintenance.

People who thrive as tire technicians combine mechanical skill with efficiency and the customer service ability that automotive retail requires. Successful technicians develop speed in tire service while building the safety awareness that correct mounting demands. They must work efficiently while ensuring safety. Those who struggle often cannot maintain the pace that productivity requires or find the repetitive nature tedious. Others fail because they cannot achieve the quality that wheel balance and mounting require.
