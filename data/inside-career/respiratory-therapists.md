The respiratory therapist treats patients with breathing problems—managing ventilators in ICUs, providing treatments for asthma and COPD, and supporting patients through respiratory crises. A typical day involves administering breathing treatments, managing mechanical ventilation, conducting diagnostic testing, and responding to respiratory emergencies. Perhaps 60% of time goes to direct patient care—treatments, assessments, and ventilator management. Another 20% involves documentation and diagnostic testing: arterial blood gases, pulmonary function tests, and recording patient progress. The remaining time splits between equipment maintenance, patient education, and emergency response. The work operates at the intersection of routine treatment and critical care.

People who thrive in respiratory therapy combine technical competence with critical care composure and genuine enjoyment of direct patient care. Successful therapists develop expertise in ventilator management while remaining responsive to the variety of respiratory conditions. They handle the stress of ICU environments where patient conditions change rapidly. Those who struggle often cannot manage the intensity of critical care or find the repetitive nature of routine treatments tedious. Others fail because they cannot maintain focus during long shifts with critically ill patients. The work provides direct impact but demands resilience.

Respiratory therapy has evolved alongside mechanical ventilation technology. The pandemic elevated awareness of respiratory therapists' critical role. The profession appears in healthcare settings, particularly ICUs, where therapists manage life-sustaining equipment.

Practitioners cite the satisfaction of helping patients breathe and the critical care environment as primary rewards. The demand for RTs provides job security. The variety of settings offers options. The work has immediate, visible impact. Common frustrations include the physical demands of long shifts and the emotional toll of patient deaths, particularly prevalent during the pandemic. Many resent being undervalued relative to nurses despite comparable education. Shift work disrupts life.

This career requires an associate or bachelor's degree in respiratory therapy plus national certification (RRT credential). Bachelor's degrees are increasingly preferred. State licensure is required. The role suits those who enjoy critical care and can handle high-acuity patients. It is poorly suited to those who find medical emergencies overwhelming, struggle with shift work, or prefer more autonomous practice. Compensation is solid, with hospital and critical care settings offering the best pay.
