The livestock farmworker cares for animals on farms and ranches—feeding, watering, cleaning, moving, and maintaining the animals that agriculture produces. A typical day centers on animal care. Perhaps 80% of time goes to direct animal work: feeding, watering, cleaning facilities, moving animals, monitoring health. Another 15% involves facility maintenance—repairing fences, cleaning equipment, maintaining structures. The remaining time addresses documentation, coordination, and emergency animal care.

People who thrive as livestock workers combine physical capability with genuine care for animals and the reliability that animal welfare demands. Successful workers develop animal handling skills while building the observation abilities that detecting health problems requires. They must be present daily—animals don't take days off. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical demands or find the consistency of routine tedious. Others fail because they cannot develop the stockmanship that safe, effective animal handling requires.

Livestock farmwork represents the essential labor of animal agriculture, with workers providing the daily care that farm and ranch animals require. The field spans cattle ranches to poultry operations to aquaculture facilities. Farmworkers appear in discussions of animal agriculture, rural labor, and the workers who care for America's livestock.

Living in rural areas limits other opportunities. The conditions can be harsh. The emotional attachment to animals makes losses painful.

This career requires physical capability with animal handling training. Strong work ethic, reliability, and animal care ability are essential.

Compensation is low, often with housing included.
