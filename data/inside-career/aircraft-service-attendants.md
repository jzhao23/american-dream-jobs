The aircraft service attendant supports aircraft operations—servicing planes between flights with the fuel, supplies, and ground support that turnarounds require. A typical shift centers on aircraft servicing. Perhaps 70% of time goes to direct service: fueling aircraft, loading supplies, operating ground equipment, servicing lavatories. Another 20% involves equipment operation—driving tugs, positioning jetways, operating service vehicles. The remaining time addresses safety checks and coordination with flight crews.

People who thrive as aircraft service attendants combine physical capability with safety consciousness and the urgency that flight schedules demand. Successful attendants develop proficiency with various ground equipment while building the awareness that ramp safety requires. They must complete services quickly while avoiding hazards around aircraft. Those who struggle often cannot handle the outdoor conditions on airport ramps or find the physical demands exhausting. Others fail because they cannot maintain safety vigilance amid time pressure.
