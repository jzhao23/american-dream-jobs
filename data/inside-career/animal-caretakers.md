The animal caretaker provides daily care for animals—feeding, cleaning, exercising, and monitoring the animals in kennels, shelters, zoos, or veterinary facilities. A typical shift centers on basic care. Perhaps 65% of time goes to daily care: feeding, watering, cleaning enclosures. Another 25% involves exercise and monitoring—walking animals, observing for health issues, providing enrichment. The remaining time addresses record keeping, facility maintenance, and interaction with owners or visitors.

People who thrive as animal caretakers combine genuine love of animals with physical stamina and the reliability that dependent animals require. Successful caretakers develop competence in animal handling while building the observation skills that recognizing health or behavior changes demands. They must show up consistently since animals depend on care. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical demands of cleaning or find animal illness emotionally overwhelming. Others fail because they cannot maintain boundaries between caring and inappropriate attachment.

Animal caretaking provides the daily care that keeps animals healthy and comfortable, with caretakers serving as the consistent presence meeting animals' basic needs.

Compensation is low, often near minimum wage.
