The infantry soldier closes with enemies—performing the ground combat that controls terrain and defeats adversaries through close combat. A typical duty period centers on training and readiness. Perhaps 55% of time involves tactical training: patrolling, marksmanship, battle drills, field exercises. Another 30% addresses physical training and equipment maintenance. The remaining time covers administrative duties and garrison activities.

People who thrive as infantry soldiers combine physical toughness with tactical skill and the aggression that close combat demands. Successful soldiers develop proficiency with infantry weapons and tactics while building the endurance that ground combat requires. They must perform under extreme physical and psychological stress. Those who struggle often cannot meet the physical demands or find the combat exposure traumatic. Others fail because they cannot develop the warrior mindset that infantry effectiveness requires.

Infantry service represents the core of ground combat, with enlisted soldiers performing the close combat that ultimately controls terrain. The field serves Army and Marine Corps infantry units. Infantry soldiers appear in discussions of combat arms, military ground forces, and the soldiers who directly engage enemies.

Practitioners cite the bonds and the purpose as primary rewards. The bonds formed in infantry units are among the strongest possible. The mission is clear and important. Physical fitness becomes a way of life. Combat arms respect exists. The experiences are intense and memorable. The warrior identity is meaningful to many. Common frustrations include the toll and the sacrifice. Many find that combat exposure leaves lasting effects. The physical demands break down bodies over time. Time away from family is extensive. Peacetime garrison duty is tedious after combat. Transition to civilian life can be difficult.

This career requires Army or Marine Corps enlistment and infantry training. Strong physical capability, mental toughness, and tactical aptitude are essential. The role suits those called to ground combat service. It is poorly suited to those uncomfortable with violence, unable to meet physical demands, or seeking stable family life. Compensation includes enlisted pay and combat arms bonuses.
