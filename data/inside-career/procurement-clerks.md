The procurement clerk supports purchasing operations—processing purchase orders, maintaining vendor records, tracking deliveries, and handling the documentation that acquiring goods and services requires. A typical day centers on purchasing support. Perhaps 60% of time goes to order processing: entering requisitions, creating purchase orders, tracking orders, confirming receipts. Another 25% involves vendor coordination—communicating with suppliers, resolving discrepancies, updating vendor information. The remaining time addresses reporting, filing, and administrative support.

Others fail because they cannot communicate effectively with vendors or resolve order problems.
