The community health worker bridges healthcare systems and communities—connecting underserved populations to health services, promoting healthy behaviors, and advocating for community members who face barriers accessing care. A typical week blends outreach with education and support. Perhaps 40% of time goes to community contact: visiting homes, conducting screenings, meeting with community members. Another 35% involves education and referral—distributing health information, connecting people to services, following up on care. The remaining time splits between documentation, attending community events, training, and coordinating with healthcare providers.

People who thrive as community health workers combine deep community knowledge with health literacy and the relationship skills that earning trust requires. Successful workers develop expertise in health topics relevant to their communities while building the cultural competence that effective health promotion demands. They must navigate between healthcare systems and communities that may distrust those systems. Those who struggle often cannot establish trust with community members who have been failed by healthcare before or find the systemic barriers to care frustrating. Others fail because they cannot maintain professional boundaries while working in their own communities.

Community health work addresses health disparities by providing trusted liaisons who understand community needs and can navigate healthcare systems on behalf of community members. The field has grown with recognition that addressing health equity requires community-based approaches. Community health workers appear in discussions of health disparities, community engagement, and the community-based workforce that extends healthcare's reach.
