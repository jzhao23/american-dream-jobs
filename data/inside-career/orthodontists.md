The orthodontist straightens teeth and corrects jaw alignment—using braces, aligners, and other appliances to improve both function and appearance over treatment periods that typically span years. A typical day involves patient appointments in a continuous flow, with procedures that are often brief but require precision. Perhaps 70% of time goes to direct patient care—placing brackets, adjusting wires, checking progress, and fitting aligners. Another 15% involves treatment planning: analyzing diagnostic records, creating custom treatment plans, and monitoring long-term progress. The remaining time splits between practice management, staff supervision, and consultations with referring dentists.

People who thrive as orthodontists combine spatial reasoning with patience and genuine enjoyment of the long-term patient relationships orthodontic treatment creates. Successful orthodontists develop expertise in treatment mechanics while building practices that attract steady patient flow. They explain treatment clearly to patients and parents, managing expectations for lengthy processes. Those who struggle often find the repetitive nature of adjustments tedious or cannot maintain the patient volume orthodontic economics require. Others fail because they cannot effectively communicate with adolescent patients and their parents. The work is more routine than some dental specialties.

Orthodontics has transformed from metal braces to include clear aligners that have democratized treatment while commoditizing some services. The specialty maintains strong earning potential though direct-to-consumer aligners have disrupted traditional practice models. Orthodontists appear in discussions of cosmetic dentistry and adolescent dental care. The specialty's visibility has increased as more adults seek treatment.

Practitioners cite the satisfaction of creating beautiful smiles and the positive patient relationships as primary rewards. The work is predictable with minimal emergencies. The lifestyle is excellent compared to other dental specialties. Seeing dramatic transformations over treatment courses provides visual satisfaction. The compensation is strong. Common frustrations include the challenge direct-to-consumer aligners pose to traditional practice models and the high overhead costs of orthodontic practice. Many find the repetitive nature of adjustments monotonous. Managing non-compliant patients who don't wear their appliances is frustrating.

This career requires a dental degree (DDS/DMD) followed by a two- to three-year orthodontic residency. Board certification, while not required, signals expertise. Residency positions are competitive. The role suits those who enjoy precision work and long-term patient relationships. It is poorly suited to those who need procedural variety, prefer acute over chronic treatment, or find working with adolescents challenging. Compensation is excellent, though establishing a practice requires significant investment.
