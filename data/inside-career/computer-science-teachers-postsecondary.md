The computer science professor teaches and researches computing—educating students in programming, algorithms, systems, and theory while producing scholarship that advances the field and sometimes creates the technologies that transform society. A typical week during the academic term blends teaching with research and service. Perhaps 30% of time goes to teaching: preparing lectures, conducting classes, supervising labs. Another 45% involves research—writing code, conducting experiments, preparing papers, advising graduate students. The remaining time splits between grading, committee work, grant writing, and professional activities.

People who thrive as computer science professors combine deep technical expertise with teaching ability and the entrepreneurial mindset that successful research programs require. Successful professors develop research specializations while building the pedagogical skills that computer science education demands. They must maintain current technical knowledge in a rapidly evolving field and compete for research funding. Those who struggle often cannot produce research at the pace top programs require or find teaching introductory programming tedious. Others fail because they cannot manage research groups and graduate students effectively.

Computer science education prepares students for technology careers while advancing the field through research that sometimes directly creates new technologies and systems. The field has grown dramatically with computing's importance, creating strong demand for computer science professors amid competition from industry. Computer science professors appear in discussions of computing education, technology research, and the academic pipeline that trains the technology workforce.

Practitioners cite the intellectual excitement of computing research and the ability to work on technology that changes the world as primary rewards. The cutting-edge research is genuinely exciting. The students are often highly motivated. The field's importance is widely recognized. The compensation competes favorably with other academic fields. The sabbaticals and flexibility are valued. Common frustrations include the competition with industry for talent that makes recruitment difficult and the pressure to secure external research funding. Many find that teaching loads limit research time. Keeping current with rapidly evolving technology is demanding. Industry salaries create ongoing temptation. Graduate student advising is time-intensive.

This career requires a doctoral degree in computer science or related field, with strong research productivity essential. Strong technical, teaching, and grant-writing skills are required. The role suits those committed to advancing computing who can manage research programs. It is poorly suited to those preferring industry practice, uncomfortable with academic pressure, or seeking purely teaching-focused positions. Compensation is good relative to other academic fields, though typically below industry alternatives for similar skills.
