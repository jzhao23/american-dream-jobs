The tactical operations supervisor leads specialized enlisted personnel—directing the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who perform operational functions beyond standard categories. A typical duty period combines operations and supervision. Perhaps 50% of time involves specialty operations: conducting training, performing duties, maintaining proficiency. Another 35% addresses supervision—developing personnel, managing assignments, evaluating performance. The remaining time covers administrative requirements and coordination.

People who thrive as tactical supervisors combine specialty expertise with leadership ability and the mentoring that enlisted development requires. Successful supervisors develop mastery in their specialties while building the authority that first-line supervision demands. They must maintain operational readiness while developing junior members. Those who struggle often cannot balance technical duties with leadership responsibilities or find personnel management challenging. Others fail because they cannot develop the flexibility that varied supervision requires.
