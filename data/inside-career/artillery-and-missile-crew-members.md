The artillery crew member operates fire support weapons—serving on gun and missile crews that deliver the indirect fires ground forces depend on. A typical duty period combines training and operations. Perhaps 55% of time involves crew operations: gunnery training, fire missions, operating assigned systems. Another 30% addresses maintenance—servicing weapons, maintaining equipment, preparing ammunition. The remaining time covers training and administrative duties.

People who thrive as artillery crew members combine technical precision with teamwork and the discipline that accurate fires require. Successful crew members develop proficiency with their assigned duties while building the crew coordination that effective gunnery demands. They must perform precisely under pressure to deliver accurate fires. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical demands of ammunition handling or find the noise and concussion difficult. Others fail because they cannot develop the precision that fire missions require.

Artillery crew work represents fire support operations, with enlisted members manning the weapons that deliver indirect fires. The field serves Army and Marine Corps artillery and missile units. Crew members appear in discussions of combat arms, enlisted fire support, and the soldiers who crew artillery pieces and missile systems.

Practitioners cite the firepower and the teamwork as primary rewards. The firepower of artillery is impressive. Crew coordination is satisfying when achieved. The contribution to ground forces is meaningful. The technical aspects are engaging. Combat arms respect exists. Career progression is possible. Common frustrations include the demands and the conditions. Many find that ammunition handling is physically exhausting. The noise causes hearing damage despite protection. Field exercises are demanding. Peacetime training differs significantly from combat. The liability for errant rounds is shared.

This career requires Army or Marine Corps enlistment and artillery training. Strong physical capability, precision, and teamwork are essential. The role suits those attracted to fire support in enlisted roles. It is poorly suited to those uncomfortable with heavy lifting, sensitive to noise, or wanting individual assignments. Compensation includes enlisted pay and combat arms benefits.
