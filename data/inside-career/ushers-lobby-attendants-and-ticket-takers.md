The usher and ticket taker assists patrons at entertainment venues—collecting tickets, directing to seats, providing information, and maintaining order at theaters, stadiums, and arenas. A typical event shift centers on patron assistance. Perhaps 60% of time goes to patron service: checking tickets, directing seating, answering questions. Another 25% involves venue operations—monitoring sections, addressing problems, maintaining order. The remaining time addresses pre-event setup and post-event cleaning.

People who thrive as ushers combine customer service skills with venue knowledge and the calm that managing event crowds requires. Successful ushers develop expertise in their venue while building the people skills that assisting diverse patrons demands. They must remain pleasant despite repetitive questions. Those who struggle often cannot handle the crowd dynamics of events or find the repetitive nature tedious. Others fail because they cannot provide directions accurately or maintain composure during busy arrivals.

Ushering ensures that entertainment patrons reach their seats and have positive venue experiences, with ushers serving as the front-line hospitality workers at theaters and arenas. The field serves as entry to entertainment venues. Ushers appear in discussions of event operations, customer service, and the workforce serving entertainment patrons.
