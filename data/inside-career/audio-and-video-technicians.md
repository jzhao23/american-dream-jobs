The audio and video technician sets up and operates equipment for events, broadcasts, and productions—ensuring audiences hear and see what they're supposed to. A typical day varies by setting: live event techs load in equipment and run shows, broadcast technicians operate studio systems, and corporate AV techs support meetings and presentations. Perhaps 50% of time goes to equipment operation—mixing audio, switching video, and managing the technical systems that productions require. Another 30% involves setup and troubleshooting: configuring equipment, running cables, and solving the problems that inevitably arise. The remaining time splits between equipment maintenance, client coordination, and the teardown that follows events.

People who thrive in AV work combine technical aptitude with calm under pressure and tolerance for the irregular schedules that event work involves. Successful technicians develop expertise across equipment types while adapting to the variety of venues and requirements each project brings. They handle the stress of live production where problems must be solved in real-time. Those who struggle often cannot maintain composure when equipment fails during shows or find the physical demands of gear handling unsustainable. Others fail because they prefer the technical work but cannot manage the client-facing aspects. The work offers variety but demands flexibility.

AV technology has evolved from simple PA systems to complex digital production. The profession has professionalized through certification (CTS) and specialized expertise. The work appears in media through its results—concerts, broadcasts, and events that showcase production value—while technicians remain invisible.

Practitioners cite the satisfaction of successful productions and the variety of the work as primary rewards. The creative technical aspects appeal to those who enjoy problem-solving. The freelance opportunities provide flexibility for some. Working on high-profile events offers excitement. Common frustrations include the irregular hours—nights, weekends, and extended days during events—and the physical demands of loading heavy equipment. Many find the feast-or-famine nature of event work stressful. The gig economy dynamics create income uncertainty.

This career develops through technical education, on-the-job training, or audio/video production programs. CTS certification provides industry credentials. The role suits those who enjoy technical production and can handle the schedule and physical demands. It is poorly suited to those who need regular hours, find equipment handling too physical, or struggle with live production pressure. Compensation varies by setting, with broadcast and touring positions often offering higher rates than corporate AV.
