The anthropology and archaeology professor teaches and researches human cultures—educating students about human diversity, cultural practices, and our species' past while producing scholarship that advances understanding of what it means to be human. A typical week during the academic term blends teaching with research and service. Perhaps 35% of time goes to teaching: preparing lectures, conducting seminars, supervising student projects. Another 40% involves research—conducting fieldwork, analyzing data, writing papers. The remaining time splits between grading, committee work, advising, and professional activities.

People who thrive as anthropology and archaeology professors combine deep knowledge of human cultures with teaching ability and the skills for field research that may involve extended time in other cultures or archaeological sites. Successful professors develop research specializations while building the pedagogical skills that bringing cultural understanding to students requires. They must balance extensive fieldwork with teaching responsibilities and often navigate complex relationships with communities studied. Those who struggle often cannot manage field research logistics or find the time away from fieldwork limiting. Others fail because they cannot translate fieldwork insights into engaging teaching.

Anthropology and archaeology education provides understanding of human cultural diversity and our species' history while advancing knowledge through research that often involves extended immersion in other ways of life. The field connects past and present human experience across the globe. Anthropology and archaeology professors appear in discussions of cultural education, human origins research, and the academic institutions that train anthropologists.

Practitioners cite the intellectual richness of studying human diversity and the adventure of fieldwork as primary rewards. The research provides deep engagement with human experience. The fieldwork involves fascinating cultures and places. The teaching broadens students' cultural awareness. The work documents cultures under pressure. The questions about human nature are profound. Common frustrations include the limited academic job market and the challenge of maintaining field research with teaching obligations. Many find that fieldwork funding is difficult to secure. Ethical complexities of studying other cultures are significant. Archaeological sites are increasingly threatened. The field has confronted its colonial legacy.

This career requires a doctoral degree in anthropology or archaeology, with fieldwork experience and research productivity essential. Strong research, teaching, and fieldwork skills are required. The role suits those passionate about human cultural diversity who can conduct extensive field research. It is poorly suited to those uncomfortable with extended fieldwork, preferring laboratory research, or seeking stable schedules. Compensation is modest, with the academic job market highly competitive.
