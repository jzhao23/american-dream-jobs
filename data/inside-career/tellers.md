The bank teller handles customer transactions at financial institutions—cashing checks, processing deposits and withdrawals, handling payments, and providing the personal banking service that customers require. A typical day centers on window transactions. Perhaps 75% of time goes to transaction processing: cashing checks, accepting deposits, processing withdrawals, handling payments. Another 20% involves customer service—answering questions, explaining services, resolving account issues. The remaining time addresses balancing, documentation, and administrative duties.

People who thrive as tellers combine accuracy with customer service skills and the composure that handling money and sometimes difficult customers requires. Successful tellers develop speed and precision in transactions while building the relationship skills that identifying customer needs and cross-selling services demands. They must maintain accuracy under customer pressure. Those who struggle often cannot meet the sales expectations now common for tellers or find the repetitive transactions tedious. Others fail because they cannot balance their cash accurately or handle the stress of cash responsibility.

Bank telling represents the front-line customer interface of retail banking, though the role has contracted significantly as ATMs, mobile banking, and digital services reduced transaction volumes. Remaining positions emphasize customer relationship and sales functions. Tellers appear in discussions of banking careers, financial services entry, and the impact of automation on service occupations.
