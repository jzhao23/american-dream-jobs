The professional musician and singer performs music—playing instruments or singing in settings from orchestras to rock bands to studio sessions to solo recitals. A typical week varies dramatically by career type. Perhaps 50% of time goes to performance and preparation: practicing, rehearsing, performing live or in studios. Another 25% involves career development—networking, auditioning, promoting performances, managing business. The remaining time addresses travel, equipment maintenance, and the administrative demands of typically self-employed careers.

People who thrive as professional musicians combine exceptional musical ability with the entrepreneurial drive that sustaining musical careers requires. Successful musicians develop technical mastery and interpretive depth while building the business and networking skills that finding and maintaining work demands. They must maintain performance excellence while handling career instability. Those who struggle often cannot manage the business aspects of musical careers or find the constant audition and rejection cycle demoralizing. Others fail because they cannot adapt to the diverse performance opportunities that cobbling together musical income requires.
