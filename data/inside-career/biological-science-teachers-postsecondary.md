The biological sciences professor teaches and researches biology—educating students in molecular biology, ecology, genetics, and other life sciences while producing scholarship that advances understanding of living systems. A typical week during the academic term blends teaching with research and service. Perhaps 30% of time goes to teaching: preparing lectures, conducting classes and labs, meeting with students. Another 45% involves research—managing laboratories, supervising students, writing grants and papers. The remaining time splits between grading, committee work, advising, and professional activities.

People who thrive as biological sciences professors combine deep scientific expertise with teaching ability and the entrepreneurial skills that building successful research programs requires. Successful professors develop research specializations while building the pedagogical skills that biology education demands. They must secure research funding, mentor students, and maintain productive laboratories. Those who struggle often cannot secure the grants that research requires or find the competition for funding exhausting. Others fail because they cannot manage research groups effectively or produce publications at expected rates.

Biological sciences education prepares students for careers in research, medicine, and biotechnology while advancing knowledge of life at scales from molecules to ecosystems. The field has been transformed by molecular biology, genomics, and computational approaches. Biological sciences professors appear in discussions of life sciences education, biomedical research, and the academic institutions that train the biomedical workforce.

Practitioners cite the intellectual excitement of biological discovery and the satisfaction of training future scientists as primary rewards. The research addresses fundamental questions about life. The field advances rapidly with new technologies. The students may contribute to biomedical breakthroughs. The work contributes to knowledge with potential medical applications. The scientific community is intellectually engaging. Common frustrations include the extremely competitive funding environment and the long training periods before independent research positions. Many find that most graduate students cannot obtain academic positions. The pressure to publish is intense. Laboratory management consumes research time. The job market is brutally competitive.

This career requires a doctoral degree in biological sciences plus postdoctoral training, with research productivity essential. Strong research, teaching, and grant-writing skills are required. The role suits those passionate about biological research who can compete in academic science. It is poorly suited to those uncomfortable with funding uncertainty, preferring teaching over research, or seeking positions outside major research institutions. Compensation is moderate relative to training length, with the academic job market extremely competitive.
