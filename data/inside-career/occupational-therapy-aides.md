The occupational therapy aide supports OT services through non-clinical tasks—preparing treatment areas, transporting patients, maintaining equipment, and handling clerical work that enables therapists and assistants to focus on patient care. A typical day involves operational support. Perhaps 50% of time goes to preparation: setting up treatment areas, gathering supplies, organizing materials. Another 30% involves patient support—transporting patients, assisting with positioning, providing general help. The remaining time addresses equipment maintenance, clerical tasks, and cleaning.

People who thrive as OT aides combine organizational skills with patient interaction ability and willingness to support without providing direct treatment. Successful aides develop efficiency in support tasks while building the anticipation skills that keeping therapy operations running smoothly requires. They must find satisfaction in enabling others' work. Those who struggle often become frustrated by the non-clinical nature of the role or find the support tasks tedious. Others fail because they cannot maintain boundaries between support and treatment.
