The library science professor prepares future librarians and information professionals—teaching courses in collection development, cataloging, reference services, and information technology while conducting research on information organization and access. A typical week divides between teaching, research, and professional service. Perhaps 40% of time goes to classroom instruction—courses on information organization, research methods, digital libraries, and archives management. Another 30% involves research and writing: studying information behavior, publishing in scholarly journals, and presenting at conferences. The remaining time splits between advising graduate students, supervising field placements, and professional committee work.

People who thrive as library science professors combine intellectual engagement with information systems and genuine passion for preparing information professionals. Successful professors develop research programs in their specialty—metadata, user experience, digital preservation, or information literacy—while maintaining currency with rapidly evolving technology and professional practice. They connect with practitioners to ensure curricula remain relevant. Those who struggle often become too theoretical, losing touch with the practical realities of library work. Others fail because small program size limits research collaboration or they find the declining number of library programs concerning. The field's evolution creates uncertainty.

Library and information science education has transformed as the field has evolved from physical collections to digital information systems. Pioneers like S.R. Ranganathan developed foundational classification theory. More recently, faculty have grappled with how to prepare students for roles that didn't exist when they were trained. The field appears in debates about the future of libraries and information professions, with some questioning whether traditional library education remains relevant.

Practitioners cite the intellectual engagement of information science and the opportunity to shape the profession as primary rewards. The collegial atmosphere of library schools appeals to many. Seeing graduates succeed in diverse information roles provides satisfaction. The connection to libraries' service mission provides meaning. Common frustrations include the shrinking number of library science programs and the uncertainty about the field's direction. Many find the low enrollment in some programs concerning. The tension between traditional librarianship and broader information science creates curricular debates.

This career requires a doctoral degree in library and information science, typically a PhD. Professional library experience is valued. The role suits those fascinated by information organization and access who enjoy academic work. It is poorly suited to those who prefer direct library service, find academic research tedious, or are uncomfortable with the field's uncertain evolution. Compensation follows academic norms, with relatively few positions available in a small field.
