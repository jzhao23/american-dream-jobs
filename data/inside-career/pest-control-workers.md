The pest control worker eliminates unwanted creatures—inspecting properties, applying pesticides, setting traps, and protecting buildings from the insects, rodents, and other pests that threaten health and property. A typical day involves multiple service calls. Perhaps 55% of time goes to treatment: inspecting for pests, applying products, setting devices. Another 25% involves customer interaction—explaining services, educating about prevention, addressing concerns. The remaining time addresses travel between calls, equipment maintenance, and documentation.

People who thrive in pest control combine technical knowledge with customer service ability and comfort handling pests and chemicals. Successful workers develop expertise in pest behavior and control methods while building the customer relationships that service industries require. They must remain calm around creatures many people fear. Those who struggle often cannot handle the creatures they're eliminating or find the chemical exposure concerning. Others fail because they cannot build customer relationships or explain services effectively.

Pest control protects properties from the pests that threaten health, comfort, and structures, with workers providing the expertise and treatments that eliminate infestations. The field serves essential public health functions. Pest control workers appear in discussions of property maintenance, public health, and the workforce protecting buildings from pests.
