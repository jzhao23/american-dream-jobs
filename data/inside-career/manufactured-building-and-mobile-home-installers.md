The manufactured home installer sets up prefabricated buildings—moving mobile homes, assembling modular units, and preparing the structures that affordable housing depends on. A typical day centers on installation work. Perhaps 75% of time goes to setup: positioning homes, leveling foundations, connecting utilities, joining modular sections. Another 15% involves repair—fixing transit damage, adjusting components, addressing structural issues. The remaining time addresses customer coordination and site preparation.

People who thrive as manufactured home installers combine construction skills with mechanical ability and the physical capability that heavy structural work requires. Successful installers develop proficiency with setup procedures while building the precision that proper leveling demands. They must achieve exact positioning—homes that are not level develop problems. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical demands or find the outdoor work challenging. Others fail because they cannot achieve the precision that proper installation requires.

The field provides affordable housing options and requires skilled installation.
