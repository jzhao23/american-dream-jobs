The training and development specialist designs and delivers programs that build employee skills—assessing training needs, developing curriculum, facilitating sessions, and evaluating whether learning translates to performance improvement. A typical week varies by role focus. Trainers delivering programs spend substantial time in classrooms or virtual sessions, with preparation and follow-up consuming remaining hours. Those focused on development spend more time needs assessment, content creation, vendor evaluation, and program design. Most roles blend delivery with development, with time splitting across facilitation, content creation, stakeholder coordination, and administrative tasks.

People who thrive as training specialists combine instructional design knowledge with platform skills and genuine enthusiasm for helping others learn. Successful specialists develop expertise in adult learning principles while building facilitation skills that engage diverse audiences. They must balance learning best practices against organizational constraints and measure impact in environments that resist rigorous evaluation. Those who struggle often cannot engage reluctant learners or find the repetition of delivering similar content tedious. Others fail because they cannot adapt programs to different audiences or organizational contexts.
