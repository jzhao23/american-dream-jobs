The service attendant supports vehicles and watercraft—providing fuel, basic services, and customer assistance at service stations and marinas. A typical shift centers on customer service. Perhaps 70% of time goes to direct service: dispensing fuel, checking fluids, cleaning windshields, providing basic assistance. Another 20% involves facility maintenance—restocking supplies, maintaining pumps, cleaning service areas. The remaining time addresses payment processing and customer inquiries.

People who thrive as service attendants combine customer service orientation with basic vehicle knowledge and the reliability that service operations require. Successful attendants develop familiarity with service procedures while building the efficiency that busy stations demand. They must interact pleasantly with customers while performing routine services quickly. Those who struggle often cannot handle the routine nature of the work or find the outdoor conditions challenging. Others fail because they cannot maintain the customer service demeanor that repeat business requires.
