The communications professor teaches courses in media, journalism, public relations, and organizational communication—preparing students for careers in rapidly evolving media environments while often conducting research on communication processes and effects. A typical week divides between teaching, research, and professional engagement. Perhaps 40% of time goes to classroom instruction—courses on media production, public speaking, journalism, public relations, and communication theory. Another 35% involves research and creative work: studying communication phenomena, producing professional work, and publishing findings. The remaining time splits between advising students, supervising internships, and maintaining industry connections.

People who thrive as communications professors combine academic rigor with professional currency in a field that evolves constantly. Successful professors develop research programs or maintain professional practice while helping students develop both theoretical understanding and practical skills. They navigate between academic scholarship and professional preparation. Those who struggle often become disconnected from rapidly changing media industries or cannot balance theoretical and applied approaches to student satisfaction. Others fail because they find the academic aspects of the role tedious compared to professional media work. The field's breadth—from rhetorical theory to social media marketing—creates identity questions.

Communications has grown from speech and journalism programs to encompass the full range of media and messaging in contemporary society. The field's founders drew from rhetoric, sociology, psychology, and journalism traditions. Communications programs have expanded as media's role in society has grown. The field appears in discussions of media literacy, journalism ethics, and the impact of technology on communication. Digital disruption has transformed both the industry and the academic field.

Practitioners cite the intellectual engagement of studying communication and the opportunity to prepare students for media careers as primary rewards. The dynamic nature of the field keeps work fresh. Connections to professional media offer opportunities beyond academia. Student enthusiasm for media careers energizes teaching. Common frustrations include the challenge of keeping curricula current with rapidly changing technology and industry practices. Many find the tension between academic and professional orientations within departments frustrating. Media industry disruption creates uncertainty about what students should learn. Job markets for both graduates and faculty can be challenging.

This career requires a doctoral degree in communications, journalism, or related field, though some positions value professional experience heavily. Industry experience provides credibility for professionally-oriented programs. The role suits those interested in communication who enjoy the combination of teaching, research, and professional engagement. It is poorly suited to those who prefer either pure scholarship or pure professional practice. Compensation follows academic norms, with professional programs sometimes offering additional opportunities for consulting or professional work.
