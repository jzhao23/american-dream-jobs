The reservation agent books travel—making airline, hotel, or other travel reservations, issuing tickets, assisting passengers, and handling the transactions that enable travel. A typical shift centers on booking activity. Perhaps 70% of time goes to reservations: making bookings, modifying itineraries, issuing tickets, processing payments. Another 20% involves customer service—answering questions, resolving problems, handling complaints and changes. The remaining time addresses documentation, system updates, and coordination with other departments.

People who thrive as reservation agents combine system proficiency with customer service ability and the composure that handling travel problems requires. Successful agents develop expertise in booking systems and fare structures while building the problem-solving skills that resolving travel complications demands. They must maintain patience with stressed travelers. Those who struggle often cannot navigate the complex booking systems or find the repetitive transactions tedious. Others fail because they cannot handle angry customers whose travel plans have gone wrong.

Reservation and ticketing serves as the transaction layer of travel, with agents processing the bookings that enable movement. The field has contracted significantly as online booking replaced human agents. Remaining positions concentrate at airports, call centers, and travel agencies. These workers appear in discussions of travel industry careers, customer service, and the occupations most affected by e-commerce.
