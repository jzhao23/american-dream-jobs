The costume attendant maintains and assists with costumes—preparing garments for performers, making repairs, assisting with quick changes, and maintaining the wardrobe that theatrical and entertainment productions require. A typical production day blends preparation with performance support. Perhaps 50% of time goes to maintenance: cleaning, pressing, repairing costumes. Another 35% involves performance support—assisting performers with changes, managing wardrobe during shows. The remaining time addresses organization, inventory, and costume preparation.

Successful attendants develop expertise in costume care while building the speed and accuracy that quick changes demand. They must remain calm during the chaos of performance.
