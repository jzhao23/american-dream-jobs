The infantry officer leads ground combat forces—commanding soldiers in the close combat that controls terrain and defeats enemies. A typical duty period combines training and leadership. Perhaps 45% of time involves tactical training: leading patrols, conducting exercises, practicing battle drills, developing tactical skills. Another 40% addresses leadership—training soldiers, maintaining equipment, building unit cohesion. The remaining time covers planning and administrative duties.

People who thrive as infantry officers combine tactical expertise with physical capability and the leadership that close combat demands. Successful officers develop proficiency with infantry tactics while building the trust that soldiers follow into danger. They must lead from the front while making sound decisions under extreme stress. Those who struggle often cannot handle the physical demands of infantry operations or find the combat exposure traumatic. Others fail because they cannot develop the rapport with soldiers that effective infantry leadership requires.

Infantry leadership represents the core of ground combat, with officers leading the soldiers who close with and destroy enemies. The field serves Army and Marine Corps infantry units. Infantry officers appear in discussions of combat arms, military leadership, and the officers who lead America's ground forces in battle.

The physical challenge is embraced by many. Combat arms leadership is highly respected. Career progression to senior command exists. The mission is clear and important.
