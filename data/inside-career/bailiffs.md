The bailiff maintains order and security in courtrooms—protecting judges and court personnel, managing defendants, controlling access, and ensuring that legal proceedings occur safely and without disruption. A typical day centers on courtroom security. Perhaps 60% of time goes to courtroom duties: maintaining order, escorting defendants, protecting the court. Another 25% involves screening and access control—checking people entering court, maintaining secure areas. The remaining time addresses prisoner transport, evidence handling, and administrative duties.

People who thrive as bailiffs combine security awareness with courtroom decorum and the calm authority that managing tense legal situations requires. Successful bailiffs develop expertise in courtroom procedures while building the presence that maintaining order demands. They must project authority without creating confrontation.

Others fail because they cannot manage defendants who may be desperate or dangerous.
