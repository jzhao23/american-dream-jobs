The concierge serves as the information and assistance hub for hotel guests or residential tenants—making reservations, arranging services, providing recommendations, and solving the problems that travelers and residents encounter. A typical shift centers on guest assistance. Perhaps 60% of time goes to direct service: making restaurant reservations, booking tickets, arranging transportation, providing directions and recommendations. Another 25% involves research and relationship building—maintaining knowledge of local options, cultivating contacts with restaurants and services, staying current on events. The remaining time addresses administrative tasks and coordination with other departments.

People who thrive as concierges combine encyclopedic local knowledge with resourcefulness and the service mentality that fulfilling unusual requests requires. Successful concierges develop deep expertise in their city's offerings while building the network of contacts that enables them to deliver impossible-seeming requests. They must remain unflappable when guests demand the unreasonable. Those who struggle often cannot maintain the knowledge base that comprehensive recommendations require or find the demanding guests exhausting. Others fail because they cannot develop the relationships with local businesses that provide priority access for guests.

The role has evolved as online resources provide basic information, shifting concierge value toward exclusive access and personalized service.
