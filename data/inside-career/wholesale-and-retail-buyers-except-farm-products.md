The retail or wholesale buyer selects merchandise for resale—analyzing sales trends, negotiating with vendors, choosing products, and building assortments that satisfy customer demand while maximizing profitability. A typical week blends market research with vendor negotiation. Perhaps 35% of time goes to merchandise analysis: reviewing sales data, identifying trends, evaluating product performance. Another 30% involves vendor interaction—meeting with suppliers, negotiating prices, evaluating new products. The remaining time splits between assortment planning, inventory management, marketing coordination, and the administrative tasks that purchasing requires.

People who thrive as buyers combine analytical capability with market intuition and the negotiation skills that securing favorable terms requires. Successful buyers develop expertise in their product categories while building vendor relationships that provide access to the best products and terms. They must balance creative product selection against financial discipline and inventory constraints. Those who struggle often cannot predict customer preferences or find the pressure of buying decisions stressful. Others fail because they cannot negotiate effectively or manage the inventory consequences of buying decisions.

Buying positions exist wherever merchandise is selected for resale—department stores, specialty retailers, distributors, and e-commerce operations. The role combines creative product selection with business analysis, making decisions that significantly affect company profitability.
