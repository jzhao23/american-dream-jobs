The general office clerk performs the varied tasks that keep offices functioning—filing, copying, data entry, answering phones, and handling whatever administrative needs arise. A typical day involves multiple different tasks rather than any single specialized function. Perhaps 30% of time goes to communication tasks—answering phones, greeting visitors, and handling correspondence. Another 30% involves information management: filing, copying, data entry, and maintaining records. The remaining time splits between supporting specific projects, running errands, and whatever tasks emerge as needs arise.

Successful clerks develop familiarity with various office functions while remaining flexible to shifting priorities. They contribute to office functioning without specializing.
