The courier delivers documents and packages—picking up items, transporting them to destinations, obtaining signatures, and providing the personal delivery service that urgent or sensitive materials require. A typical day centers on delivery activity. Perhaps 80% of time goes to deliveries: navigating to pickup and delivery locations, making exchanges, obtaining necessary signatures. Another 15% involves logistics—planning routes, communicating with dispatch, handling paperwork. The remaining time addresses vehicle maintenance and administrative duties.

People who thrive as couriers combine navigation ability with reliability and the independence that unsupervised route work provides. Successful couriers develop efficiency in route planning while building the professionalism that handling important deliveries demands. They must be completely dependable. Those who struggle often cannot handle the pressure of time-sensitive deliveries or find the constant movement exhausting. Others fail because they cannot navigate effectively or maintain the reliability that courier work requires.

Courier service provides personal delivery when electronic transmission or standard shipping won't suffice—legal documents, medical specimens, time-critical materials. The field has evolved as technology changed what requires physical delivery. Couriers appear in discussions of delivery services, logistics operations, and the workers who move urgent items through cities.

Practitioners cite the independence and the movement as primary rewards. The independent route work suits self-directed personalities. The movement is preferable to desk work. The variety of locations provides interest. The schedule may offer flexibility. The work is straightforward and tangible. The entry is accessible. Common frustrations include the physical demands and the traffic. Many find that navigating traffic and parking is stressful. The exposure to weather is constant. The vehicle costs cut into income. The pay is modest for the responsibility. The time pressure is intense. Benefits are often limited. The work can be lonely.

This career requires reliable transportation and navigation skills. Strong reliability, time management, and professionalism are essential. The role suits those wanting independent mobile work and able to handle delivery pressure. It is poorly suited to those uncomfortable with driving, wanting social work environments, or needing higher compensation. Compensation is low to moderate, often per-delivery.
