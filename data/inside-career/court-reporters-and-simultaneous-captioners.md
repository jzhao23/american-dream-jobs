The court reporter and captioner creates verbatim records of spoken words—using stenography or voice writing to capture proceedings in courts, depositions, legislative sessions, and for real-time captioning of broadcasts and events. A typical day involves intense, focused transcription. Perhaps 70% of time goes to active recording: capturing spoken words at speeds exceeding 200 words per minute. Another 20% involves transcript preparation—editing raw output, formatting documents, producing final records. The remaining time addresses equipment maintenance, certification requirements, and client communication.

People who thrive as court reporters and captioners combine exceptional listening skills with the manual dexterity that stenography requires or the speaking precision that voice writing demands. Successful reporters develop speed and accuracy through intensive practice while building the focus that capturing every word for hours requires. They must remain alert and precise through lengthy proceedings. Those who struggle often cannot develop sufficient speed to work professionally or find the intense concentration exhausting. Others fail because they cannot handle the pressure of knowing that legal records depend on their accuracy.

Court reporting and captioning creates official records of spoken proceedings, with reporters serving legal and governmental needs while captioners enable accessibility for deaf and hard-of-hearing audiences.
