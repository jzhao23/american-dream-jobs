The rental clerk processes equipment and vehicle rentals—greeting customers, completing rental agreements, explaining terms, inspecting equipment, and handling the transactions that temporary use of goods requires. A typical shift centers on customer transactions. Perhaps 65% of time goes to rental processing: completing agreements, explaining policies, processing payments, handling returns and inspections. Another 25% involves customer service—answering questions, making recommendations, resolving complaints. The remaining time addresses inventory, cleaning returned items, and administrative duties.

People who thrive as rental clerks combine customer service skills with attention to detail and the composure that handling rental disputes requires. Successful clerks develop expertise in their rental products while building the sales skills that add-on services and upgrades require. They must balance efficiency with thoroughness in inspections. Those who struggle often cannot handle the pace during peak periods or find the repetitive transactions tedious. Others fail because they cannot navigate the confrontations that rental damage disputes create.

Rental counter work serves diverse industries—from car rentals to tool hire to equipment leasing—with clerks handling the transactions that enable temporary access to goods. The field varies by product type and customer base. Rental clerks appear in discussions of service industry employment, retail operations, and the workers who facilitate the sharing economy's traditional predecessor.
