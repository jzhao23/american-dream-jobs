The armor crew member operates tanks and armored vehicles—serving as gunner, driver, or loader in the crews that man America's armored forces. A typical duty period combines training and maintenance. Perhaps 50% of time involves vehicle operations: gunnery training, tactical exercises, operating assigned systems. Another 35% addresses maintenance—servicing vehicles, maintaining weapons, preparing equipment. The remaining time covers training and administrative duties.

People who thrive as armor crew members combine technical skill with physical capability and the teamwork that tank crews demand. Successful crew members develop proficiency with their assigned position while building the crew coordination that combat effectiveness requires. They must perform precisely under the stress of simulated and actual combat. Those who struggle often cannot handle the confined spaces of armored vehicles or find the physical demands exhausting. Others fail because they cannot develop the crew integration that effective armor operations require.

Armor crew work represents ground combat operations, with enlisted members manning the tanks and vehicles that dominate battlefields. The field serves Army and Marine Corps armor and cavalry units. Crew members appear in discussions of combat arms, enlisted ground combat, and the soldiers who crew armored vehicles.
