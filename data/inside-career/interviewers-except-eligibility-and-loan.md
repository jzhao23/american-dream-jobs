The interviewer collects information through structured questioning—conducting surveys, completing applications, gathering data for research or business purposes, and recording the responses that organizations need. A typical day centers on interviewing activity. Perhaps 75% of time goes to conducting interviews: asking questions, recording responses, clarifying answers, completing forms. Another 15% involves data handling—reviewing completed forms, entering data, identifying problems. The remaining time addresses scheduling, training, and coordination with supervisors.

People who thrive as interviewers combine communication skills with attention to detail and the neutrality that accurate data collection requires. Successful interviewers develop efficiency in their questioning protocols while building the rapport skills that encourage complete responses. They must ask questions without leading answers. Those who struggle often cannot maintain the structured approach that consistent data requires or find the repetitive questioning tedious. Others fail because they cannot build the rapport that elicits honest, complete responses.

Interviewing serves as the human data collection function across research, healthcare, and business contexts, with interviewers gathering the information that enables decision-making. The field varies from market research to patient intake to survey administration. Interviewers appear in discussions of research methodology, data collection, and the workers who convert human responses into usable information.
