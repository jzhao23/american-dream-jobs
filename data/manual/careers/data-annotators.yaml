# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Data Annotators label and categorize data used to train artificial intelligence and machine learning models. They identify objects in images, transcribe audio, classify text sentiment, verify AI outputs, and create the high-quality training datasets that make modern AI systems possible.

  This emerging role has exploded with the AI boom, with demand at AI companies, tech giants, and specialized data labeling firms. Work can range from entry-level tasks done remotely to specialized annotation requiring domain expertise (medical imaging, legal documents). Many positions offer flexible, remote work arrangements.

  Data Annotation provides an accessible entry point into the AI industry without requiring a technical degree. While some tasks are straightforward, specialized annotators with domain expertise (healthcare, legal, scientific) command higher wages. Career paths lead to quality assurance, annotation team leadership, or transitions into ML engineering with additional training.

    Data Annotators have high AI exposure as AI systems increasingly automate basic labeling tasks, with humans focusing on edge cases and quality verification. Paradoxically, current growth of 40%+ is driven by massive AI training data needs. However, the role is evolving - basic annotation is being automated while demand grows for specialized annotators who can handle nuanced, domain-specific tasks. Long-term outlook depends on AI capabilities.
