description: |
  Recruiters source, screen, and hire talent for organizations. They identify qualified candidates, conduct interviews, manage hiring pipelines, and serve as the bridge between job seekers and employers. Their work directly impacts organizational success by ensuring companies find the right people for critical roles.

  These professionals work in-house at companies (corporate recruiters), at staffing agencies, or as independent headhunters. Specializations include technical recruiting, executive search, healthcare recruiting, and high-volume hiring. The work involves significant relationship building, both with candidates and hiring managers.

  Recruiting offers accessible entry points, commission-based earning potential, and the satisfaction of helping people find meaningful work. Top technical recruiters and executive search professionals can earn exceptional compensation. Career paths lead to recruiting management, talent acquisition leadership, or HR business partner roles.
