# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Management Consultants advise organizations on strategy, operations, and transformation. They analyze business problems, develop recommendations, and help clients implement changes to improve performance, reduce costs, or navigate major transitions like mergers, digital transformation, or market expansion.

  These professionals work at consulting firms ranging from elite strategy houses (McKinsey, BCG, Bain) to Big Four firms (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) to specialized boutiques. The work involves significant client interaction, data analysis, presentation development, and travel. Projects typically last weeks to months, providing variety across industries and problem types.

  Management Consulting offers excellent compensation, rapid skill development, and exposure to senior executives across industries. The demanding lifestyle includes long hours and travel. Career paths lead to partner roles at consulting firms, or "exit opportunities" to corporate strategy, private equity, or executive leadership positions.
