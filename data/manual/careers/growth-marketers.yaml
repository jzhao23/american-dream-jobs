    Growth Marketers have moderate-high AI exposure as AI automates ad optimization, content generation, and basic analytics. However, strategic channel selection, creative campaign concepts, and understanding user psychology require human creativity and judgment. Growth of 15% reflects continued digital marketing demand. AI significantly augments productivity but strategic growth thinking remains human-driven.
