# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  UX/Product Designers create user-centered digital experiences by researching user needs, designing interfaces, and validating solutions. They own the end-to-end design process from problem definition to final implementation, ensuring products are intuitive, accessible, and delightful to use.

  These professionals work primarily in technology but UX roles exist across e-commerce, finance, healthcare, and any industry with digital products. They collaborate closely with product managers, engineers, and researchers in iterative design processes. Modern product design combines traditional UX skills with visual design, prototyping, and systems thinking.

  UX/Product Design offers strong compensation, creative fulfillment, and direct impact on how millions of people interact with technology. Portfolios demonstrating user-centered thinking and business impact are essential for advancement. Career paths lead to senior/staff design roles, design management, or specialization in research, systems, or accessibility.

    UX/Product Designers have moderate AI exposure as AI tools can generate UI mockups, create variations, and assist with design system management. However, understanding human psychology, conducting user research, and making strategic design decisions require deep empathy and creativity. Growth of 16% reflects continued demand for digital products. Human advantage is high due to empathy-driven design thinking.
