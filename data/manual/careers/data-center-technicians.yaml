# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Data Center Technicians install, maintain, and repair the physical infrastructure that powers cloud computing and the internet. They work with servers, networking equipment, storage systems, and the power and cooling systems that keep data centers running 24/7.

  These professionals work at cloud providers (AWS, Google, Microsoft), colocation facilities, and enterprises with on-premises data centers. The work is hands-on and physical, involving server rack installation, cable management, hardware troubleshooting, and responding to equipment failures. Shifts often include nights and weekends to provide continuous coverage.

  Data Center Technician roles offer stable employment, good pay without requiring a four-year degree, and a path into IT careers. The explosive growth of cloud computing and AI has dramatically increased demand. Career paths lead to senior technician roles, data center operations management, or transitions to network engineering or cloud operations.

  classificationRationale: |
    Data Center Technicians have very low AI exposure because the work requires physical presence - installing servers, running cables, troubleshooting hardware failures, and responding to facility issues. AI cannot replace hands-on work. Growth of 28%+ is driven by cloud expansion and AI infrastructure buildout. Essential human advantage from physical presence requirements. Ironically, more AI means more data centers and more technicians needed.
