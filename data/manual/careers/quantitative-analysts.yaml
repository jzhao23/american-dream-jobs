# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Quantitative Analysts (Quants) develop mathematical models for pricing, trading, and risk management in financial markets. They apply advanced mathematics, statistics, and programming to analyze market data, build trading algorithms, and help financial institutions make data-driven investment decisions.

  These professionals work primarily at investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, and proprietary trading firms. The work is highly technical, combining finance domain knowledge with serious mathematical and programming skills. Quants often specialize in areas like derivatives pricing, algorithmic trading, or risk modeling.

  Quantitative Analysis offers exceptional compensation among the highest in any field, intellectually challenging work, and direct impact on trading outcomes. The role typically requires an advanced degree in a quantitative field. Career paths lead to senior quant roles, portfolio management, or founding quantitative trading firms.

    Quantitative Analysts have moderate AI exposure as ML models increasingly automate pattern recognition and basic modeling tasks. However, developing novel trading strategies, understanding market microstructure, and making risk decisions requires deep expertise and creativity. AI becomes a powerful tool that quants leverage rather than a replacement. Growth of 20% reflects continued demand for quantitative approaches in finance.
