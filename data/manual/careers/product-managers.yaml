# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Product Managers define the vision, strategy, and roadmap for products, working at the intersection of business, technology, and user experience. They identify customer needs, prioritize features, and guide cross-functional teams through the product development lifecycle from ideation to launch and beyond.

  Product Managers are ubiquitous in the technology industry and increasingly common in traditional industries undergoing digital transformation. They work closely with engineering, design, marketing, and sales teams, often acting as the "CEO of the product" without direct authority. The role requires balancing competing stakeholder needs while keeping the team focused on delivering value to customers.

  This career offers strong compensation, significant influence over product direction, and a path to senior leadership. PMs can advance to Group PM, Director of Product, VP of Product, or CPO roles. Many also transition to general management, entrepreneurship, or venture capital.

    Product Managers have low AI exposure because their core work involves understanding human needs, making strategic decisions with incomplete information, and navigating organizational dynamics - tasks that require deep human judgment. AI tools can assist with data analysis, user research synthesis, and documentation, but cannot replace the empathy needed to understand customer pain points, the judgment to prioritize competing demands, or the leadership to align teams around a vision. Strong job growth continues as more companies become software-driven. This role has high human advantage across empathy, opinion-forming, and hope/inspiration dimensions.
