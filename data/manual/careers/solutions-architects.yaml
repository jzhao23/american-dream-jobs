# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Solutions Architects design comprehensive technical solutions that address complex business challenges. They work at the intersection of technology and business, translating requirements into system architectures, evaluating technologies, and guiding implementation teams to ensure successful delivery.

  These professionals work at technology vendors (AWS, Microsoft, Google), consulting firms, and enterprises. They often support sales teams by demonstrating technical feasibility, designing proof-of-concepts, and building trust with technical stakeholders. The work involves significant client interaction, presentations, and staying current with rapidly evolving technology landscapes.

  Solutions Architecture offers excellent compensation, variety in projects, and the opportunity to influence major technology decisions. The role requires both deep technical expertise and strong communication skills. Career paths lead to principal architect roles, CTO positions, or senior consulting roles. Cloud vendor certifications (AWS SA, Azure Solutions Architect) are highly valued.

  classificationRationale: |
    Solutions Architects have low AI exposure because the role fundamentally requires understanding unique business contexts, building relationships with stakeholders, and making judgment calls about complex tradeoffs. AI cannot replicate the trust-building, presentation skills, and creative problem-solving needed to design solutions for novel business challenges. Growth of 25%+ reflects cloud adoption and digital transformation.
