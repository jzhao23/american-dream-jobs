# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  AI/ML Engineers design, develop, and deploy machine learning models and artificial intelligence systems. They work at the intersection of software engineering and data science, building the algorithms and infrastructure that power intelligent applications from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.

  These professionals work across nearly every industry, with particularly high demand in technology, finance, healthcare, and e-commerce. Most work in office or hybrid settings at tech companies, startups, research labs, or as part of digital transformation teams at traditional enterprises. The work involves significant coding, experimentation, and collaboration with data scientists and product teams.

  This career offers exceptional compensation, strong job security, and the opportunity to work on cutting-edge technology that shapes the future. AI/ML Engineers often advance to Staff/Principal roles, move into AI research, or transition to technical leadership positions. The field requires continuous learning as techniques evolve rapidly.

  classificationRationale: |
    AI/ML Engineers have moderate exposure to AI automation because while AI tools can assist with code generation, data preprocessing, and model prototyping, the core work of designing novel architectures, understanding domain problems, and making strategic technical decisions requires deep human judgment. The field is experiencing 35%+ growth driven by AI adoption across industries. Human advantages include high creativity in developing new approaches and strong judgment in balancing model performance, interpretability, and ethical considerations. AI tools augment rather than replace these professionals.
