# DESCRIPTION
# =============================================================================

description: |
  Cybersecurity Analysts monitor, detect, and respond to security threats targeting an organization's systems and data. They analyze security alerts, investigate incidents, implement protective measures, and help organizations maintain their security posture in an increasingly hostile digital landscape.

  These professionals work across all industries, with particularly high demand in finance, healthcare, government, and technology. Many work in Security Operations Centers (SOCs), monitoring systems around the clock. The work involves analyzing logs, responding to alerts, conducting investigations, and collaborating with IT teams to remediate vulnerabilities.

  Cybersecurity offers excellent job security, strong compensation, and meaningful work protecting critical systems. Entry paths include IT support roles, security certifications, or cybersecurity degree programs. Career advancement leads to senior analyst roles, incident response teams, or specialization in threat intelligence, penetration testing, or security engineering.

  classificationRationale: |
    Cybersecurity Analysts have low AI exposure because adversarial thinking, incident investigation, and security decision-making require human judgment. Attackers are humans who constantly evolve tactics. While AI enhances detection capabilities, analysts must interpret alerts, investigate incidents, and make critical decisions under pressure. Growth of 32%+ is driven by increasing cyber threats. High human advantage from judgment and adversarial thinking.
