description: |
  Executive Assistants provide high-level administrative support to senior executives, managing complex calendars, coordinating meetings, handling confidential information, and serving as gatekeepers who help leaders maximize their effectiveness. The role goes far beyond basic administrative tasks to include project management, communication, and strategic support.

  These professionals work across all industries, supporting C-suite executives, founders, and senior leaders. The work requires exceptional judgment, discretion, and the ability to anticipate needs. Top EAs become trusted partners who influence executive decision-making and organizational priorities.

  Executive Assistant roles at senior levels offer strong compensation, direct exposure to leadership, and significant impact on organizational success. Career paths lead to Chief of Staff roles, office management, operations leadership, or specialized EA roles supporting high-profile executives. The best EAs are in high demand and command premium compensation.
