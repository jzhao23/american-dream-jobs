    "text": "Joey Swoll, a TikTok personality known for calling out bad gym behavior and etiquette, while selling his fitness programs, gets himself called out for his defense of a very controversial figure. \n\nNow he's on the other side of the cancel cannon, and I can't help but feel like it's the natural cycle of influencing. All of his past critics and subjects of his previous posts are going all on him, and he's losing all the work he's done for his image.\n\nWorst of all, since his whole platform was canceling people for a mistake, he can't go back to that after being called out for a mistake he made himself.\n\nSocial media to me just seems like a waste of time because it takes forever to get big and then it seems like it's really easy to lose it all.\n\nEdit: I just now saw his apology video, here's a pro tip, when distancing yourself for praising a racist, don't use racist terms while doing so. Wow",

Hope it was helpful!\n\nNote: It didn't come up in the questions but worth noting that my wife manages the business and essentially does everything that isn't programming or training related. I wouldnt be able to do 40+ sessions/week if I was also managing the schedule, payroll, taxes, rate adjustments, etc. Obviously I'm incredibly fortuate to have a business partner and it's not realistic for most but wanted this out there for transparancy.\n\nFollowing this AMA I created a newsletter that hopes to helps people become better trainers.

    "title": "I lost so many clients in the first 30 days so you don't have to 😭😭",
    "text": "Had a great conversation with one of my trainers and I felt I needed to share this revelation we had. Earlier in my personal training journey I wondered why other trainers kept all their clients and why I struggled to keep mine. We had same certifications, we looked the same physicaly, the clients weren't any different but what was different was he had a full roster of clients all the time and he seemed to get bussier and bussier. At first I thought he was just more knowledgable than me but when I looked closer into what that hour looked like I found out what I was doing wrong. 😭😭 \n\nIn the early stages of my training career I was just over teaching, trying to flex my knowledge, and wisdom. My colleague on the other hand taught very little but noticed that he was \"celebrating\" nearly every session. He celebrated their first week of training, he celebrated their first squat, he celebrated there first week of getting enough protein. The whole time he is stacking wins after wins with their client.  \n\nThen it dawned on me that he made his first 30 days in training like a game. He was stacking wins for them and I was flaunting my wisdom 😭. The moment I saw that I modeled everything I could and I found immediate return. The clients where easier to teach one, the clients where looking forward to coming in more than 3 days a week all of a sudden, clients got results faster, and clients recommended everyone they knew lol. 😊\n\nI needed to share this because it's very common for new trainers to share there knowledge because in some ways I felt like an imposter and I had flex my knowledge and certs to compensate for it. The better strategy I learned overtime was fostering more wins with the them instead sharing all the knowledge I had in fitness. \n\n  \nHere is a quick practical of how you can use this in your client and trainer journey. \n\n1. From Day 1-30 days is to stack as many wins as possible. (This will create confidence for your clients, make them addicted to the process, and lastly they will take on harder challenges because of the inner confidence they stacked the first 30 days from the wins) \n\n2. From Day 31-60 is introducing one mini challenge like a bench mark workout (This will give them something to work towards at the end of your program that they will look forward to beating, if done right you don't have to motivate your clients as hard)\n\n3. From Day 61-90 is where you can actually share your wisdom. This is where you can pepper in more knowledge. Extra credit if you pepper in better form technique related from the mini challenge they just took. (Here your teaching lands harder because I often find they want to beat the next level, the next challenge, the next benchmark. Often times that requires better performance and the technical teaching comes in handy for that.) \n\nThis is an oversimplified timeline but the truth is it can be stretched for years maybe even a decade 😭. It can also be more of a cycle for the clients you have. It could also not work too 😭 but it definitely improved my odds of resigning my clients for more packages. If you guys have other amazing templates that increase your clients retention, let me know always looking to grow.\n\n  \nHere is my final thought on this. Clients just need wins early on and your best tactical level coaching is often in the end. Hope this helps guys and have a good day. 😊",

You shouldn't if you are' \"if you don't want to stay stuck at the gym this is how you should do it\" then started to correctly perform the exercise which fair to her I learnt how to do it better.\n\nBut she didn't stop there,she kept talking to my sister without even making eye contact to me about how she would be fat if she doesn't do exercises correctly, and how she shouldn't trust everyone in the gym. \n\nThen she said that she is a PT herself and basically started doing the sales tactic where she gets into the reasoing of why the person wants to exercise so she can build rapport with my sister(of which she was unaware that we are related at that time).\n\nI then confronted her and said that she's my sister and that i didnt appreciate how she confronted us in which she said I got my feelings hurt because there's thruth to it,which im not denying,I wasn't doing the exercise correctly.\nHowever ive given my mom and siister incredible results,where ive taught them exercises I know exactly how to teach with correct form(but the woman didnt know that)\n\nAnyway we basically argued for 40 mins ,my points were that I ddint appreciate how she disrespected me,her points were that I was whats wrong with the industry and that her 8 year of experience has taught her a lot about how to get results.\n\nMy issue is that I feel incredibly embarrassed,Its to the point where I dont want to go back to my gym anytime soon,because we made a scene, and everyone knows me,but she was just using a day pass(confirmed by management) so I dont know what to do...\n\nAny advice?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "About becoming a personal trainer",
    "text": "Every few days or even hours on some of the bad days, someone posts, “Wannabe PT, wot do bros?” or “I just finished my Cert IV, now what?\" Here’s your answer.\n\nI’ve written a detailed guide for the first two years of your career. Not the Instagram version. The real one. The version with duct-tape dumbbells, floor shifts at 5am, old guys whose underwear is too stretched out to leave anything to the imagination, 140kg men in cycling Lycra, and your own training quietly falling apart while you help everyone else.\n\nIt’s not meant to inspire you. It’s meant to keep your head right.\n\n**Have a training background—or build one now.**\n\n*“Know thyself.”* — Socrates\n\nIdeally, you’ll have a background in an individual competitive sport. Not team, individual. Team dynamics are different. The personal trainer and client are not like the football coach and footballer, more like the track and field coach and thrower or jumper, or the weightlifting coach and weightlifter.\n\nIf you don’t have that background, get a trainer or coach. Set moderately ambitious goals that’ll take 6–12 months to achieve and will involve setbacks along the way—so you learn what it’s like to move around setbacks. Worried about the cost? Worried about whether they’re any good? Congratulations, you just learned your first lesson about PT. Every potential client worries the same.\n\nYou need to be qualified. Qualified means you have the right to try.\n\n**Get certified. Then forget the certificate.**\n\n*“Education is what remains after one has forgotten what one has learned in school.”* — Albert Einstein\n\nThe cert is your ticket in. That’s it. Nobody cares about the letters after your name unless you’re working in a rehab clinic or strength lab. Get the cheapest cert that qualifies you to get insured and work legally. Then get back to work.\n\nYou learn by doing.\n\n**Get a job. It won’t be your dream job.**\n\n*“Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: then stop.”* — Lewis Carroll\n\nStart somewhere—anywhere you can get floor time and interact with members. A globogym, a Y, a community rec centre. Your only goal here is reps: hours on the floor, conversations with members, practice taking a stranger from warmup to cooldown. Your job as a gym instructor is to care and clean.\n\nThis job will suck. You’ll be underpaid. You’ll work weird hours. You'll dust treadmills, and find all 36 of the gym's 20kg plates loaded on one side of the leg press just as you're about to stick your 5ft 50kg client on it. But it’s your apprenticeship. Treat it like one.\n\nTalk to one new person a day. Teach one new person a movement every day. Doesn’t matter what movement—let’s say, a plank. After two years you’ll have talked to and taught 500–1,000 people. You’ll have figured out some things, like who wants to be talked to (iPod earbuds are the passive-aggressive \"no, thank you\"), and who is the plank good for? Maybe not the 55-year-old obese woman with the bad back, whoops.\n\nAfter each interaction, go away and write it down. Reflect. Think about what they said and what you saw. Reflect on it. \n\nSome argue about the ten thousand hours to mastery, but the number isn’t the point. In a study of chess players, grandmasters and intermediates had the same number of tournament games. The difference was, the grandmasters went home and replayed every move, thinking how they could improve. The intermediates just went home and cracked open a beer. (I'm pretty sure the study mentioned beer.)\n\nWrite it down, reflect on it—and follow up a couple of weeks later. See if your suggestion stuck, or if it came crashing down like a street hustler after running out of meth on Saturday night. Like Jen on the treadmill: you help her adjust her stride to save her knees, and the next week she tells you it made all the difference. Or she says she hated it and went back to her old way. Either way, you just learned something. And she told you about her kid's birthday coming up, and you ask how it went. \n\nBy talking to someone every day, you're practicing personal. By teaching someone a movement every day, you're practicing trainer. After two years and 500–1,000 people you may not be a good personal trainer, but you'll be a better one than you were after none. \n\n**Care &amp; clean**\n\n*“If you can’t dazzle them with brilliance, baffle them with kindness.”* — Anonymous\n\nAt the start you will know little or nothing about training. But you can still care and clean. The reasons people give for leaving a gym are: friendliness of the staff, cleanliness of the facilities, and overcrowding. You can't do anything about the last one, but overcrowding is a self-correcting problem. But even the most clueless newbie has control over how friendly they are, and keeping the place clean and tidy. \n\nSay hello. Thank you. Sorry. Goodbye.\n\nHelp someone re-rack plates. Wipe down a bench nobody asked you to. If you see someone struggling and you have a useful cue, ask if they’d like help. Offer to spot. Don’t hard-sell. Just help. People remember that. They start to trust you. Eventually, some of them pay you.\n\nAgain, this is where it helps to have been a personal training client yourself. You're in your gym and you're thinking about getting someone to help you train properly. Do you ask the guy sitting behind the gym desk surfing Lamebook and looking depressed, or the person who's always out on the gym floor keeping the place clean and tidy, chatting to people and helping them out?\n\nYou shouldn't need your picture on the PT profiles on the gym wall for people to know who you are, everyone should know you anyway. As a guide, when you as a trainer cannot get through your own workout because everyone interrupts you to ask you questions, you're probably on the right track. \n\n**Train the people in front of you. Not the imaginary ones.**\n\n*“I had ambitions. Big ones. But none involved real people.”* — Evelyn Waugh\n\nYou won’t get athletes. You’ll get smokers, diabetics, 40-year-olds who move like 80-year-olds, and 20-year-olds with knees that grind. Good. That’s the job.\n\nFigure out what they can do. Make them do it, safely, a little better each week. That’s it. That’s training.\n\nDon’t waste time designing programs for your dream client. You’ll never meet them. You’ll meet Sharon who wants to lose weight but is scared of everything in the free weights area, and Barry whose physio told him he should strengthen his back but didn’t say how. Train Sharon. Train Barry. Do it well, and word gets around.\n\nAnd every so often, someone will walk in who’s young, strong, and eager. Don’t get excited and overreach. You still start where they are. You still find something they can do, and progress it. That’s still the job.\n\n**Learn to make training apt.**\n\n*“I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it.”* — Pablo Picasso\n\n“Scaling” is the technical term, but I prefer apt. Training must be apt—suited to the person, their goals, and where they are right now. Not optimal. Not impressive. Apt.\n\nJen is 35, her last exercise was running to the 5am opening of the Myer Boxing Day sale, she is overweight, and has a knee reconstruction she forgot to mention in her PAR-Q and which you only find out about when you ask why her knees sound like rice bubbles and she winces when she squats. Jen does not need Tabata front squats. On the other hand, Jen is not dead yet, so she can and should do single leg press, and do more weight and reps over time. Apt. \n\nA squat might start as “sit and stand from a chair with help.” It might end up as “3x5 at 100kg.” Same movement, same muscles, same purpose. But radically different people. Apt training means you find what they can do and progress something: reps, sets, range of motion, load, technical difficulty, elegance.  \n\nEvery client, every time. Make the training apt, and keep it progressing. That’s how you build training intuition. That’s how you change lives.\n\n**Keep a log.**\n\n*\"You can observe a lot just by watching.\"* \\- Yogi Berra\n\nWrite down every session. What your clients did, what worked, what didn’t, how they felt, what they said. This is your apprenticeship journal. This is how you notice patterns. This is how you improve.\n\nFilm their lifts. Show them. “See where your knees drifted in? See how when I said, ‘knees out’ it looks better?” Or, “I know that felt hard, but look at this bar speed!” Film their first session, then show it to them again three months later. Anyone can rattle off numbers, but seeing how the quality of movement has changed will be persuasive and motivating.\n\nWorkouts should be written down, not stored on a phone. Everyone’s on their phones these days. Be different. I've had clients who went away and came back after two years. I could whip out their old journals and start them again, right where we left off. This makes a different impression to firing up an app. \"He *remembers* me.\" \n\n**Shut up and watch.**\n\n*“Listen. Or your tongue will make you deaf.”* — Native American proverb\n\nMost new trainers talk too much. Cue less, observe more. If a client’s struggling, figure out why before you jump in with solutions. Let them move. Let them fail a little. Then fix it.\n\nDon’t leap in with any cue before you figure out what's happening. You’re not guessing. You’re watching. Your eye is your most valuable coaching tool. Develop it. Use it. \n\nKeep the cues simple. \"I'd like to see good thoracic and lumbar extension\" is true and correct, but not helpful when they've got 100kg on their back. \"BIG breath in, chest UP!\" is better, especially if you can project your voice (not shout, project, try a drama class).\n\nThe fewer words you use, the more they hear. The quieter you are, the more they pay attention when you speak.\n\n**Learn from the old dogs - but verify.**\n\n*“Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue.”* — Proverbs 17:28\n\nSome veteran trainers are brilliant. Some are just bitter and stuck in 1998. Don’t take advice at face value. Try it. Watch results. Keep what works. Ditch the rest.\n\nMost especially, ignore the gurus. I ghost-wrote a fitness book for one of them once (NDA applies), he knew less than I do and doesn't train anyone anyway. The gurus aren't experts, they're politicians, they had some expertise, but became prestigious through being good at shaking hands, or saying something controversial in a funny way, or telling stories like the loveable old drunken uncle. They don't train anyone, it's like a divorcee becoming a marriage counsellor. \n\n**Get strong. Stay useful.**\n\n*“If you would be strong, conquer yourself.”* — Aristotle\n\nYou don’t have to be jacked. But you should look like you train. You should be able to demo a good squat, press, hinge, and carry. You should walk the floor with confidence. That doesn’t mean ego. It means competence. Nobody cares how much you lift, only one potential client ever asked me and he showed up to the gym as 95kg of man shovelled into 75kg of lycra and wearing his clip shoes, and proceeded to critique a woman's squat on her first day—and he was unable to perform a squat.\n\nBut people do care if you train or not. One of the things about any workplace is once you've finished work you want to get out of there. This makes training difficult. So probably you need to keep having a trainer or coach, keep you in the game. Better for your physical and mental health, and clients know when you're feeling up or down. \n\n**Don’t quit before year two.**\n\n*“Success is going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.”* — Winston Churchill\n\nThe first 6-12 months are horrendous chaos. Clients ghost you. Sales fall through. The churn is huge. I once spent three weeks buttering up a potential client and she ended up doing one session and never coming to the gym again. You doubt yourself. You burn out. That’s normal. Keep showing up. Keep being useful. After 18 months, you’ll look around and half your mates from the fitness course will be gone. And you’ll be doing just fine.\n\nThat’s the real cert: surviving the first two years.\n\n*Personal. Trainer. Both matter.*",

    "text": "I am a retired personal trainer. I work out at a large commercial gym near me. There is a young male trainer who has \"worked\" there for years and is terrible. However, so far, I've only seen him work with adults, and if they want a trainer who runs into the gym late with uncombed hair, who can't put his phone down for more than 2 seconds, and totally ignores them, so be it. \n\nBut twice now, I've seen him training a young boy who is probably about 13. And I don't see an adult there with the child. Probably a home-schooled child who gets dropped off at the gym while his mom runs to the store or something. \n\nToday, he set the child up on a lat pulldown and took off to talk to a cute young lady for AT LEAST 10 minutes across the gym. The poor kid had no idea what he was doing. The trainer wears a wedding ring, but that's besides the point. \n\nThen, after leaving this kid for a solid 10 minutes, he comes back and sets him up with some bicep curls and then follows the girl upstairs to a totally part of the gym, never to return. \n\nThe kid gets done with his bicep curls and goes looking for the trainer (by this time, I'm following the kid).  He can't find the trainer, so he just picks up his stuff and walks out the gym door. \n\nI really want to talk to the manager or at least tell the child to tell his parents. But I also don't want to be a \"Karen\". Should I mind my own business or tattle on this POS?",

That’s a pretty incredible way to earn a living.\n\nWe're helping people avoid illness, reduce stress, build muscle, gain confidence and ultimately become more energized, active, healthy (and yes, sexy) versions of themselves. That alone is fulfilling as hell.\n\nBut on top of that, the lifestyle is unreal. We’re not chained to a desk. We get flexibility and autonomy that most jobs just don’t offer. Want to work mornings only? Take mid-day off? Train clients online from anywhere in the world? Build your own brand or work in a gym setting? Indoors, outdoors, solo or with a team, you can design this career to fit your life. I’ve never felt more in control of my time or more aligned with how I want to live.\n\nThen there’s the *social* side of it. Honestly, it’s one of the best parts. You meet so many different people: clients, other trainers, gym members and you build strong, genuine relationships. You end up becoming part coach, part mentor, part therapist, and sometimes even a close friend. You watch people grow over time, not just physically but mentally and emotionally too. You get to be a positive part of their day, and they become a positive part of yours.\n\nOf course, this job has its challenges like anything else, early mornings, occasional cancellations, building a client base, but I think we sometimes forget how lucky we are. We get to work on ourselves while helping others, stay active, connect with great people, and make a real difference.\n\nTLDR: What we do matters, and it’s pretty damn special.",

    "text": "Hey r/personaltraining community,\n\r\nI hope everyone had a good holiday season and happy new year! I am back with a quick update on the Functional Fitness Exercise Database – it is a free resource to help keep your strength training exercises organized and quickly accessed in an easy-to-use spreadsheet for your workouts (https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/cvI4jUYMcv).

All exercises requiring you to move, stabilize, and develop functional and pain free strength.\n\r\nIn this version 2.4 update, I have added the following to the exercise database:\n\r\n-\tAdded 48 new reverse lunge variations.\r\n-\tAdded 11 new single arm macebell order exercises.\r\n-\tAdded 4 new push up variations.\r\n-\tAdded 3 new march variations.\r\n-\tAdded 3 new barbell overhead tricep extension variations.\r\n-\tAdded 3 new superband exercises.\r\n-\tAdded 3 other macebell exercises.\r\n-\tAdded 2 new pallof press variations.\r\n-\tAdded 18 other miscellaneous exercises.\r\n-\tReplaced broken video explanation links.\r\n-\tChanged pallof press from a frontal plane exercise to transverse plane.\r\n-\tChanged skin the cat variations to a rotational exercise.\r\n-\tChanged front swing to 360 variations to inside circle to 360.\r\n-\tChanged superband assisted dips to a tricep exercise.\n\r\nEnjoy the updated exercise database and feel free to follow along on twitter to stay up to date with the latest version (https://twitter.com/strength2o).\n\r\nYouTube Tutorial Video:\n\r\nhttps://youtu.be/9jW0il570Wg?si=DqA-i5hoko3sCSPz \n\r\nDownload Free Copy MS Excel / Google Sheets (best viewed on tablet/laptop or PC): \n\r\nhttps://strengthtoovercome.com/functional-fitness-exercise-database\r\n\r\n",

    "title": "Your clients are not the problem",
    "text": "This is a reflection after seeing the post: “Do you ever wonder how some of your clients function throughout the day?”\n\nThat post is the perfect example of what’s wrong with our industry and how ignorant many providers are.\n\nFirst, my humble brag so you understand my take better: \nI spent close to a decade in the Army as a combat unit officer, then nearly a decade running two of my own fitness studios. I hold myself to higher standards than most, and I believe in leadership principles - before and beyond anything else.\n\nI would never tolerate someone in my team and hardly in the industry who throws away responsibility and blames the client for something they were never expected to understand.\n\nIf you ever wonder how your clients function, that’s not a story about them - that’s a story about you. And it’s the least a shameful one.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\n&gt; Most people don’t come to exercise for exercise itself.\nThey come for the outcomes the industry promised: less fat, more muscle, energy, confidence, looking and feeling better. \nThey don’t care about exercise selection, equipment, or technique the way we do.\n\n&gt; They invest the minimum energy to progress.\nYou may have been excited at age 15, 20, or 25 to figure this out - scrolling social media, watching YouTube, ordering books.\nThe financial manager coming to you for better health does the same - for finance. The young mom’s life is filled with her children, not your assumption that\n“It’s not so hard to remember the name and setting of one exercise.”\n\nNow here’s the tough truth:\n&gt; The same expectations you hold for your clients are the ones you’re not fulfilling in your own business.\n&gt; If you wonder how they function, chances are you have no clarity on your service or who you should be signing up.\n\nTake 5 steps back.\nDo your homework.\nBuild an intake process that brings in people who align with your values, not those who leave you mentally taxed.\n\nThis is the biggest failure in our industry: \nWe expect people to meet us where we are, but the real job of a trainer, coach, or any provider is to meet people where they are.\n\nIf clients only needed us for reps and sets, YouTube and AI have that covered - you’d be out of a job.\n\nPeople need us because they don’t know how to do this alone.\nJust signing up won’t make them more excited or more capable.\n\nEver notice how clients don’t say:\n“I’m unfit because I never trained 3x/week with a trainer.”\n“I’m unhealthy because I never learned what an incline press is.”\n\nBut they do say:\n“I don’t have time.”\n“I don’t know what to do.”\n“It feels complicated.”\n“I always give up too early.”\n\nIf you expect clients to know exercise selection after 3 months and they don’t - that’s not on them. That’s a reflection of you and your service.\n\nChange what needs to be changed:\n- Improve your service delivery\n- Fix your intake process\n- Clarify your messaging, so people who care about exercise details can find you - and those who don’t won’t.\n\nIf you believe, like I do, that we have more valuable work to do for people,\nstart by looking in the mirror and committing to never sh*t-talk your clients again.\n\nTake responsibility first and always.\nThen go out and improve your services.",

    "title": "Client passed out today, feeling kinda down on myself",
    "text": "I should say “potential client” because it was his trial session with me. \n\nGuy comes in for his trial session/eval at a gym I rent space at. We chat about his work, his home life, his family, etc. Feel a good vibe with him, start to build rapport.\n\nI ask him about his workout history, and he says he walks/runs on the treadmill - walks for a mile or two at incline and then runs for a bit too. But wants to do more with weights. I tell him that I can certainly help him as a CSCS!\nHe also mentions that he has high blood pressure, and might need a CPAP soon and wants to workout more to avoid being slowed down by those things. (Edit: he presented these as if they were eventualities that he wants to avoid, and that they weren’t necessarily problems right now). I take note and rule out a fast-paced workout for the day, and ask that he be really good about letting me know how he’s feeling, and he’s says great! I also mention that I’m a positive affirmation trainer, not a drill Sargent. He says that’s great! I had him sign my waiver really quick too.\n\nWe move through some squats (some assisted with TRX), overhead press, TRX standing rows, and some Russian twists - all done with light weight, and he agreed it was light by saying “yeah, I can feel it, but I also feel I could do more”. All the while I’m letting him rest 1-1.5 mins between sets, and we are NOT moving fast (took 45 mins to do the whole thing). All the while I’m reminding him to breathe and to rest between exercises.\n\nFor the last Russian twist, he pressed really hard to finish the last set (which I suspect is what cause him to eventually pass out - valsalva maneuver that left him winded). But he looked just fine! So I said “nice going! Way to push yourself” and he said “thanks, I feel great!”\n\nWe head back upstairs to the sitting area, and we start going over plans and prices, and he’s perfectly coherent - and saying things like “I want to feel like this every time I workout!”\n\nThen he suddenly feels woozy, says he’s seeing spots, and then starts upchucking. I grab a trash can, he barfs, and then falls out of his chair knocking over the trash can. He’s like 6 foot 4, and I’m 5 foot 8, so I do everything I can to make sure he doesn’t hit his head as we lay him supine. He lands on his finger too and probably sprained it a bit… I go into laser-focus mode, and point to a woman and say “call 911” and turn to him and say “hey (name) can you hear me?” And I’m about to start compressions (edit: starting with checking his breathing) right before his eyes snap open and he says “no I’m good! I feel much better after throwing up!” And sits up, and starts talking! Saying “I’m good I’m good, wow that’s embarrassing.”\n\nSo me and a few sweet gym goers help me get him into the comfy couch nearby. I tell him not to move as I get him more water. He says “yeah, I didn’t sleep very well all week, and didn’t eat at all today!”\nSo I bought him a protein bar and got him more water. I sat with him and chatted with him until he finished, and then a little longer. Perfectly coherent. Eventually I have him stand - he’s good, back to normal. But wanting to be sure I walked with him to the bathroom, then walked him to his car, then chat with him once he got home, and again an hour after that - all to make sure.\n\nHe’s embarrassed and said he understood if I didn’t want to train with him. He’s saying things like “if you’ll have me I still want to train with you!” And I’m like shocked by that tbh. I told him to double check with his doctor first, but id love to train with him, but we will have to be watch out.\n\nBut I’m pretty embarrassed, for obvious reasons. He was a decent guy under my care and he passed out in a decently dramatic way. I did all the things to avoid liability - didn’t admit guilt, or anything. But that’s not what I care about, ya know? I didn’t get into this for the money, I do it to help people, and I’m feeling like I failed today. I did a lot of things right, but still feel like I could’ve done more.\n\nAnyway, that’s my venting.",

    "text": "My fellow professionals and shitposters, this one is for the aspirants today.\n\nBeen around the block over the last 14 years, learned some things, some things I wish I knew a bit better when I started, and today I want to dole some of that out to the aspiring among us.\n\n&gt;***Being a personal trainer is the best job I've ever had.***\n\n&gt;***But the best job I've ever had is still a job.***\n\nI started out in a luxury facility with healthcare and benefits, a 70% revenue split, got my schedule filled 100% in about 3 months, and found kind and generous mentors who were willing to help me screw my head on straight.\n\nI got lucky, and I don't try to fool myself otherwise because I know I'm not special and that this is pretty far from the average experience.\n\nMaybe you'll get lucky too, I hope so, but remember ...\n\n&gt;***The rarity of the exceptions, proves the rule.***\n\nSo, aspirant, you want to be a personal trainer.\n\nNot an easy feat in 2025, especially if you want to go the distance, have some fun while you're at it, collect buckets of those *crisp-hundred-dollar-bills™,* or much less pay your bills.\n\n&gt;**1. 80% of** **personal trainers exit the industry before their two-year mark.**\n\nAnd it's not uncommon to meet trainers who have been in the trenches far longer caught in a constant struggle to keep paying the bills, working 12-hour split shifts, and can't remember the last time they took a vacation.\n\nBecause ...\n\n&gt;**2. Your base certification will not adequately prepare you for the difficulties you’ll face in coaching clients.**\n\nMaybe you’ve experienced an awesome body transformation of your own, and with a freshly minted certification, you're ready to help others do the same.\n\nBut coaching is a huge skill, and real skill takes time to develop.\n\nEven the best certification or exercise science degree will leave you with numerous skill gaps, and filling those gaps may require years of practical experience to competently meet the broad range of needs of your clients.\n\nAt best, expect your certification to educate you on how to not harm the people you work with.\n\nYou're going to need mentors, time in the trenches, and fostering a love for sponging knowledge to shore up the vast tool set of a skilled coach.\n\n&gt;**3. Zero clients = zero income.**\n\nPerhaps you'll start your career in a large corporate gym and be paid a small stipend until you establish your clientele, maybe you'll even be on a salary, but most often you will be paid primarily on commission.\n\nZero clients means zero income. As a general rule, if you work in a facility that reliably feeds you clients to work with, expect to be paid less than your peers who have to source their own clientele.\n\n&gt;**4. You may have to work two jobs.**\n\nIncome in the world of personal training can be seasonal and sporadic, so plan accordingly with savings and supplemental income until you establish yourself.\n\nExpect your income to fluctuate with the seasons as your clients take vacations and holidays, remember that zero sessions often means zero income.\n\nDon’t quit your day job until you’re financially ready.\n\n&gt;**5. You are, first and foremost, a salesperson**.\n\nEvery day you will be required to sell people on your services, their goals, and continuing their relationship with you.\n\nTrainers that fail to become skilled in the psychology of sales and human nature, are the first to exit the industry.\n\n&gt;**6. When turning your passion into a career, the motivation reward for your passion will change.**\n\nThe best job you’ll ever have is still a job.\n\nWhen turning your passion into your job, you’re altering the intrinsic reward you receive from it.\n\nNo passion remains one for long when you find yourself working long hours, with difficult clients, and unable to pay the bills.\n\nTrainers who rely on their passion for fitness will be the ones who are the most cynical and bitter when forced to exit the industry for failing to make a living wage.\n\nThe trainers who go the distance are often the ones who are passionate about coaching, helping others, sponging and applying knowledge, and being a leader in their community.\n\n&gt;**7. Your schedule is no longer your own.**\n\nYou will have to train people around their schedule, not yours.\n\nIt's not unusual for a trainer in their first year or two to train 6am-9am, 11am-1pm, and 5-9pm, Monday through Friday, weekend mornings, and with significant unpaid time between sessions.\n\nDeeper into your career once you’ve established your reputation and clientele, will you be able to be more selective with who you train and when.\n\n&gt;**8. You work in the people business, and people can be very difficult to work with.**\n\nYou may have the best fitness theories and strategies the industry has to offer, but you'll quickly find that people are by and large, emotional and irrational creatures.\n\nHumans constantly act against their own best interests, fail to adopt even the simplest of new habits, and prioritize their short-term desires over their long-term needs.\n\nTo help your clients reach their goals and keep coming back for more, your expertise will have to be combined with a deep understanding of human nature.\n\n&gt;**9. Personal trainers serve the role of a friend, confidante, and amateur therapist.**\n\nYour clients will bring the harsh realities of their lives to your sessions.\n\nAs you become skilled in rapport and human nature, it will be your job to listen, understand, empathize, and at times offer your perspective and advice.\n\nLife can be harsh, your job will be to make it less so for others.\n\n&gt;**10. It is difficult to be a personal trainer, and even more difficult to be a strength coach, athletic trainer or tactical trainer.**\n\nThe market for athletic or military-style training is only a fraction of the overall market, far smaller than working with the everyday guy and gal, what we call the general population or gen pop.\n\nWhen choosing your demographic, think carefully about supply and demand, and product market fit.\n\n&gt;**11. Supplemental certifications and “coaching for personal trainers” is a profitable industry that won’t always lead to increasing your income.**\n\nYou'll be bombarded with certifications and coaches-coaching-coaches programs to increase your sales and skills by providing you with “*the right answer*.”\n\nBe selective with the ones you choose to invest in, as most will fail to generate a positive return on investment from simply going out and applying what you already know.\n\nTrainers who fail to grasp this reality too often find themselves exiting the industry with multiple certifications under their belt, with little to show for it.\n\n&gt;**12. Many gyms/facilities will not provide you with healthcare, paid time off, or a retirement vehicle. Plan accordingly.**\n\nGyms have tremendous overhead due to their real estate, maintenance, and staffing costs, and very few can offer competitive benefits that you would find elsewhere in the private sector.\n\nMany personal trainers are categorized as part-time employees or independent contractors to reduce labor costs.\n\nFull-time positions with competitive benefits do exist, but they can be few and far between.\n\n&gt;**13. People only have so much money to spend on coaching, and it varies by a lot.**\n\nTake the cost of the membership of your facility, add a zero to it, and you have a rough number that you can reasonably expect the average gym member to spend on personal training each month.\n\nYour experience being a personal trainer in Planet Fitness with a $15/mo membership price will be a vastly different experience than performing personal training in a $250/mo boujee luxury club with leather seats in the locker room.\n\nThis is going to have a profound effect on how many clients you may need to work with, how often each week, the hours you are forced to work with them, and how difficult it may be to sell the idea of personal training.\n\nTraining a smaller base of clients 2-3 times a week will be a much different experience than training a large base of clients once a week, or every other week.\n\n\\--\n\n# # In Closing\n\n\\--\n\n&gt;***Being a personal trainer is the best job I've ever had.***\n\n&gt;***But the best job I've ever had is still a job.***\n\nI don't share any of this to dissuade you from joining our ranks.\n\nThe opposite, actually.\n\nBecause I know when people jump into one of the most rewarding careers the market has to offer, knowing the risks with eyes wide open, well ...\n\nThey tend to go the distance and become the best among us.\n\nSo train hard, study hard, and sponge that sweet sweet hard-earned knowledge from the vets walking the locker room of r/personaltraining\n\n\\--\n\nAnd to the pros, what's something you wish you knew when you started.\n\nWhat do you tell the newbies when they say they want to be a trainer.\n\nWhat's something you wish you could go back and tell yourself, I want to hear that in the comments.",

    "title": "Some things I have Learned from 15-Years of Coaching",
    "text": "Hello All,\n\nRecently, I seem to be getting more and more DMs and Emails with trainers and coaches who are looking for advice. They always have the same set of questions, primarily: “How do I get more clients.” This is most likely because we are currently in the busy season for most gym/coaches, but it seems that all these people have the same key issues once we dig into it a bit more. What I have done here is collect what I tell these people based on what I have learned during my 15 years of experience as a coach who makes a very comfortable income in the industry. An email exchange takes far more time on my end and can only really help one person. Hopefully this can help more.\n\nAlso, it’s probably important to let people know before they dig into reading this that I don’t view coaching as some shallow practice or side hustle. I am highly serious about the practice of coaching and everything involved with it. This means that the advice I have to give, or at least the most important advice, probably won’t be very useful to those who view coaching as something far more casual or as a simple job. Because of this I get very technical and nuanced about its practice. This will probably make me, and the things I write, fairly insufferable to plenty of people. Also, this post started out fairly casual and became much more technical as I continued around line item 3 or so. I could go back and rewrite or edit it down, but I think that would be a disservice to some people. So, I’m just going to leave it the way it is.\n\nAnyway, hope it helps.\n\n# 1. You must have a solid identity as a coach.\n\nThis is foundational to everything that comes next. You will hear plenty of coaches go on and on about making sure you have a niche in the industry to the point that it has pretty much just become an empty talking point that is then followed up by zero information on what a niche truly is and how to find one for yourself.\n\nA niche is simply a well-fleshed-out category of potential clientele. Great, but how does that really help you? Which niche do you choose? How do you flesh out a category of clientele once you do?\n\nThis really all comes down to your identity as a coach because we don’t find niches, we create them based on who we are. Who are you? Are you a 50-year-old male bodybuilder who focuses on old school training and nutrition? Are you a 25-year-old woman who focuses on primal nutrition and combining yoga and meditation with resistance training? Are you a 30-year-old guy who focuses on looks-maxing and optimizing for a party lifestyle? Are you a 35-year-old woman who focuses on pre- and post-partum training and nutrition for new moms with careers?\n\nThink of identity like your personal brand but it runs deeper than that.\n\nThe worst thing you can say at this point is “I’m a coach who focuses on fat loss and muscle gain.” Imagine if someone referred you to a mechanic and when you asked what made that mechanic special they said, “He focuses on fixing cars.” I sure as hell hope he fucking does. Can you imagine a mechanic who didn’t focus on fixing cars? How successful do you think that mechanic would be? Can you imagine meeting a coach who doesn’t focus on fat loss and muscle gain?  How successful do you think that coach would be?\n\nEveryone that I described above focuses on fat loss and muscle gain. They just focus on that for a very specific clientele and approach it in a specific way. Simply focusing on the same thing that everyone else focuses on without any kind of specificity makes you a commodity level coach and means that any other coach who has just the smallest amount of specificity will always be a more attractive and better choice for a potential client. It also makes marketing yourself one of the most difficult things you can possibly do because marketing as a coach is almost always persuading the potential client about why they should choose you and not someone else. When you are almost identical to a couple of thousand other people out there, and therefore interchangeable, this will often come down to who is perceived as more likable and even then, those most likeable people are going to have a very hard or even impossible time competing with those who have a true identity in the industry even if they are less likeable.\n\nBeing a commodity level coach is a loser’s game. You really need to have a well-fleshed-out identity, a description of an ideal client, a mission statement, and code of conduct. This is really the bare minimum for knowing who you are as a coach. Once we know our identity, its time to focus on information.\n\n# 2. We don’t sell special, secret or general information. We sell pertinent information.\n\nAs coaches we have to eliminate the idea that we hold some kind of secret or special information that we have to offer the client. Fitness is a simple system of inputs (actions) and outputs (results) that we need to discover how to implement and realize while understanding that the human element is the most important and most difficult part of our job. Stop focusing on simple information. This may surprise a lot of people since coaches are essentially skilled knowledge workers and information is essentially what we sell. Coaching is an information game, but the internet has destroyed the ability to sell simple and general fitness information. Someone is likely much better at providing information in a digestible way than you are and is most likely providing it for free somewhere. You have to provide information in a way that allows a client or customer to implement inputs and realize outputs.\n\nWhat we really should be focusing on selling is specific information delivered in a way that provides:\n\n1. Expediency\n2. Simplicity\n3. Personalization\n4. Feedback\n\n“How can I provide these people with specific information more quickly, more simply, in a more personalized way, and provide feedback?”\n\nThis is really what you should ask yourself whenever you have an idea for any kind of product or service. But first you need to ask:\n\n“But how do I know **what specific information** to deliver more quickly, more simply, in a more personalized way, and provide feedback on?”\n\nThis all comes back to your identity and the niche that your identity matches up with. If you still don’t know what that is, you really should start focusing on it. Once you know your identity and your niche, simply provide them with value.\n\n# 3. You must provide value.\n\nValue is a word, much like niche, that has become fairly meaningless in business, including business in the fitness industry. Here is a fairly comprehensive description of the things that affect/provide value to a potential customer or client:\n\n**1 Alignment with Abstract Outcomes:**\n\nThis is how closely a product or service aligns with the unseen and often unexpressed outcomes that a client or customer desires. This is the most difficult metric to manipulate. Often this is something that takes much longer to develop and requires a coach to be very specific in their niche and messaging which allows potential customers and clients to identify us with their abstract outcomes. This is because different abstract outcomes will be more or less valuable to a given niche market and especially a given individual based on their desired outcomes and current internal discomforts. This is really how well a brand can cohere with the identity of a customer. The more closely a product, and more importantly a brand, can align with a niche market or an individual’s abstract outcomes the more valuable it will be to that niche market or individual.\n\n**2. Magnitude of Concrete Outcomes:**\n\nConcrete outcomes are the outcomes that are seen and most often directly expressed by a client or customer. Not all concrete outcomes are created equal. Losing ten pounds for summer and getting stage lean for a professional physique competition are two vastly different outcomes even though they exist along the same spectrum of weight loss. Helping someone lose ten pounds is a less valuable outcome than getting someone stage ready for a physique competition in general. Teaching someone to make $10,000 is less valuable than teaching someone to make $100,000 in general. The greater the magnitude of the concrete outcome, the higher the value of the product or service.\n\n**3. Alignment with Concrete Outcomes:**\n\nJust like abstract outcomes, there needs to be an alignment with Concrete Outcomes. Losing ten pounds is more valuable to a general weight loss client than getting stage ready is but losing ten pounds is also far less valuable to a physique competitor than it is to a general weight loss client. Helping someone make $10,000 in their market is far more valuable than teaching them to make $100,000 in a market which they don’t participate. The more aligned a concrete outcome is to the desires of the customer, the more valuable a product or service is.\n\n**4. Perceived Likelihood of Reaching Outcomes:**\n\nThis is how likely a customer believes that purchasing a product or service will be to help them reach both their desired abstract and concrete outcomes. The greater the perceived likelihood of achieving an outcome, the more valuable the product or service is.\n\n**5. Actual Likelihood of Reaching Outcomes:**\n\nThis is how likely a product or service will actually result in a customer reaching their desired abstract or concrete outcome. Keep in mind that we have the most control over concrete outcomes. Unfortunately, perceived and actual likelihood of reaching outcomes aren’t always aligned. Still, the more capable a product or service is at reaching a desired outcome, the more valuable a product or service is.\n\n**6. The Amount of Time Required to Reach Outcomes:**\n\nThis is the delay between purchasing a product or service and reaching a desired outcome. Speed is an incredibly important metric when creating value. Reaching a goal physique in 24-weeks is more valuable than reaching it in two years. The quicker an outcome can be reached, the more valuable a product or service is.\n\n**7. The Amount of Effort Required to Reach Outcomes:**\n\nThis is the amount of work a customer is going to have to do after purchasing a product or service before they reach their desired outcome. Reaching a goal physique through a lower level of effort is more valuable than reaching a goal physique through a high level of effort. This is especially true if there is no difference between the amount of time required to see outcomes. The less work is required, the more valuable a product or service is.\n\n**8. The Amount of Sacrifice Required to Reach Outcomes:**\n\nThis is the amount of comfort a customer will have to give up after purchasing a product or service before they reach their desired outcome. Reaching your goal physique while being more comfortable is more valuable than reaching your goal physique while being more uncomfortable. This is especially true if there is no time difference between the amount of time required to see outcomes. The less comfort is required to be sacrificed, the more valuable a product or service is.\n\n**9. The Permanence of the Outcome Once it is Reached**\n\nThis can also be considered as how long the outcome lasts once it is reached. The longer an outcome lasts after the discontinuation of a service or the use of a product, the more valuable that service or product is. Keeping your goal physique once you reach it is more valuable than regressing once a service has been discontinued or a product has been consumed. Imagine how valuable an oil change would be if you were able to offer one that lasted the lifetime of the car? Far more valuable than the one that is required every 3,000 miles.\n\n# 4. To provide value you must solve problems.\n\nWhen looking at any of the metrics above, we simply need to identify the associated problems, break them down into their most basic components, brainstorm solutions, choose the best ones, and then fulfill those solutions.\n\nWhen expressed it seems simple but in practice it can be much more difficult. I wont go super deep into problem solving here as that could be its own post but I will talk about the two distinct kinds of problems we face when creating value. Closed-Ended and Open-Ended Problems.\n\n**Closed-Ended Problems** are those which have defined answers. There is one correct answer and reaching that answer is simply done through the application of a skill through an established process. You know exactly when you have the answer to these problems. These problems do not need to be applied to the real world to know if they are correct. Once these solutions are applied there is immediate feedback on the value of the solution. These are Left-Brain Problems. Mathematical problems are an example of Closed-End Problems.\n\n**Open-Ended Problems** are those which have undefined answers. There are often many correct answers but there is often only one most correct answer. There is often no established process by which to answer these questions. You may never know if you have the best answer to these problems, and you may never have the best answer to this problem. You only know if you have a better or worse answer than other available answers. These answers must be applied in the real world to see if they are correct. Often there is a significant time delay between the application of these solutions and the ability to recognize the value of the solution. These are Right-Brained Problems. Creative and Conceptual problems are examples of Opened-Ended Problems.\n\nPeople who solve Closed-End Problems are rewarded by how complex the problems they can solve and how fast they can solve those problems. The reward for solving these problems is highly predictable and linear. The reward for Closed-Ended Problems is most often monetary and immediate but is often less than the monetary reward for Open-Ended Problems. People who solve Closed-Ended problems are generally viewed as competent based on a case-by-case basis and based on their individual problem-solving efforts.\n\nPeople who solve Open-Ended Problems are rewarded not just by how complex the problem is and by how quickly they can solve them but also by how completely they can solve those problems and how easily and meaningfully those solutions can be applied. The reward for solving these problems is much more unpredictable and is often exponential relative to the other solutions available for these problems. The reward for Open-Ended is more than simply monetary and is often also highly intrinsic. The monetary reward for Open-Ended Problems can be much higher than those of Closed-Ended Problems but often is far from immediate. People who solve Open-Ended Problems are generally viewed as more competent based on the scope of their body of work and are evaluated based on the collective of other solutions that have been provided to the area of the problems in question.\n\nThe most competent providers of value who receive the greatest compensation for their efforts are those that can solve both kinds of problems at a very high level.\n\n# 5. To become good at solving problems, you should pursue Craft. To become great at solving problems, you must pursue Craft.\n\nIf I truly only could tell people, including my younger self, one thing, this is it. The problem is that even I likely wouldn’t be able to grasp it when I was a new coach. That’s not because the idea itself is so complex or especially esoteric. It’s because a person needs to experience it to truly get it. You have to buy into the process to be able to see all the benefits of it, and how it will go on to influence and inform every decision you make. Once you see it, you can’t unsee it and it will fundamentally change you and how you pursue coaching or anything else you choose to apply its principles.\n\nIf I were trying to explain it to myself, I would first describe Craft as:\n\n\"Craft is the disciplined pursuit of transforming ideational vision into tangible reality through the mastery of knowledge, skills, techniques, and focused consciousness. It is the deliberate process of bringing an inner conception to external manifestation.\"\n\nSee that sounds like some woo-woo bullshit and would likely go far over my head so I would continue to describe it in a highly logical and progressive manner that is highly related to what we have just spoken about:\n\n* You need to upgrade your knowledge. \n* Once you upgrade your knowledge you will be able to apply that knowledge. \n* Being highly competent at applying a specific set of knowledge is called a skill. \n* Practicing a skill is the transmutation of specific knowledge into something concrete. \n* Being highly competent at a skill means having the knowledge required to know what instruments are necessary to practice that skill. \n* An instrument by which we apply knowledge through our skills to create something concrete is called a tool. \n* Being able to direct our consciousness to determine where, when, how, and to what end our skills are applied is called focus. \n* The longer we are able to focus over a given period of time, the more productive we can be in producing something concrete.\n* The more productive we are, the more valuable each hour of hard work we complete becomes.\n* The application of valuable hours in the creation of something concrete in a specific discipline is called Craft.\n* Therefore, the acquisition of knowledge, application of skills, selection of tools, and deployment of focus, sustained over time to create something concrete in a specific discipline is called practicing a Craft.\n* A person who practices Craft is called a Craftsman.\n* An Amateur is an individual who desires to practice a Craft but has not yet taken the steps required to become serious about its practice. \n* A Hack is an individual who pretends to practice a Craft but does not genuinely engage in true Craftsmanship.\n* An Apprentice is a Craftsman who is currently acquiring the basic knowledge and skills required to practice a Craft and has a very limited ability to maintain focus and be productive.\n* A Journeymen is A Craftsman who has gained a working competency in the knowledge and skills required to practice a Craft and is now expanding their ability to maintain focus over longer periods to become more productive.\n* A Master is a Craftsman who has achieved a high level of competency in the knowledge and skills required to practice a Craft and possesses the ability to maintain a high level of focus over extended periods, resulting in exceptional productivity.\n* An Artisan is a Craftsman who has attained such an advanced level of knowledge and skill competency, along with the ability to deploy extreme amounts of focus, that the practice of the Craft itself becomes the primary purpose rather than productivity. They transcend the craft because their engagement is driven by the intrinsic value of the practice itself, not merely the outcomes it produces. This is the goal of any Craftsman and achieving it likely doesn’t exist in reality.\n\nAfter I had worked through this description of Craft, I would do everything possible to try and persuade myself to then engage in the pursuit of it. I would tell myself that there is extreme fulfillment, joy, and peace in its pursuit unlike anything else I have ever felt. I would tell myself that this is the turning point, the epiphany that changes everything moving forward.\n\nAll right then…\n\nI could keep on writing for a while, and I could probably add about 10 more line items here but honestly I’m running low on time and I think Craft is probably the climax and main idea that most people would see the greatest benefit from implementing in their own practice.\n\nAs always, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask, and feel free to send me a question over DM if you would like.\n\nHope this helps,\n\n\\-Coach Ryan",

    "text": "Hey all, been lurking on this subreddit for a while and want to share some advice I wish I had at the beginning of my career. I have been a Personal Trainer/ Fitness Manager/ Group coach/ Youth coach through my career and currently in my 3rd year operating my own gym. \n\n* Client growth\n   * Yes you have to \"grind\" with your word of mouth marketing, every client is a potential for 3 more. Focus on delivering EXCEPTIONAL service that is maintainable to you, confirm that service with your client, and ask bluntly for referrals. No need to pass on \"referral rewards\" if your service is strong. \n   * Pay for marketing when you're able. The cost of doing online marking can get high, find someone that knows the ins and outs, pay them. Return on investment in marketing is worth it. If you work for a big box, ignore this. \n* Losing Clients\n   * Clients will cancel, always. Plan for about 10% attrition each month, if you have a bigger loss than 10%, go back to what you are delivering as a service and find why your clients are leaving at an above normal rate. EDIT- You should aim to lose no less than 5%. Planning for 10% keeps you safe. \n   * In my career I have fired only about 3 clients. They either did not respect my time or were combative to the process of being coachable. It is rare, but necessary for you to maintain a stable client base. Get rid of your bad apples \n* Educate\n   * Your education does not stop at certification. Expand your knowledge, watch out for crappy certs that just take your money for no application to your buisness. If you pay for it, you should see a 3x return on your investment in learning. \n* Protect your Time\n   * You are a professional, act like it. Appointment times are agreed upon with minimum 48 hour notice, canceled in minimum 24 hours. if you arrive late, too bad. I have other things on my schedule, if we need a different time let's do it. \n   * Programming efficiency. Don't make it too complicated. Fitness doesn't need to be fancy for 99% of the population, stick to what works and rinse and repeat. Your job is to create consistency, so you should consistently program with a system that is easy to use and scalable to what you want to make. Currently I take about 30min a day to keep up with 40ish programs. \n\nAsk anything you like, im an open book and want to help new coaches grow. ",

    "title": "Guide for the newbie PT: clients, hours and getting drained",
    "text": "This came out of responding [to this thread,](https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/comments/1ka9a1s/whats_the_max_number_of_1on1_clients_you_could/) but got too lengthy, and could probably benefit would-be or newbie trainers.\n\nIn this post you will be taught about the factors influencing the number and kinds of clients you should train, and the number of hours you work. The reason you are taught this is so that you as an individual considering the personal training career, or starting out as a PT, can have a reasonable expectation of the way to handle things without burning out early. \n\n**Hours worked, and clients trained**\n\nMost personal trainers work part-time (less than 30hr pw) and have not more than 10 clients. Successful trainers will often have more, but not *hundreds* \\- what makes a trainer successful is less the total number of clients, and more that they have a low turnover of them. \"This job is sales!\" is true in part, but is most emphasised by people who aren't good at keeping clients. My trainer has a guy who he picked up as his client on his second day in the gym, and this guy is still with him seven years later. My trainer doesn't have to advertise, people come to him. \n\n**What limits numbers - hours available to clients**\n\n80% of sessions will happen 6-8am and 5-8pm, more or less. That's because most of the people who can pay for 1:1 PT themselves do some kind of 9-5 work (or 8-4, etc). \n\nThe other 20% are well-off students, retirees, and stay-at-home mothers with well-off husbands, and the occasional shift worker (but most shift workers working *changing* shifts, so they're not reliable clients). That's another hour during the day. \n\nFor most trainers, if you do 5 days a week then this puts you at a maximum of 30 hours a week of 1:1 PT. In practice it's more like 20-25 hours, since there'll always be gaps, with clients going away on holiday, being sick, simply not showing up etc, and of course you want little gaps here and there for yourself to take a break, or to slot in someone who usually does Mon/Wed 7:30am but this week wants Tue/Thu 9am, that sort of thing.\n\nObviously you can do more hours if you do split shifts. But then you're in the gym from 6am to 9pm with odd three hour breaks in the day and you get sick of the place and will never see your spouse or friends. So in practice most trainers do either mornings or evenings, with an hour or two spread in the middle of the day. \n\n**What limits numbers - hours per client**\n\nSo then the number of clients you have will depend on how much time each have. At the Y most people did 2x30' pw, so I built up to 20-24 clients. In some other gym it might be 1-3x 1hr pw, so then it's 10-12 clients. Now, dealing with 10-12 people is a lot easier than dealing with 20-24, but a higher number is more resilient. You're always going to get 1-3 people who are sick, go on holiday, change jobs, move house or whatever. If you've 10-12 people and lose 1-3, there goes something like a quarter of your income; if you've 20-24 and lose 1-3, it's no big deal. \n\nMost trainers who do full-time (30+) hours tend to do small group classes like boot camps or circuit classes, or large classes like yoga, pilates or spin, or do some gym floor work, or front desk work, or at the community gyms with swimming pools they might  also be a lifeguard, and so on. My own trainer does football coaching at a high school too. \n\nSo for example 30 hours could be\n\n* 10 clients @ 3x 1hr pw each \n* 30 clients @ 2x30' pw each \n* 15 clients @ 2x30' pw each PLUS 10 gym floor hours PLUS 5x 1hr spin classes\n\nBut of course you'd have to build up to that. Nobody gets 10 clients their first day in the gym. My first 2 years in the gym I trained 36 different people (just counting paid sessions, not free intros) at least once each, but 18 of them did 91% of the sessions. So basically 1.5 people started each month, and 0.75 people left. Nowadays it's more like 3-4 new people each year, and 1-2 leave (or more commonly, are fired). The churn diminishes as you become more experienced.\n\n**What energises and drains you - you** \n\nAs for getting drained, this depends on a number of things. The first is who you're training. To get and keep clients we need to **demonstrate competence, establish trust and build rapport.** \n\nWhen you're unsure of your own competence, not sure if they trust you, and don't have rapport, that's going to be more draining for you than if you're confident in your competence, if they obviously trust you, and you get along well. \n\nPersonal, trainer. Personal is establishing trust and building rapport, and trainer is demonstrating competence. At the start you're not very good at being a trainer, but you might be good at the personal if you're naturally emotionally intelligent, and/or have customer service experience of some kind. Interestingly, military experience helps - you're forced to work productively with people you don't even like. As an aside - you don't have to be extroverted. Susan Cain wrote a book called *Quiet - the Power of Introverts in a World That Won't Stop Talking* where she explained that introverts become extroverts when they're talking about a topic they're passionate about. If you're an introvert who's passionate about fitness, then you're effectively an extrovert in the gym - if you can find a willing listener. \n\nAs you become better at both personal and trainer, you become better at demonstrating competence, establishing trust and building rapport. You imagine that you'll get better at signing people up because you'll have demonstrated results with before/afters, but really that's not such a big factor as simply being better at demonstrating competence, establishing trust and building rapport. Becoming a better personal trainer. \n\nAs with everything, we can use the shit-suck-good-great scale. A *Shit* trainer is one who can do 0 out of the 3; a *Great* trainer 3/3. Unfortunately since this industry is dominated by part-time casual work and has a low barrier to entry, there's such a vast amount of competition that there's no room for you to be anything but *Great*. You have to **demonstrate competence, establish trust and build rapport**. Not with everyone, but with enough people to fill your schedule. That's maybe 20 people out of 2,400 gym members. You can manage it with 1% of the people you meet, surely?\n\n**What energises and drains you - good and bad clients**\n\nOn the client side, what we want for them is to be **likeable, reliable and hardworking.** Two out of three will do. One out of three will not. As with everything, we can use the shit-suck-good-great scale. \n\n* *Shit* client - *none* of likeable, reliable and hardworking. They annoy or bore you in some way personally, they don't show up regularly and on time, and they slack off during sessions. These almost never last or redeem themselves, and will of course never get results, and certainly never refer anyone to you. \n* *Suck* client - *one* of likeable, reliable and hardworking. Not good enough. Worst of all is the one who is not likeable, is lazy, but is very, very reliable. \"God, here he comes again... I wish he'd quit.\" They won't get results beyond what they could have got from going for a 30' walk and doing some lunges and pushups every day, and certainly won't ever refer anyone to you. \n* *Good* client - two out of three of likeable, reliable and hardworking. If they are likeable but reliable, you can put up with their being lazy; if they are likeable but unreliable, but work hard when they do show up, that's okay, too. And if you don't like them but they always show up and work hard, \"Okay this conversation is boring me, time to do an extra set.\" Good clients will get results - mediocre results, usually, but results nonetheless. These generate the most referrals. \n* *Great* client - likeable, reliable and hardworking. This is your star client who gets significant results and becomes your before and after pictures. Interestingly they don't get a lot of referrals - they're so reliable and hardworking they don't have much of a life outside the gym. \"I don't need friends, I've got my trainer and gym buddies!\" They don't know anyone they can refer you to.  \n\nThe *Shit* client will ruin your day, just one of them can fuck up your sessions and distract you, everyone else might be *Great* that day but you're still a miserable bastard afterwards, keep on like that and you'll end up losing a *Great* client. Bin the *Shit* clients ASAP. The *Suck* client, well it depends on how tolerant you are. But you can put up with them if the others are better. The *Good* client is your bread and butter, long-term this will be the majority. The *Great* client not only isn't draining, they actually energise you, you could train 10 in a row from 6am to 8pm with nothing but toilet breaks and you'd go bouncing home, make a delicious nutritious dinner and make passionate love with your spouse. \n\n**What drains us - code-switching**\n\nOne of the things that drains us is code-switching, changing how we behave - the term comes from people of an \"ethnic\" background learning to act Anglo to fit in, but it applies in lots of things, eg military vs civilian life, \"pass the fuckin' potatoes, those are as tasty as a motherfucker\" is fine in the army mess, but probably doesn't go down well with grandma. Obviously you'll speak differently to a 20yo gym bro than you would a 75yo woman on a walking frame. If you have several very different clients in a row, this is tiring. It's the same as is experienced in any customer service job like waitressing or retail or bank clerk or whatever. \n\nThis can be mitigated in two ways. The first is to find out who you work best with, and focus on them. When I was looking for a trainer earlier this year, I first enquired with a woman trainer at a gym, I liked her experience and background - turns out she doesn't take male clients. Obviously she's found she works best with women. That's fine. Just be aware that the more narrowly you define your demographic, the fewer people in it. One gender is half the population, which is plenty, but if it's \"30-35yo women who are stay-at-home mothers with a hobby of tennis\" then there won't be many. Still, if you only train people like you, there won't be much code-switching and you won't be drained. \n\nThe other way to minimise code-switching is to do small group - as I do. In my gym I've had the 20yo Anglo student studying primary teaching hanging out chatting with the 68yo semi-retired Bengali Indian engineer. Being a small group, everyone code-switches just a little bit, whereas with 1:1 you have to do it a lot. It's just a basic customer service skill, and one of the things you get better at as time goes on. But if you have a small group you don't have to do it as much, they do a lot of the personal work for you, and you can focus on the trainer part. \n\n**Money**\n\nAs an aside, obviously your income will relate to this. Think of what you want to earn, divide it by the hours you want to work, and that's what you need to charge. This may or may not be a reasonable hourly rate, or it may be reasonable for an experienced personal trainer but not for a newbie, or it may be alright if combined with other work, and so on. Things to think about. But this post is about hours and clients, money's another topic. \n\n**Example**\n\nAs an example, here was my weekly schedule working at the Y in 2013. The standard there was people doing 2x30' pw, though I had some 1x30' and a single 4x30' person (she did weights, and her own cardio right after). I had 15 clients doing a total of 15.5 hours of personal training, along with 8 hours of gym shifts, so it was 23.5 hours a week of work - but being physically present at the gym or its surrounds for 29 hours. I usually picked up 1-2 other 4-5hr gym shifts, too. This was a quieter time. \n\nI fairly commonly went and had scrambled eggs and salmon at a nearby cafe for breakfast at 0730, and I set aside Mon-Thu 0800-0830 as a workout time, I just did weights as I'd cycle 24km to work (took the train home). When you live in the gym, you do have to be fairly strict with yourself in setting a workout schedule - a lot of trainers end up not working out at all. I paid another trainer at the gym to train me (we got staff rates!)\n\nI deliberately limited my hours as I have a family, and at the time my son was a toddler. Had I wanted to, I could have worked Friday and Saturday too, adding 40% to my hours and income, or worked afternoons and evenings, adding probably 50% - or 100% if I was ambitious enough. \n\nAre there any final questions or doubtful points on the number and type of clients you should seek, and the hours worked?\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ou8lu713coxe1.png?width=1290&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5272586ab1c9054f3b73801727ad4845d1d9155d\n\n",

    "title": "Speed up Your Personal Training Journey",
    "text": "How’s it going? I’m SteroidGiraffe. I have been a Strength Coach (CSCS) / Personal trainer for 8 years now.\n\nI’m writing this for 3 reasons.  \n1. My goal is to be able to help at least 1 person with 1 piece of information to improve their beliefs towards personal training and how to be successful in the field.\n2. To share my own personal experience, beliefs, and knowledge \n3. Improve my writing\n\nI am no means an expert, but I do believe something I went through will help save another trainer time in the future. (As we know, time is everything when you're a personal trainer)\n\nI will go over my 10 biggest factors that have led to my success as a trainer(no particular order). With some more rambling at the end. This is for training the general population. Not athletes, bodybuilders, or anyone competing in a competition. This is for everyday Suzie and John, who want to live longer, feel better, lose some weight, and see their grandkids turn 18. \n\n1. **If you have no clients, give away free sessions**. \nThis is easier said than done, and one session is not enough. I promise that if you overdeliver on these free sessions, you’ll have more clients than you can handle. I have given away free months of training before. If you do not have any clients and you are not getting paid. You might as well sharpen your skills and not get paid.\nA wise man once said there is profit in all labor. \nWorst-case scenario with the free session or sessions, the person goes home and is not interested in continuing, not for them, whatever the reason is. When they go to a family gathering, you’re top of mind for anyone in their circle who's looking.\nGet your time in the trenches. Put in the hours. The certs and books teach you little. \n\n\n2. **Overestimating clients abilities**\nBefore I did PT, I worked in the college setting from D1-D3. My views may have been skewed, but when I first did my initial convo/consult, I always took the client's word on how well-trained they are. Well, news flash, most people like to overestimate what they are capable of doing or how well trained they are. This, unfortunately, has led to multiple clients becoming sick, nauseous, and dizzy. I now make a disclaimer after the initial consult of the first week or two will feel pretty easy. I then proceed to underestimate everything they are capable of. \nI like this approach because it allows the client to feel stronger and more confident. It’s a good feeling constantly having to up the intensity (Intensity being weight).\nIt will decrease any chance of injury. First week if you injure someone, good luck getting them to renew. Especially if it was because you pushed them too hard. \nIt also prevents failing and missed reps. A pet peeve of mine is failing/missing reps. There’s a time and place for it, but when you're starting with a new client, the first 6 months you are there for them to build confidence and improve movement quality (ability to recruit proper muscle fibers).  Missing reps and constantly having to lower the weight they are using does not improve confidence or movement quality. (I will almost always change the program before lowering the weight if they are stalling in a certain exercise).\nLastly, it’s easier to make form corrections with lighter weights than max efforts.\n\n\n3. **Being personable**\nI have not always been able to hold a conversation growing up. I was actually shy, awkward, and avoided social interaction at all costs. The best thing you can do is to relate and build rapport with your clients. This is done through body language and conversation, which shows you care about them. Always put them first (read Dale Carigane: How to Win Friends and Influence People; that’s what you are doing, influencing people to work out for the long term wether its with you or not) \nAll progress and results aside, you will get lifelong clients by just being able to talk to them and ask how their family is doing. You end up building a wonderful relationship with these people and learning more about them than their own family does, sometimes for better and worse. \nAnother big tip, though my internship at MBSC. Mike would always say No one cares how much you know until they know how much you care. This was worth every second of the internship. \nWe have all seen really bad trainers keep clients for a long time. This is because they act like they care and are personable. It’s personal training, so make it personal.\nIt helps to have a handful of fun questions in your back pocket. I know there are a handful of different card games out there that have these small talk questions. Memorize some of them. Say something, not nothing. \nTry not to be a therapist. Once that toothpaste is out, it’s not going back in the tube.\n\n\n4. **The majority of the general population only needs to work out 3 days a week for 45-60 minutes.** \nI will die on this hill. \nMost of the people paying for personal training are only paying to show up. My longest-term clients don’t need me. But if they didn’t pay for the session, they just wouldn’t work out. They know it is important for longevity and helps them feel good. \nAnother type of client truly has no clue what to do and needs guidance. These clients are great because it’s a clean slate, and you get to teach them. These sessions go by fast. They also challenge you the most on form correction ques and different ways to teach articulate.\nDon’t make it miserable and act like they need to be in 5-7 days a week. I don’t have a family of 4 kids with 2 dogs and both grandparents still alive, but I could see how that life for someone is very busy. \nA client consistently going 3 days a week from doing nothing will get some crazy results. ( I do always like to push walks on off days. Just about everyone feels better if they move for an hour each day. Most of the time this can be done walking the dog playing with the kids, going on a date with the SO. Just because I push it dosen’t mean it happens and I don’t make them feel like poop because they didn’t). \n\n\n5. **Great body comp changes are hard.**\nYou will rip through tons of clients who want to lose 20-30 pounds. You will be able to help them. Don’t get me wrong, you will make some life-changing results for some. But to consistently have clients come to you and lose 30-50+ lbs or ⅓ to ⅔ of their body fat percentage, you're doing something truly incredible. \nWhen people come in for body comp changes, it’s not just diet and nutrition; it’s a habit overhaul. Most people are too comfortable with their routine to make any noticeable changes, and if they do, the people they surround themselves with will almost always drag them back. Oh, Suzie lost 20 lbs in 3 months, but didn’t change her friend group and is now going out to dinners and drinking again. Boom back to where we started. Yo-yoing is not real; not making life a lifelong habit change is. \nSometimes clients who come in to lose weight end up staying forever, too! They may or may not lose what they want, but teaching them how to focus their goals to be the best mom or dad they can be while taking care of their health is a huge win. You have to remember that with the general population, they are doing this for their health. Doing something is always better than nothing. Most of them won't give up their weekend eating out and drinks. Heck, maybe over time, you plant a seed to have them start taking slow, actionable change, which tends to make long-term permanent change. \nYou will have some clients who think they want to lose 30-40lbs, and after 10-15, they are ranting and raving about how they feel and go back to their old habits or are just not as serious about losing weight. This is okay. Don’t push their weight loss on them if they are happy. You can use this time to help them build muscle more efficiently.\n\n\n6. **Build your own beliefs.** \nI know how ironic as I write this. But throughout your journey, you will come across more information than you know what to do with. Take the information that works for you and your clients and disregard the stuff that doesn’t.\nIf you are not happy with the situation, client load, or pay you are currently getting, it’s your beliefs that are holding you back. \n\n\n7. **Don’t act like you know it all and can cure everything.**\nPain and injury can stem from 1,000s of different avenues. You don’t need to fix people every time they come in and abandon the plan. You are also not a physical therapist. Make small adjustments so you don’t make anything worse, but a good majority of injuries and nags fix themselves. Ahh, achy knees, well, let’s keep strengthening the quads and hamstrings, and I can guarantee if it’s not a serious injury (some ligament tear, etc.), it will go away in a couple of months with consistent strength training. \nListening to your client is huge here. It’s almost like an art form. Is what they are saying what they actually mean? Did they just have a hard week from stress and can’t give you 100% today? You are not training Olympic athletes. Your goal is to get them to come back and back and back. Remember the thing about planting seeds.\n\n8. **Have your own training style.**\nYour vibe attracts your tribe. People want to train with you based on your looks (yes, your looks; looking good and fit makes you more trustworthy and believable, look up the halo effect) and how you work them out. You are not for everyone, I am not for everyone, and that is okay. Do I agree with all training styles and programming? No. You do not have to either. \nNothing will even beat the basics. Squat pattern, hinge pattern, vertical pull, horizontal pull, Horizontal Press, (vertical press if shoulders are okay). Large compound exercises. If they have something they want to focus on, then you can add that in at the end. I personally like to add at the beginning and the end. Doublé training. \nSuper setting muscle groups, especially agonist or opposite body part, is a great way to be super efficient in the gym, get more total volume it also helps with rest time and the awkward small talk in between (remember awkward). It can be tough if you're in a larger commercial gym.  \n\n\n9. **Don’t sell yourself short.**\nYou are worth $100 a session \nYou're worth the $10,000 yearly package up front. \nI find that a lot of trainers do not value themselves or their time. You set the prices. Charging anything less than $70-$120 MINIMUM per session in this climate is silly. But what if I lose clients? You don’t have to up all clients' prices right away. Get new clients within this range. Then come back to the old clients and ask if they are willing to pay more. If not, give them to a friend to train for the price they want. Once you start valuing your time, you become more valuable yourself.. (Also, clients who pay more get better results because they are more bought in.) (One of the best body comp gyms out there charges anywhere from $150-$450 a session. They get killer results. For every client you lose, you’ll get a new one that will pay double. Boom.\n20 hours a week at $100 an hour is 100k a year (before taxes). \n\n\n10. **Learn learn learn**\nEvery client and trainer you come across knows more than you about one subject. Heck, every person does. \nThe biggest thing that will hold anyone back from being successful in this field is thinking they are better than everyone. Or the classic, I know I'm better than Eddy, even though he works 35 1:1 hours a week. Might be better, but you're not desirable. Look inward and find out why. \nYour training style will change, you will try different methods, and at times, think this is the final evolution of your training. It never is, but do pay attention to what you keep coming back to. What tends to be the staples that clients get the most results with and are the easiest to comply with? \nFor me, it’s a full body A + B day that hits every muscle group 3x a week at a moderate intensity (alternating days when the clients come in. It also makes it so if a client misses a day, it doesn’t completely throw off the program. I just pick up where I left off.) I run these programs for 4 weeks before making slight adjustments. \nFor your own training, do every possible program out there. See what you like. Get rid of what you don’t like and keep adjusting. \nHot take: Instagram, YouTube, and forms are a fine place to get information, you just have to sift through the BS and attention-grabbing stuff some people post. \n\nPersonal training is difficult to build a career out of. Most people come into it as a stepping-stone job, in between. The two most common are out of high school/ college or a Midlife crisis from a desk job, and they are not sure what to do. You can take a weekend cert and start training people. If you can stick it out for more than 3-5 years, you will be paid well, and business will come easily to you.\n\nPlease let me know what you like or don't like. If you found this helpful or if there is anything you would like me to expand on. Thanks",

    "title": "some real things that helped me close more online fitness clients (without becoming better at sales lol)",
    "text": "Hey all. Just wanted to share some stuff that really helped me get more paying clients online, without needing to become a sales expert. i'm from sweden and run a fitness coaching business online since 2018. we’ve got over 22K customers, and most of that came from **sales calls** not ads or fancy funnels or anything like that.\n\nso yeah, i've done a lot of trial and error. and if you're a coach or trainer trying to grow, maybe some of this can help you too.\n\n**1. Offer \"pay later\" on calls**  \nthis one was a gamechanger. around 30-40% of our clients **don’t pay the same day** they book a call. but they *want* to start, they just don’t have the money right now. maybe they get salary in 10 days, maybe their card is maxed. whatever.\n\nso what we do: we send a special **payment link** that lets them sign up now but pay later (through Stripe or MoonClerk). we don’t say it’s a “trial”, we frame it like this:\n\n&gt;\n\nthis removes a big barrier for a lot of ppl. and we still count it as a closed sale.\n\n**tip:** you can also collect card info and charge later if your tool allows it, or set up an auto-pay that triggers in X days.\n\n**2. Use a short pre-sale video after someone books**  \nthis is **not** a VSL (video sales letter). this is just a quick video (3-5 min) that people see **after** they book a consult. the goal is to build trust before the call.\n\nwe include:\n\n* some client testimonials (or just simple screenshots if you're new)\n* what kind of clients we help\n* what results people typically get\n* a few ways to work with us (no price yet)\n\nmost trainers send nothing after a booking — just an email like “see you at 3pm”. but this video warms them up and makes them **more likely to show up** and **more likely to say yes**. especially if you're not super confident in your sales skills yet.\n\n**3. “ladder down” your offer**  \nthis is a sneaky one that helped us when people hesitated on the price. we always start by offering our **main program**, which is 6 months at like $200/mo.\n\nbut if they’re unsure, we *ladder down*. like:\n\n* offer 3 months instead of 6\n* or offer a lower monthly rate with fewer features\n* or give a one-time “you can start today for $100/mo instead of $200/mo” deal\n\nthe point is to have **levels** in your offer so you don’t lose people who *want to join* but just can’t swing the top tier.\n\n**4. send daily value emails after someone books**  \nthis sounds nerdy but it works. most of us only send reminders like “your call is tuesday at 1pm”. instead, we send an **email every day** for 5–7 days (depends when the call is).\n\nin the emails we include:\n\n* client stories\n* short value videos (like weight loss tips, stress management, etc)\n* what our coaching style is like\n* mindset shifts\n\nthe email doesn’t even mention the call. it’s just free content that builds trust and makes the client feel like they “know” us. and when people feel like they know you, they’re waaay more likely to buy.\n\n**pro tip:** this can be automated with Mailchimp, ActiveCampaign, or whatever CRM you use. Set it up once and it runs on its own.\n\n**5. cancel anytime offers (for new coaches especially)**  \nif you're new and struggling to close sales, let people **cancel anytime** for the first 30 days. you don't even need to offer money-back. just say:\n\n&gt;\n\nthis removes a lot of friction for ppl who are scared to commit. and in our experience, when they see results in the first few weeks, **most people stay**.\n\nover time you can switch to longer commitments. but this helped us big time early on when trust was harder to build.\n\n**bonus:** make sure you’re tracking your calls  \nwe use Notion and a Google Sheet to log:\n\n* show rate\n* close rate\n* common objections\n* which rep closed the sale\n\nthis helped us spot where things break down. like if show rate drops, we fix the reminders. if closing drops, we tweak the offer. treat it like a system and it gets easier over time.\n\nhope this helped a few of you out there. none of this stuff is about being a “sales closer” or whatever. it’s just making it easier for clients to say yes. and honestly, most people *want* to say yes, you just have to make it simple and low-pressure.\n\nlet me know if you wanna see examples or have questions. happy to help 🙌",

    "text": "And that is becoming a very good coach. \n\nThere are no shortcuts to long term success in this industry, and I see so often people asking questions in this sub looking to jump the line and find a cheat code. \n\nAt the end of the day, you will build a long term, financially successful, stable career as a coach ONLY if you develop yourself into a REALLY good coach. This should and does take years. Years of working hands on with a wide variety of clients. Years of learning from those who are more experienced than you are. Years of trial and error and continuing education, of sampling from other coaches, of analyzing your own coaching style and being fluid in how you work with your clients. You do not just get a certification, show up at a box gym for 3 months then become an expert in anything and you will never know all the answers. \"You will never arrive\". \n\nA flashy marketing plan might bring in new clients, but they will leave if you aren't a good coach. \n\n100,000 instagram followers and a stage ready physique may bring you new clients, but they will leave if you aren't a good coach. \n\nYou can invest thousands of dollars into sales mentorships and guru's who say they have the answer, all will be wasted if you aren't a good coach. \n\nThis is an industry based around working with human beings and their health. If you expect to come into it and be an expert right away, you're disrespecting the people you intend to work with. \n\nBe patient. I don't think there is a single successful coach, myself included, that truly felt they had a grip on things the first 4-5 years (yes thats a long time, it should take a long time). You don't need a niche on day 1, you don't need to coach online on day 1 (you will fail), you don't need expensive mentorship to learn the fundamentals, you just need to be patient and work hard. That is it.\n\nIf there was a magic pill, a proven shortcut, a time tested way to build a massive business in a short amount of time, EVERY coach in this sub including myself would be using it. But there is not. The people who are successful here and all around the industry are those who have spent a decade + accumulating knowledge and experience, continuously learning and being patient. \n\nThis is all common sense, but I felt it needed to be said based not he frequency I see people asking for a way around it. \n\nOnward, Always. \n\n",

    "text": "Hey everyone I have finished my first year of employment out of college as a trainer and the truth is I regret going full time.\nI graduated with a degree in exercise science got my ace cert and started training fresh out of college. I am grateful to stay at my parents where I don’t pay rent, if not I would be homeless. The hours are inconsistent and many people travel, you also do not get payed for the work outside of sessions. I love my job but I regret the way I went about it.\n\nTo anyone considering personal training I would recommend starting it to supplement another career, building a big consistent clientele then eventually going full time. I am doing okay now but without the support of my parents and girlfriend I would be in a bad situation. If anyone is considering becoming a trainer I recommend it, but do not drop everything to become a trainer full time unless you have financial support. Start part time until you can build a consistent clientele.",

    "text": "Almost 2 years ago I made a post about my career in personal training and how I made it to $198k in sales. This year I’m about to close out about $384k in sales. In my last post I spoke about what I found that worked and what didn’t. Since that time I have became an equity partner at the gym I work at. We opened our 4th location where I run my own company at  and manage. In 2024 I hired two trainers to contract under me. 2025, we grew to 7 trainers including me. I wanted to give an update since my last post was pretty popular especially amongst new trainers. These are a few things I have learned in the last 24 months:\n\nManaging people: no one will care about your business the way you do. Don’t expect them to.\n\nWork-life balance: at this point in my career it doesn’t exist. I’m working 7 days a week and most days it’s 12-14 hours of non stop work. I used to workout religiously 5-6 days a week and now I’m lucky if I get 2 workouts in a week.\n\nFamily life: I’m 34 and was fortunate to meet a woman I love and cherish who also works for the same company. Luckily she sees the end goal in all this (I hope) and understands why I’m not around that much.\n\nRealize what isn’t working: I planned the entire layout of this gym to operate a certain way. Within one month I realized it wasn’t working. I made adjustments, asked for feedback, and did what worked.\n\nFind a way to work for yourself: trainers work their asses off. You shouldn’t be giving away 50% of whatever you bring in. Become so good at what you do that people can’t deny you. Build relationships and genuinely care.\n\nMake the decision: after a decade in this career I realized you need to truly love it. I’m not an extrovert by default but you have to constantly be around people and selling yourself. There are easier ways to make money and still help people. This career can be very rewarding but if you don’t truly love it, it will show. Make sure there is an end goal in mind.\n\nThese are all the things I wish someone told me when I first started. I hope it helps.\n\nMy original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/personaltraining/s/twC99GukK9",

    "title": "I declined on a client that wanted to train with me. I'm new in this business and I'm curious if I could handled it better",
    "text": "Hi, I'm a new PT. I started this line of work 2 months ago. I studied a lot and feel confident about my knowledge of training. Although my sales skills are lacking for now, which is reflected in the number of clients I have (2 clients).\n\nA woman came in for a consultation with me today. I asked her some questions about her health, goals, typical day, and whether her life is stressful, etc. After that, she did some squats, glute bridges, push-ups, etc. — just some exercises to get a grasp of her condition.\n\nDuring the whole time, she talked a lot about her home situation. She has 2 kids, a job, is divorced, and currently in a 1-year relationship with a partner (not his kids, but they live together). Her partner has a job but doesn’t help around the house or with the kids. Basically, she takes care of the home and family alone and also works full-time. Because of that, she usually eats one meal a day and drinks a lot of coffee and energy drinks, and she smokes. She usually sleeps 5 hours a day, sometimes 7.\n\nBesides talking about her home situation, she also talked a lot about how bad she is. How stressed out she is. That everyone is looking at her and making fun of her. She came to me because she wanted to lose some weight around her belly and have bigger glutes. She said that her face is pretty, but her body is ugly. She wants to do something about that so she would feel better. She wants to feel attractive to her partner (who checks out girls in front of her and even DMs girls on the internet telling them they look good), as he’s not giving her attention.\n\nAt the end of our session, after hearing all this, I told her that to lose weight, she would need to change some things in her daily life. I gave her some examples like eating regularly, eating more vegetables, adding more soups to her menu, sleeping more, and replacing simple carbohydrates with whole grains. I asked her if it was doable for her to make any of those changes.\n\nShe said no. Then I told her that I would like to train with her someday, but maybe it’s not the right time for her to start her fitness journey. I told her that what she needs right now is more help around the house from her partner and her kids (if they’re old enough). Otherwise, if she just adds strength training to her weekly routine, she’ll only get more tired and there won’t be much change in her physique.\n\nI asked her if she had considered therapy so she could learn how to properly communicate with her family that she needs help and to rebuild her self-worth. She said she had thought about it a lot but was reluctant to take action. She also said that she came to me to make herself more attractive to her partner, not for herself.\n\nSo I gave her the contact of the therapist who helped me. She cried a lot, thanked me, and said that I had helped her a lot. I hugged her, and she left.\n\nFrom the perspective of a good person, I feel like I did something good. I don’t have any doubt about that. But as I said previously, I’m not a good salesman yet, and I struggle to get clients. I’m wondering if I could have handled it better — so that I not only helped her but also helped my business.   \nIf you have any advice for me, thank you. If not, thank you for reading :)\n\n  \nDisclaimer: I used AI to correct any language mistakes. English is not my first language.\n\n\nUpdate: \nThank you everyone for sharing your thoughts. Reading the comments I was surprised, as people seem to be divided on this topic. \nI wanted to share with you my final thoughts, but I think that one user phrased it better that I would have.\nI will copy and paste here AAAIISMA-Official’s comment (in case it gets deleted in the future).\n“You clearly cared about her as a person, not just a client or a paycheck and you are to be congratulated for that.\n\nSince you said you are a new personal trainer, let's outline some pros and cons of the situation and offer some advice on how to maybe handle it differently if this situation arises again.\n\nPros / What You Did Right\n\nYou put her well-being first. You recognized she wasn’t mentally or physically ready for structured training, and pushing her into a fitness program could have led to burnout or failure which would’ve reinforced her low self-esteem.\n\nYou demonstrated professionalism and ethics. Not every client is a good fit. Knowing when to say no shows maturity and self-awareness, especially early in your career.\n\nYou built trust. Even if she doesn’t train with you now, she’ll remember that you were honest and kind. She might come back later or refer someone else because you treated her with respect.\n\nYou made a real human impact. Pointing her toward therapy may actually help her far more than workouts would right now.\n\nCons / Missed Opportunities\n\nYou might have been able to keep her engaged in a smaller way. Instead of fully declining, you could’ve offered something extremely low-pressure like one short session a week focused on movement for stress relief or posture, not “results.” That could’ve helped her rebuild consistency and confidence.\n\nYou didn’t have to frame it as “not the right time.” Even though you were being honest, some people can interpret that as rejection. A softer phrasing like “Let’s start with the basics and build from there when you’re ready” could keep the door open while still protecting her from overcommitting.\n\nBottom Line\n\nYou made the right call from an ethical standpoint. The only thing to consider would be to leave the door open and reduce the training rather than shutting it off completely. Something like:\n\n“I think you’ve got a lot on your plate right now, so let’s start small maybe one session a week just to get you moving and feeling a bit better. And if at any point you feel it’s too much, we can pause and focus on recovery or stress management.”\n\nThat kind of approach still helps her, respects her situation, and keeps your business growing.\n\nIf she is still around, consider approaching her again and mentioning this. Maybe she might appreciate you reaching back out to her.\n\nI hope this helps.”\n\nI will also add:\n- I agree that I shouldn’t judge if people will succeed or fail. Especially after 1 hour of talking to them.\n- I disagree with opinions that I did her a disservice. At the end of the day she thanked me and said that I helped her. Although I could did it better. \n\nThank you everyone for help :)",

    "title": "Mistakes You've Made As A Personal Trainer",
    "text": "Hey guys! I've made a ton of mistakes in my close to 15 years of personal training. I've often said to myself, \" If I could go back to the beginning with my current knowledge and skill set, I'd save myself a lot of trouble.\" \n\nWhile you can never help yourself in this regard, you can always help others traveling a similar path.\n\nSo, a few of the mistakes I've made in my personal training career are:\n\n1. Waiting too long to take chances.\n\nI run a studio with over 100 clients and 6 trainers and a YouTube channel that focuses exclusively on personal trainer education. I've been fully self employed for a long time now, and make a living doing what most would deem to be pretty unconventional things.\n\nThere is some inherent risk in all of this, but I know there were times where I still played it a little too safe. Waiting too long to go off on my own and to start my own business are some things that immediately come to mind.\n\n2. I've priced myself too low and cared too much what my competition is doing\n\nPricing is probably the thing that I've changed my mind on the most. I used to focus on what others in the area we're offering and what their price points were. A few years into running a training studio I came to the unfortunate realization that most personal trainers, studio owners included are barely getting by. You probably shouldn't base what you're doing on others who may or may not be doing things well. Over the years I've dialed in on offering the best training in my area and changed up some business variables so I don't have to compete on price as much. Offering semi-private training instead of small group, and charging clients weekly instead of having session packages are examples of this. \n\n3. I've thought that my clients and business we're special and unique too often\n\nDon't get me wrong, I love my clients. Many of them feel like friends that I enjoy spending time with. However, certain people will always try to take advantage of you, whether they mean to or not. I'm guilty of letting clients late cancel without charging them, letting clients convince me to work when It's not a time I offer, and in the very beginning I even let some clients negotiate on price. \n\nThese are all things I no longer let slide. They will kill your business and your desire to be a trainer over time. \n\nAnyways, if you're curious to see these points fleshed out further, I do that here in this video: [https://youtu.be/mKnGtmcfrJc](https://youtu.be/mKnGtmcfrJc)\n\nI also share a few other bone head moves I've made over the years too.\n\nFor those who are brave enough, what are some mistakes you've made as a personal trainer?\n\nWhether you work in a gym, for yourself, or wherever, share it and help someone else avoid the same thing!\n\nThanks guys! Happy training and holidays!",

    "title": "How to determine your price (PT)",
    "text": "I've seen at least three posts in the last 24 hours on this topic, so here’s a simple, logical breakdown for those still agonizing over pricing.\n\nFirst, an important thing to understand: pricing is not a random decision you make before posting an ad or talking to customers. It’s a fundamental part of your overall strategy - how you bridge the gap between your service/product and the market. \n\nMarketing isn’t just about social media content or paid Facebook ads; marketing is the art of designing a service, from creation to full delivery. Setting prices is a part of that.\n\nNow, some questions revolve around pricing personal training sessions (the easier one), while others focus on pricing online offers. In this post, I will only address pricing for Personal Training.\n\nPrinciples and beliefs (or false beliefs) about pricing:\n\n1. You can earn as much as you want. This is true, regardless of the field you work in. While being a movie star vs. offering an hourly service has different limitations, it doesn’t mean you can't be a high earner.\n2. Earning a lot is not a bad thing. If your service is great, if you sell to the right people, and they receive the outcomes they want, you deserve to be paid well.\n3. People will pay for anything. Whether it’s group classes, personal training, or Zumba - so stop playing the victim. Instead, create a service that’s worth paying for and sell it to the right audience.\n4. Your service should not be accessible to everyone. This might sound harsh, especially when considering that better health is beneficial for anyone. But again, people pay for different things - some chase the cheapest option, others look for what’s best for them. Create a service with clear outcomes so you know exactly who your market is.\n5. Fitness is free. Anyone can do push-ups, go for a walk, or get a $20 gym membership and figure things out themselves. Your job is to provide more than just access to exercise. Accepting this will help you understand your own value and position your offer better\n\nFor practical steps, you can approach pricing in two ways:\n1. Based on your desired income\n2. Based on the median income in your area\n\nYour goal may be well below or above the median, but I like using median income as a baseline because it reflects the general willingness to pay within your market.\n\nLet’s say you’re a personal trainer in Berlin, Germany. Here’s how to set a sustainable price for your service:\n\nStep 1: Find the median income for your location.\nBerlin: €47,784 per year (before taxes)\n\nStep 2: Convert that to a monthly salary.\n€47,784 ÷ 12 = €3,982 per month\n\nStep 3: Add a reasonable markup (because you’re self-employed, solving valuable problems).\n€3,982 x 1.25 = ~€5,000 per month\n\nStep 4: Factor in time off (because you don’t want to work year-round).\nLet’s assume 40 days off per year (working 10 months instead of 12).\n€5,000 x 12 months = €60,000 per year → ÷ 10 months = €6,000 per month\n\nStep 5: Account for business expenses.\nSoftware (payment processing, booking, program delivery, etc.): €300\nGym rent/studio rental: €1,000\nAccountant: €250\nInsurance: €150\nMiscellaneous (chamber of commerce, etc.): €50\nTotal Business Expenses: €1,750 per month\n€6,000 + €1,750 = €7,750 before VAT\n\nPlease note: I may use really high margins here as the amounts I put in are somewhat random - no worries, adjust it to what's realistic for your case.\n\nStep 6: Account for VAT (19% in Germany).\n\n➡️ €7,750 x 1.19 = ~€9,222 per month\n\nStep 7: Determine how much you want to work. A lot of trainers make the mistake of thinking they can do 8-10 sessions a day, five days a week. But that is not sustainable. You have admin work with the service (feedback, scheduling, new client appointments, ongoing education), and admin work with the business (accounting, invoicing, partnership meetings) - all these should happen within your hours, not on top of it. \n\nAdditionally, imagine 7 x 60 minutes with 7 different stories - how excited are you for the 8th appointment? For these reasons, I assume 5 days with average 5 sessions a day.\n\n5 days a week, 5 sessions per day = 100 sessions per month.\n\n➡️ €9,222 ÷ 100 = ~€92.50 per session\n\nAt this point, you have three options:\n1. If this price works for you - Great! Charge appropriately and fill your schedule.\n2. If this price feels too low - Even better! Charge more and work smarter, you do not need to worry about living paycheck to paycheck.\n3. If this price feels too high - Identify what needs to change for you to confidently charge it.\n\nTo justify higher prices, you need to level up your service:\n\n1. Market research: What are your competitors doing and what are they charging for it? Can you do better than them?\n2. Identify your strengths: What do you already do well? Can you leverage it?\n3. Address your weaknesses: Where can you improve to command higher rates? This is a combination of the previous 2.\n\nA final thought: if you’re afraid to charge higher prices, it’s not about the world - it’s your mindset. People pay for anything. If you think \"it’s too much,\" that’s a reflection of your own beliefs about money. The solution? Improve your service, build confidence, and charge what you're worth.",

    "text": "Just like everyone else, sometimes at the end of a long work day the last thing I want to do is workout even though “exercise is my job.” Sometimes I even have week or so long periods of skipping the gym. Honestly it makes me feel a bit hypocritical. I’m not out here shaming clients for missing workouts or anything like that, but exercise being my career and then not being in the mood to do it myself is where the hypocritical feeling comes from. \n\nCurious if anyone has things they do to deal with similar feelings ",

Prior to getting certified, I was a long time member at both gyms. I absolutely love my job. \n\nHowever, I've found that the quality of my own workouts has suffered severely in the past couple years. I am naturally introverted, and it is very hard for me to focus on my workout in an environment where everybody knows me/tries to talk to me. I am very personable when interacting with others, but feeling like I have to always be \"on\" while doing my workouts is...exhausting.\n\nI am considering getting another membership at a gym across town to see how much of a difference it makes. Do any of you feel this way as well?\n\n",

While I know it’s probably the right decision for me, I’m scared of making the wrong decision!\nI know there are some things I’ll miss about my 9-5 but I know growth doesn’t come by staying the same. \nHas anyone else done this and could offer some advice?

    "title": "First Training Job",
    "text": "So far it sucks :)\n\nBrief background… I’m mid 50’s and work a full time job that I love and have been a fitness enthusiast for most of my adult life. I contemplated getting the PT certification for 6+ years and finally followed through several months ago. I always thought it would be a fun and meaningful way to earn some supplemental income, plus I genuinely like to stay busy and enjoy working with people. During my full time job, I’m often solo and have little daily interaction with other people.\n\nI applied to a commercial gym (assumed it would be the easiest way to start), and got hired on the spot during my first interview. Maybe that should have been the first red flag. 😂\n\nThe new hire process has been totally disjointed. My first two days were a waste of time. They didn’t have anything ready and I literally did nothing. There’s no structure to the onboarding or direction as to what’s next. My first paycheck was grossly wrong, and most of the staff seem unhappy. In fact, a few seem like very miserable people. Nobody even acknowledged me when I first started. So weird! I make eye contact, smile and say hello to everyone.\n\nI’m trying to reserve judgment (it’s only been a couple weeks). Maybe everything will work out after I’ve gained some clients. I figure gaining a bit of experience will make it easier to transition to another gym if needed.\n\nBut, are they all like this? Is this what the industry is like? My first impressions are unprofessional and anybody can be a trainer. Seems like just a PT mill. The “set you up for success” component is missing.\n\nFor what it’s worth… I have extensive sales experience and raised a family of 5 on a commission only salary for 15+ years. I did not go into this jaded about the selling aspect of being a PT. ",

    "title": "Pricing principles",
    "text": "Pricing seems to be a hot topic with recurring questions about best practices, packaging services, finding what works for both you and your clients, and how to price for in-person vs. online offers.\n\nSo, I decided to gather some core principles you should consider before setting your pricing: \n\n1. Charging for sessions will limit you forever. Charging for solutions puts you in the lead.\n\nThere’s a common conflict in personal training:\nA single session often costs more than a package of 8, 12, or 16 - yet if someone wants a shorter session (30 mins), we lower the price again (half of the single session price). How does that make sense?\n\n- This happens because you believe you’re charging for your time, offering discounts to encourage commitment.\n- But once you shift your mindset to charging for solutions, you realize the less time you have to deliver results, the harder your job becomes - and harder jobs should cost more. Think of express delivery pricing - faster = more expensive.\n- Anyhow, has any client ever said, “My goal is to see you 2 x 60 minutes per week”? No - they talk about results. So why charge for time instead of the value of outcomes?\n\nStop looking at your service as time-based and start seeing it as value-based.\n\n2. Price reflects your positioning, not just affordability.\n\n- Low prices can undermine your credibility and attract the wrong clients. If people think it’s expensive, it’s not because you are - it’s because your positioning attracts those not ready to commit.\n- High-value services require confidence in pricing and the ability to communicate why it’s worth it.\n- If your prices are below what the median income can easily afford, you risk signaling that your service can’t deliver on its promises. I made a post earlier on how to set your price based on the median income - it goes both ways; giving you a decent living, while using a price point that's more than affordable in your region.\n- Pricing is a marketing tool. Set your price too low, and people won’t believe you’re the one to work with.\n\n3. Sustainable pricing = Sustainable service.\n\n- Undervaluing yourself leads to burnout, poor service, and eventually resentment.\n- Low prices attract low-value clients, and they’ll keep you stuck in a low-value environment.\n- Proper pricing allows you to: pay yourself a decent salary, reinvest in your business, deliver a consistent, 5-star service over the long term.\n\n4. Pricing = Leadership.\n\n- When you set your prices with confidence, you lead your clients. Use reasonable frameworks (not guesses) to determine pricing.\n- Pricing teaches clients to value themselves. Investing in health requires money, time, and energy. If someone didn’t invest time or energy before (like you or me), now they must invest money to catch up.\n- Leadership means confidence, which builds trust. Never discount to buy someone in or signal insecurity about your prices. Know your worth.\n\n5. Your price must match your promise.\n\n- If the results you deliver are life-changing, your price must reflect that.\n- You can’t solve serious problems with low-cost solutions - and agreeing to clients’ low standards won’t help anyone.\n- Get clarity on who you serve and what you deliver. Pricing becomes easier when you attract the right clients - the ones who value what you offer.\n- Yes, the market’s willingness to pay matters. But if you know you deliver above-market value, your price must reflect your own value, not your competitors’.\n\nFinal Thought:\n\nPrice is more than a number - it’s a statement about your service, your leadership, your belief in what you deliver, and ultimately, it’s a business strategy.\n\nI fully understand the realities of working as an employee in a gym and the fears or challenges of being self-employed. So instead of dismissing these principles as “impossible” for your situation, let’s open the conversation. Share with me:\n\nWhich principle hit home for you the most?\nWhich principle feels out of reach right now?",
