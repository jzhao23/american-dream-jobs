I found out yesterday that their protected status is being revoked and they have two weeks to leave the US. \n\nThese kids are seniors, they all have jobs and are just out here to survive. Now they are forced to go back to Haiti where they said it's not safe for them. I wanted to see them graduate, now they'll never be able to walk across the stage. I've been crying for hours yesterday but there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nAnd it hurts me more that the majority of my schools teachers voted for this (super red state). It's disgusting. \n\nWhat am I supposed to tell the class one they notice our students are missing? We aren't allowed to talk politics really, but I can't lie to them. I'm 22, it's my first year teaching, I never thought I'd have to encounter a situation like this. America needs to do better for our children.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the support, I think my students need it more than I do but I appreciate it none the less. \n\nSome comments mentioned the idea of setting up a fund. I LOVE the idea, but I'll be honest I have no idea how to put something like that in action. If anyone knows how to create something like that please reach out. Thank you again. ",

    "text": "I teach high school in the US, mostly freshmen. As I looked at my class rosters this year, I expected more of the same: mostly unfamiliar names of students coming up from the middle school and the occasional surname I recognized as possible relatives of former students I've had prior. But, this year especially, I saw something I've only seen sparingly in my twenty-some years as an educator. Each of my classes contained three to five students, twelve to fifteen total, whom I had last year. As I witnessed these students' self-discipline, work ethic, motivation, and in some cases, attendance from last year, I knew that they had failed first semester. They did not attend summer school. And, for the first time since I've been around, the number of credit recovery classes was greatly reduced due to budget cuts. So these students had to retake my class for graduation credit. \n\nThen something dawned on me that should should have been apparent prior: _Every single one of those dozen-or-so repeaters were boys._ 100%. Not a single young lady had to retake freshman geography. But about fourteen boys, give or take, did. Fourteen out of fourteen. All boys. The implication to me was apparent: this social crisis among boys is is something we can't afford to ignore any longer.\n\nIf you teach, you likely aren't surprised by this. I'm sure by now you've heard that young men are experiencing somewhat of a crisis in regards to education, workforce readiness, success outcomes, and ultimately, quality of life. Numerous studies and publications have been signaling the alarm for over a decade. I'm unsure of this is a uniquely American phenomenon, or Western, or global (maybe educators outside the US can report on this). The resulting impact on society will reach into everyone's lives, regardless if they have children or not. Crime will certainly increase. The social and political effects have already caused incalculable damage to society and will only increase until we figure this out.\n\nSo, why is this happening? What can we do to reverse it? Both as a society, and through smaller measures as individual educators? What are your thoughts or stories surrounding this phenomenon?\n\nThanks for reading.",

    "title": "Gaslighting a Student (AKA The Best Lesson I Ever Taught)",
    "text": "I have a student, we’ll name him John. For the past few months, John has been the bane of my existence. Talking nonstop, never seated, needs to be redirected constantly, submits almost no work, on his phone constantly, and when confronted about his test performance, blames me for “not teaching that” (spoiler: I did teach that). \n\nThe lesson: Teach John what it’s like to teach John. So that he didn’t fail the quarter, upon the request of his mother (and admin forcing my hand), I gave an extra credit project. At first I wasn’t too happy about this, but I quickly realized it was a wonderful opportunity. I made him present his project to me and a group of other teachers. During this presentation, my colleague was on his phone the whole time. Myself and another colleague talked over John multiple times. The fourth interrupted with “sorry John, I just need to run to the bathroom really quickly,” just to come back in and interrupt with more questions. To his credit, John powered through the presentation. At the end, I turned to him and asked, “How can I give you credit for this when you didn’t mention X, Y, or Z?” (All things he did, in fact, mention.) “You weren’t very clear about X” (There was a whole slide about X.) We went back and forth, with John getting increasingly frustrated defending himself and complaining about how we weren’t a very good audience. He was turning red explaining that if we just *listened* and let him present, we would’ve seen these things. Interesting. After a few minutes, the realization hit. While he didn’t *say* anything, the lightbulb that went off in his head said everything I needed to hear. \n\nOf course, I’ll grade John on the actual work he turned in, not the presentation. (And I did tell him this, I’m not evil.) But, something tells me next quarter will be a lot smoother, for both me and John.  Here’s to hoping. \n\nFOLLOW UP: \nHere’s the long awaited follow up. In hindsight, I probably should’ve waited a little more than a month to update. We’ve had quite a few snow days, so it doesn’t feel like I’ve had a good amount of actual class time to accurately assess. With that being said, I have to give John a good amount of credit. There has been a fair amount of measurable change. He certainly has not become the perfect student overnight, he still interrupts from time to time, and definitely isn’t seated throughout the whole class period. \n\nWhat has changed though, is John’s ability to read the room, show empathy to his teachers, and self correct. Just this week alone, I can’t count the number of times he has started to behave like John, and without me saying anything, self-corrected. He’ll usually do this will a comment like “I’m driving you insane, aren’t I Ms. MagesticAvocado? My bad. I’ll lock in.” After that point, he’s generally been able to do as he says he will. Considering the fact that these interactions used to derail him for an entire block, I’m happy with this result. He hasn’t received a single write up since his presentation for me, and he’s only been late on one assignment, which was eventually completed to the best of his ability.  While we still have work to do, he’d leaps and bounds ahead of where he was when I met him. And I’m optimistic moving forward. My only hope is things stay this way.",

Forty minutes later he vomited in the classroom. We sent him home immediately, called the parents. Their response? “He only threw up once, last night. We thought it was just something he ate.”\n\nThe next day, two more students started complaining about stomach aches. Both ended up going home after vomiting.\n\nBy Friday night, it hit me. I spent the night hugging the toilet, completely wrecked. Two full days unable to keep anything down, both ends.

All because some parents thought “he was fine now.”\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint, it’s a plea: If your child is vomiting, has diarrhea, a fever, or any signs of sickness, please, do not send them to school.\n\nWhat’s worse is… this isn’t the first time.

    "title": "Teacher Fired for Charlie Kirk Post Sues",
    "text": "An Iowa high school teacher claims his First Amendment rights were violated when he was fired for his online post following the shooting death of conservative political activist Charlie Kirk.\n\nMatthew Kargol’s termination by the Oskaloosa Community School District came after he’d gone home and posted “1 Nazi Down” on his personal social media account. His lawsuit, filed Thursday at the US District Court for the Southern District of Iowa, comes amid a large backlash against people whose comments are perceived to criticize Kirk in the wake of his death.\n\nKargol was fired by Oskaloosa Community School District Superintendent Michael Fisher. In his complaint Kargol said that his dismissal violated his right to free speech protected by the First Amendment. He stressed that his comment was on a matter of public concern, made during his own time and on his own computer, and that there was no evidence of any disruption at school from his comment.\n\nI have to agree with the teacher. Though it is usually not considered ok to celebrate the death of another person, you can't punish people for not being sad over it. Some people have done things that made them unpopular. Were people punished when Osama Bin Laden or Jeff Epstein died and they made comments? No. Of course not. I'm not saying Kirk is at the same level as those people, but he said and did a lot of things that made him unpopular. \n\nI hope the teacher win their lawsuit. We have a right to express ourselves as long as it doesn't harm others. \n\n[https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/teacher-fired-for-charlie-kirk-post-sues-iowa-school-district](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/teacher-fired-for-charlie-kirk-post-sues-iowa-school-district)",

    "text": "I teach first grade, and my group this year has been, shall we say, behaviorally challenged.  Constant interruptions (way more than normal for first grade), disrespect, fighting, you name it.  I’ve struggled to bring my class under control and I’ve taught over twenty-two years now.  It’s not just me, though; our whole school is struggling with behavior right now. \n\nMy principal sent us a tik-tok as a joke.  I’d link it if I could but I’m not sure how.  Anyway, the video had a teacher telling how she gained control over her class using a counting clicker.  I decided to try it and bought a clicker off Amazon. \n\nThe day I started it, I didn’t draw attention to the clicker.  I’d just click it every time the kids disrupted, broke rules, argued, etc.   The kids noticed me using it but I wouldn’t tell them what is was for.  At the end of the day, I wrote our total number of clicks (314) on the board and explained.  I told them if we did better the next day, everyone would earn a dojo point.  The next day, they only had 72 disruptions.  It’s gone steadily downhill since. On Friday, we had 6 disruptions the entire day…including transition times.  \n\nI’ve been using this for a couple of weeks now and I’ve Pavloved my students into good behavior!  All I have to do now is hold up the clicker and the kids police themselves.  \n\nI don’t know how you could tweak it for older kids, but elementary kids are eating it up.  Several other teachers are now using clickers and have noticed success as well. \n\nA few points, in case you want to try this:  don’t use punishment for clicks, only positive reinforcement.  I set the day’s goal (ten or less) in the morning and if they make it, everyone gets a dojo point or special treat.  If we don’t make it, no one is punished, they just don’t get the points.  ",

This morning, one of my students (one of my most trustworthy students) came into my room and told me about something that happened yesterday. \n\nShe was going her schoolwork underneath my desk because she likes the cozy rug (which used to be part of a seating area across the room where students could sit and do their work, but those privileges were last this semester, so I just recently moved it under my desk) I have under there, so she was completely unseen. Two teachers came into my room and proceeded to talk shit about me, my decorations, and even my personal pictures I have on my wall (including MY BOYFRIEND????) while she was hidden under there. They were dropping f-bombs left and right, just verbally trashing the place up. Now apparently my sub came in the room and heard some of it, informed them that a student was underneath the desk the whole time, to which they fell silent for an extended period of time before leaving. \n\nThis student knows who these teachers are, and they’re both women who are 10+ years older than me. I’m a first year teacher. This isn’t giving a lot of incentive to keep at this career if the grown ass staff is acting more childish than the students. Seeing adults act like clique-y mean girls who peaked in high school, especially towards A FIRST YEAR TEACHER, is very off-putting and doesn’t give me much desire to stay in this district for long.\n\nImagine being almost 50 and talking shit behind a 29-year-old’s back, in THEIR OWN CLASSROOM? Seriously thought I was teaching high school, not reliving it all over again. \n\nEDIT: Since this seems to be an issue, I don’t let this student work under my desk. That has never happened while I’m there, but since I HAD A SUB THAT DAY, I had no control over the situation. Admin unlocks classroom doors every morning before school starts, so free access for students isn’t even on me or other teachers.",

My son showed me screenshots and swears every teacher has one.\n\nI'm currently on leave because a couple of students (all friends, failing my class) have decided to lash out at me. One is making an allegation and the others are corroborating. They are claiming it happened during class and I am hoping that someone will come forward and tell the truth.\n\nEven if they do, this will probably cost me my job. Possibly my career.

    "text": "Hi everyone. I’m a school counselor. I posted this on the school counseling sub, but I’m genuinely wondering if teachers are noticing similar issues in the classroom. I’m not sure what to do about it but I’d like to prepare somehow for next Fall. \n\nSo, one of my favorite parts of the job is the career counseling portion. I always offer to help students with applications if needed because I know it can be intimidating. However, I've noticed that each year, the students have less and less general knowledge. They need help answering literally every single question - even the most basic questions, most of which you should learn in elementary school. I need to know if this is the \"norm\" everywhere. Here are some examples:\n\n  \n\\-I don't know my mom or dad's job\n\n\\-I don't know if my mom or dad went to college\n\n\\-I don't know my zip code (often confused with area code)\n\n\\-we live in Pennsylvania, right?\n\n\\-Wait, what county are we in?\n\n\\-What does \"starting semester\" mean? Do I apply for Spring 2025 or Fall?\"\n\n\\-I know my birthday is in December but I forget the date (this was a freshman applying for vo-tech)\n\n\\-I don't know how to check my email\n\n\\-What does this mean?

    "text": "Dear experienced teachers, \n\nOn behalf of all early career teachers, I would like to thank you in advance for all of your support as we go into this next school year. Teaching is a stressful job, and your guidance is deeply appreciated. \n\nWith that said, please stop telling us we are going to end up hating teaching. Many first year teachers have been dreaming of this since childhood and are so excited to get their own classroom. Everyone tells us how hard teaching is; it doesn’t feel good to walk into a school and have your coworkers tell you the joy you are feeling is bound to disappear. \n\nI had a coworker who repeatedly made comments about how she remembered being excited for work, how I wasn’t jaded yet, or how the students were going to beat the green out of me, and when I said I loved my first year, she said, “oh that won’t last much longer.” \n\nI’ve seen replies with this sentiment on posts from new teachers asking for advice (“leave while you can” “give it a year, you’ll hate the kids” etc.) . Please provide your advice, don’t project negative experiences onto someone excited to join the field. It’s really hard to love something when you’re constantly told you will grow to resent it. If we end up hating it, so be it! But let us discover that on our own. \n\nOnce again, your wisdom is deeply appreciated, just please choose your words carefully. \n\nSincerely, \nA Second Year Teacher\n",

I felt like too much would take focus away from where it mattered...my board in the front or wherever I'm pacing around the room during demonstrations.\n\nThere's extra spaces for team studies and small groups, and I arranged my desks for mini Socratic seminars for teams, with the tables able to be pushed together for group projects and labs.\n\nOverall, I was pretty proud of it since I basically had to design and construct it myself over 3 days.  Back to School Night apparently made my classroom the most \"goated\" place in the school (direct quote from my students).

    "text": "For reference, I teach freshmen and sophomores at a well-respected state university in my area. I teach classes that are only required for students in my major, so I am not even dealing with GenEd students. These students want to pursue a career in this field.  \n\nMy students complain about literally any amount of homework. Some of them even explicitly say, \"We weren't given this type of homework in high school,\" to about 30 minutes of work over a two day period. I keep trying to tell them that real work in this field can mean 5-7 hour days of working on the same issue. If they aren't cut out to do my small assignment before each class, they absolutely will not make it in this field. Colleagues of mine assign closer to 2-3 hours of homework every other day (as many major-specific courses do), and I have tried warning my students. \n\nEven past their apathy, though, their skills are closer to what I'd expect from high school freshman and sophomores. They brag about never reading books because of Covid in middle and high school. They don't do long-form reading. When I assign them a couple of pages to read before a class, most of them won't even read, and the ones that do cannot tell me a single important thing about it. It is like they actually lack reading comprehension. On our exam that we just gave, there was a bonus question that said, \"interpret your findings,\" and almost all of them left it blank. They did all the methodical and algorthmic things decently well, but no one in that class has any idea was it means. \n\nThey don't think. They don't really experience thought the way they're supposed to. It is like it's a bunch of brains on autopilot. With high school, I can almost maybe understand not caring because you're required to be there. But, with college, most of my students are paying to be here. Even then, they complain about every amount of work that they have to do, and then can't even do their work with any level of academic rigor. \n\nI am a very nice teacher, but I tell them at the beginning of every semester what my expectations are. I have failed students in the past, and I will continue to fail students right now. I know a lot of high schools try to push students through to graduation, but, in university, I have pretty much free reign of who I pass and fail. But despite them watching about 3-4 of their friends fail out of our department every semester, none of them change anything and just hope they skate by. I just don't get it. ",

    "text": "A family friend of mine is a teacher, and we recently took a quick trip to Best Buy to pick up a new wireless mouse I needed. I grabbed the mouse in a second, only to see that she had picked up about 5 USBs. I asked why, and she said they were for her students. I threw a Hail Mary and asked her if she'd be compensated, but of course the answer was no. The whole ride back, she was emailing the parents that she bought them. \n\nOn a Saturday. \n\nPlease just don't do this. Y'all need to stand up and just say no, please don't feel obligated to work off the clock. You are not responsible for their school supplies. You should absolutely turn your phone on at 8:55 and off at 3:20. Work your paid prep time but don't give a second more unless YOU want to. \n\nIf work doesn't get done, so be it. Your family needs you much more than your school: the weekend if for them. \n\nEDITED TO ADD: love all your comments. You're all heroes. Wanted to just include the concept of induced demand someone brought up: the reward for finishing your work is often just more work and more stress. It's not worth it. You're more than your job, always remember that. \n\nEDITED AGAIN: I wanted to respond to a common perspective you've all shared: \"maybe she actually wanted to\". Folks, I've seen this woman exhausted, pale, and holding her head almost in tears after a long day. She seems burnt out, and although she hasn't said it, her gas tank looks like it's been running on empty for a while now. I don't want to make it look like I know what it's like to be a teacher because I don't. \n\nBut there has to be another way. You need to be adequately recognized and compensated for what you do. Think of a lawyer billing additional time for a more complicated case. Think of a mechanic increasing their charge because a \"simple\" fix turned out to be more intricate than originally expected. To echo a comment I read: you're not just a teacher. You're a human being with the same stuff we all have - hopes, dreams, goals, hobbies, and a family - that just so happens to be a teacher. \n\nFINAL EDIT: I want to thank everyone who responded to this post. You've all shared such unique perspectives on time management, salary, and education as a whole. I think I'll always come back to this post and reply to comments when I can. From a non-teacher, thank you for caring and commenting. ",

We were anticipating spending so much more for a private program, so I’d love to help work to continue that this is the best school in our region.

This kid curses, destroys things on occasion and mouths off to the principal in front of their entire class, they have multiple one on ones because this kid wears even specialists out in the course of a single day, the whole school is kinda bending over backwards for this one student and the police have been called to deal with at least a few situations within the last year.\n\nThe kids in their class kinda hate this kid and have had to deal with them for a few years now and their behavior is not good overall because they see this other kid get away with breaking almost every rule for multiple years, which makes them just..m not care about the rules, since they are not enforced evenly.\n\nWe are supposed to have the counselors talk with students, but this has happened before and the kids see it as so much bullshit and excuses and I really can't blame them much. Our grade's behavior is getting all the teachers in trouble but it mostly all stems from this one student.\n\nWhat do you even do in this situation? \n\n*Edit: because everyone is making assumptions, the student is female, and they do not get severely or sustainedly violent, although a few shins have been kicked and belongings have been thrown, the big issue is verbal abuse and constant unending chatter*\n\n*Edit 2: the majority of the replies seem to be irate parents, and at least a few bots stirring the pot, not anyone who has even a certificate in education*",

    "text": "Governor Ron DeSantis continues to highlight Florida’s increasing education budget, yet much of that money never makes it into teachers’ paychecks. Instead, it’s funneled toward raising starting salaries while veteran educators—the foundation of the system—are left with stagnant wages. The referendum funding that’s supposed to help is nothing more than a public opinion gamble, leaving teachers’ financial security in the hands of voters rather than treating education as the essential service it is. No teacher should have to rely on the hope that their community values education enough to ensure they get paid fairly. Every child deserves access to a quality education, and that starts with retaining experienced, well-compensated teachers—not leaving them to wonder if their next raise will be on the ballot.\n\nThis is bigger than just a budget—it’s an entire generation at stake. The decisions being made today will shape Florida’s future workforce, economy, and society for decades. The state proudly claims to be ranked #1 in education, but step into any high school English classroom and the reality tells a different story. Basic literacy issues persist, with students struggling to sound out simple words. A decade ago, education outcomes were stronger. Now, national data confirms a steady decline in literacy, comprehension, and critical thinking.\n\nTeachers are walking away because the job is unsustainable. Workloads have tripled, classrooms are overcrowded, and yet the pay sits at $48,000 with an unreliable bonus system tied to a referendum. Why would anyone take on a high-stress, high-responsibility job for that salary when they can find better pay with less stress elsewhere? At this rate, Florida isn’t just facing a teacher shortage—it’s heading toward an educational collapse, where students are left behind because leadership values talking points over real investment in schools.\n\nThis isn’t about politics; it’s about common sense. Even those who support DeSantis should recognize that if Florida doesn’t address this now, the long-term consequences will be devastating. A population that lacks basic comprehension, a workforce that can’t meet future demands, and an economy weakened by a lack of skilled labor. Teachers are professionals who shape the next generation, and they deserve compensation that reflects their worth. If Florida continues to neglect this, the cost won’t just be failing schools—it will be a failing society.",

Also, perpetrators with more money are less likely to face consequences and DV victims in wealthy families are statistically less likely to get help from social workers and won’t have access to government assistance/FAFSA based on their parent/abuser’s income even if they don’t see a penny of it.\n\nSomeone might also have hardships or traumas that aren’t on that list and get a high number of points which would feel invalidating or echo statements made to them by abusers. \n\nYou can’t quantify human suffering and it just seems tasteless to assign points to someone’s life like that.\n\nThere’s an alternative activity called “Privilege for Sale” which doesn’t make it a contest or a point system and lists various privileges associated with different “isms” like walking around at night as a man or getting a job or assistance more easily as a citizen, and it actually shows what the obstacles are and how to make things more equitable, like maybe inviting friends to the library instead of Starbucks to not exclude low income people etc.",

It's not because of the kids, not because of the work (though it's hard), but because of how I'm perceived *outside* the classroom.\n\nIn the past two months alone, *six* different women have told me they wouldn't date me because I \"don't make enough money.\" Another one told me to my face, \"Why would a grown man want to hang around children all day?\" That one really fucking sucked. I know some people think male teachers, especially in younger grades, are creepy by default, like there's some ulterior motive. It's exhausting having to prove you're *not* a predator just because you care about kids and want to make a difference.\n\nI got into teaching because I genuinely love it. I believe in what I do. But when people treat your job like a red flag, when you're constantly having to justify your paycheck and your motives, when you feel like your career actively *hurts* your chances at being seen as dateable or even normal, it starts to wear you down.\n\nI'm NOT trying to implicate women. Y'all have your own shit to deal with that I will never fully comprehend as a man. This behavior sucks, though.\n\nI'm tired. I don't know if I can keep doing this when it feels like the world looks at me sideways for choosing this path.  \n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\nEDIT: I appreciate people taking the time to offer kind words. \n\nIt’s not just that these women are filtering themselves out, it’s that their worldview *shrinks the pool* before I even get a chance to show up as myself. Like yeah, I’m glad I’m not dating someone who doesn’t respect my work or values money over meaning  obviously. But please don't pretend that this is just a clean win. What it actually means is that a whole chunk of potential connection is off the table *by default* because of a judgment about my profession, my paycheck, or my gender in a caregiving role.\n\nThat’s not just a “bad fit” walking away. ***That’s me playing the game with fewer pieces on the board.***\n\nAnd yeah, actually, that sucks. It’s not a self-pity thing, it’s a *math* thing. If the cultural narrative says men should be providers and high earners, and that men who work with kids are suspect or soft or not “masculine” enough, then I’m not starting at zero like everyone else. I’m starting in the red, trying to earn back credibility for just caring about something that isn’t profit.\n\nSo when people say, “Well good riddance to those women,” I want to say: *Sure*. But also, that’s a symptom of a deeper problem in which my dating pool is artificially limited because I don’t conform to a narrow, outdated idea of what a man should be. That’s not just a personal annoyance. That’s systemic. And it’s lonely.",

We are so far ahead with technology and our yearbooks don’t look like the cookie cutter yearbooks that everyone does (you know, a few pics on a page along with a long ass story…we put tons of pics on the pages and a few sentences of what the page is/what the event is/how the sports team did). \n\nEvery year, I use my fall, winter, and spring breaks to work on it. Creating the yearbook is a full time job, and we have won numerous awards.\n\nI’m broken right now. The only reason I’m staying is because my child goes to the school and I don’t want to move her (thankfully I still get my discount for her tuition).\n\nFor the past 10 years, I have given this school everything…my time, my love for the students, my photography and graphic design talents, everything. So when the shit started rolling downhill and I was at the bottom, this decision literally broke my heart. I can’t stop crying because this is at the forefront of my mind.\n\nI can’t leave because if I do, I lose the tuition assistance (I had to give them an answer right then in the meeting, and since my child is the most important thing in my life, I want to make sure she gets a stellar education).\n\nI just needed to vent. I don’t feel any better, but if you’ve ever been put in this situation, please share because right now I feel like an absolute failure.",

    "text": "Before I make my point, I want to point out...\n\n1. I worked before in fast food, trucking, retail and substitute teaching for many years respectively\n2. I'm in my 6th year as a classroom teacher\n3. I acknowledge all teaching jobs aren't created equal, esp. throughout USA. Some areas pay close to minimum wage while forcing 3rd-world working conditions while other areas pay over six figures. I work in a blue state with decent pay and benefits so this is just from my perspective, so obviously this may not apply for everybody. \n\nYes, the job may be stressful at times. \n\n* It's mentally draining having to multitask and do the work of 5-10 people while teaching, having to print/make copies, grade papers, monitor students, model lessons and answer phone calls from the office all at the same time without the benefit of being able to clone yourself in TEN. \n* I dislike the fact that I \\[can potentially\\] get blamed for EVERYTHING that happens (i.e. student noncompliance, poor work ethic, questionable parenting, etc.) \n* I dislike the fear and nervousness of unannounced classroom observations and my value being determined by \"numbers\"\n* I have a hard time working for delusional admins who expect miracles to be performed and expectations being unclear and always shifted and changed last-minute\n\nBut everytime I'm having a \"terrible\" day I always look back and stay grateful for what I DO have. \n\n* I work 6 hours a day (5 actually teaching) and &lt;190 days a year compared to most jobs (8+ hours a day, \\~250 days a year). \n* I DO spend most of my day active and under stress but I'm so preoccupied with my delivery, performance and meeting deadlines that I rarely if ever, have time to look at the clock. I'd a million times rather be preoccupied than be standing in a spot or a room for 8+ hours where ONE workday feels like an ETERNITY like most other jobs do. \n* My hard work is ACTUALLY benefitting society...CHILDREN. Kids who are mostly starved of love, guidance and affection (figuratively speaking of course) and look up to me as a role model and important figure in life. Unlike most jobs where their hard work is going to make some greedy billionaire richer so he can buy his 15th yacht. \n* My job is secure and \\[almost\\] guaranteed, especially after tenure. I am salaried and my income is stable. I don't have to worry about a cheap greedy manager/owner slashing my hours or benefits for their own personal gain. I don't have to work 2+ jobs to put food on the table or a roof over my head.\n* I have a decent union that makes sure my job abides by labor laws. Our time is respected. Apart from lesson planning and miscellaneous paperwork, nobody takes advantage of us or makes us work a minute later compared to many jobs who break laws and blackmail their employees so more work can get done for less pay. \n* Decent Pension, 401k and Roth IRA options. Many jobs offer none of these and who knows if SS will even exist in the future?\n* No manual labor. My job is arduous at times but when you relatively compare yourself to tens/hundreds of millions of people around the world baking in the 100-degree sun 12 hours a day, 6-7 days a week while getting paid PENNIES, I'm grateful to have what I have. \n* Personal time consumed for Lesson Planing and paperwork varies by job and location, but that time is OPTIONAL and FLEXIBLE. You can plan in your lunch period, before work or the afternoon from your house. Also as the years go by and you gain experience, the time you spend lesson planning gradually diminishes\n\n  \nDo I wish teachers were respected more and things changed for the better? Yes. \n\nDo I wish my pay was higher? Yes. \n\nTeaching may not be the easiest or highest-paying job in the world, but despite all the negatives, there's alot of positives and overall I'm grateful to be where I am today. How do you guys feel?",

    "text": "I am completely at a loss and have been sobbing in my house all afternoon. \n\nI accepted a position over a month ago with a local district under the impression I would be receiving a specific salary. I live in Ohio so I have to abide by the July 10 deadline for freely resigning without the boards approval. Well last week, after July 10, I was informed that they would be regressing my salary due to not accepting my post graduate credits. \n\nI never once doubted them taking my credits as my prior district did and the DOE recognized them for my licensure requirements. I really cannot financially afford to make less and have been losing sleep, hair, and weight worrying about it. Well today, I put in my resignation (very professional in verbiage) expressing a bit of the situation and how I would not be able to continue with the district due to financial hardship. \n\nI received an email which was unpleasant in tone and honestly seemed punitive stating that they are denying my resignation and will not allow me out of the contract. I did respond back laying out some facts and what not along with asking them to reconsider. \n\nI just don’t know what to do if they do not respond today as I would be required to go in Monday for an orientation. We have not started school and I have completed no work for them. I just am at a loss that I could be forced to remain in this contract or potentially get my license suspended. How would you expect a teacher to respond to that or enjoy coming into work after that? I do have other options within education in different districts which would pay more but I’m worried the state will come after my license. I don’t even know how to respond if they truly deny my resignation. \n\nI just don’t know what to do and am very discouraged and sad. \n\nEdit: This is the verbiage in my signed contract which was signed in June and I was not informed until July 23 of a change “Notice will be given annually, no later than July 1, to each Teacher who holds a contract valid for the succeeding year as to the salary\nto be paid such Teacher during such year.”\n\nEdit 2: thank you everyone for your advice! I have let them know that I will not be reporting for the 25/26 school year and any further communication will come from my legal counsel. I also got offered my dream job and that district is going to attempt to help me out! The thought of working at that school after all of this was making me sick so I feel better after sending that last email. ",

    "title": "My push back against judging parents. ",
    "text": "Someone posted a post about their judgement towards students' work ethic and how these students are simply the product of poor parenting.\n\nI want to critique this. As a teacher, I don't really judge parents. I take it a step further: I judge our entire society and its **failings**. Children are the creations of their parents, and their parents are the creations of society. And whatever subliminal messaging the parent recieved, the child will recieve.\n\nOn the internaitonal stage, the United States rarely ranks highly when it comes to k-12 education, and we especially rank low when it comes to math scores. (sorry for being American centric. I am American; therefore, this is the only country I can speak on).\n\nLet's say a parent comes from a lower socioeconomic background. *Their* parents were not able help them on their education and their mom and dad were always busy working at their low-paying jobs. This parent would go to school, and they struggled in reading and writing AND math and science. They graduated high school with a 1.8 GPA. After they finish high school, they work at the local factory or Mcdonanld's, and at 23, they have a child.\n\nThe cycle of low achievement and low educational prosperity continues in their child. Now you are probably thinking, how is this the fault of American society?\n\nThe schools the parent and child went to didn't have enough funding. The teachers were given a low salary. The class sizes were too big. Because of issues with funding, there weren't any paras or teaching assistants to ease the burden off the teachers. The low-paying job the parent worked didn't assist them with going back to school. They didn'tget any PTO; therefore, if they try to stay home with their kids, they will lose money.\n\nAll of these problems are societal and governmental issues that state and federal governments can help allievate.\n\nAs educators, we need to understand something really important about our education system: we are working within a country that doesn't prize educational achievement for **ALL** of its citizens. Therefore, how I can I throw my nose up in the air at a child or parent who obviously weren't even given a fighting chance to begin with?\n\n**TLDR: As an educator, start seeing the bigger picture. The problem with contemporary American education is more than \"bad parenting.\" It is a societal problem that starts all the way at the federal level.**",

    "text": "(EDIT: I am fully credentialed in the state of California and have taught here for 2 years. Some people misunderstood and thought I only held a Texas license)\n\nYes, there is a \"teacher shortage,\" but as someone who moved from Texas to California a few years ago and who is facing an endless loop of the temporary contract/hiring freeze game, I don't think people outside of education get it. I mean, if I had a special education credential of any kind I may have a lot of choices. If I were credentialed to teach Spanish, too. \n\nI'm really frustrated because I am SO overqualified with over 20 years of experience, awards, achievements, blah blah blah, and I WANT to teach EL newcomers which has historically been a difficult position to fill, but there is ZIP out there that I am credentialed to teach. And people are like \"simply move,\" as if I can just uproot my entire family's life. \n\nI really, really don't want to sub and I really, really don't want to teach at a charter. Hell, even charters and private schools are pretty dry right now. Declining enrollment has me pretty bummed out. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to commiserate with anyone in the same situation. I thought I was done hustling and grinding with a more stable job, but here I am with 21 years of experience and a master's degree sadly applying to charters an hour away and sadly looking at the meager salary of online ESL teachers.",

    "title": "What's your unpopular opinion about teaching? Things you think but can't exactly say in a staff meeting?",
    "text": "I'm unsure if my opinions are unpopular, but these are things I've encountered during my time working in schools.\n\n1) Getting a teaching job is actually pretty hard.  I think it's a competitive field.  Having a Masters degree increases your chances heavily instead of just having a BA+credenital especially when it comes to good districts.\n\n2) First year teachers struggle with classroom management because they're creating a lot of lesson plans / units / curriculum from scratch.  It's very hard not to have down time as a first year teacher and the down time is what makes kids behaviors go sideways.  You're also trying to figure out what lessons have a high buy and and what lessons just flop from the jump.  All the routine, discapline and structure in the world isn't going to mean anything if you can't keep those kids meaningfully busy everyday.\n\n3) Department chairs and veteran teachers typically have the easiest classes.  New teachers are typically stuck with the remedial freshman who are bouncing off the walls.  My department chair taught 12th grade honors classes.  She was always heavily praised for how great her classroom management was, but her kids were all very well behaved and self motivated / college bound.  I think she was kind of oblivious to what our new guy was going through with his inclusion classes.\n\n4) Subbing isn't a good way to get in the door.  I've met a lot of credentialed subs who were passed over for contracted positions.  I also think long term subbing is a scam with all the work of teaching with half of the pay.\n\n5) Cellphones fried attention spans, but I think the real reason why there's so much apathy in teenagers nowadays is because school doesn't equal money anymore.  A lot of their parents and older siblings have student loan debts and are working low paying jobs.  Naturally they look at that and look at school as being outdated.\n\n6) Chatgpt and AI are going to get stronger and stronger in the next few years.  Every person I've met who works in tech is heavily confident that AI is going to completely change how we use the internet here very soon.  Google is 100 percent all in, and telling juniors and seniors to not use it is like telling them to take a horse and buggy to school instead of a car.\n\nI think there should be classes on how to use and navigate AI.  I spent the summer messing around with chat GPT and it's insanity on what it's capable of doing.  It can do a week's worth of graduate level research in 5 seconds with pinpoint accuracy.\n\n7) Coteaching doesn't work well.  It's usually one person doing all the lesson planning, teaching and grading while the other person sort of just sits there and maybe circulates here and there.  Ironically my coteacher was the most apahetic student I've had: always came in tardy, scrolled on his phone and dipped out a few minutes early.  I don't remember him actually teaching anything.  I felt resentful that he was getting paid the same salary I was without...really doing anything?  The weirdest thing was: I was struggling so much with this inclusion class that I complained to the head of the SPED department on the coteacher saying he wasn't helping and would just scroll all period.  She said \"Sounds like you need to learn how to motivate him more.\"  WHY THE FUCK IS IT MY JOB TO MOTIVATE A SALARIED THIRTY YEAR OLD?\n\n8) Some teachers are control freaks to an unhealthy level.  I'm unsure if this field attracts that personality type of if they become that way over time from this job.  I period subbed for this lady's government class during my prep.  I had a brainfart moment and told the kids to answer questions 1-4 when in reality she wanted them to answer 1-5.  I didn't notice until the bell rang.  She absolutely blew up my email the next school day acting like I commited a felony.  A piece of me wanted to tell her off, but I like not being fired.\n\n9) Mentor teachers should be paid to take on a student teacher.  I also think they should be trained on how to support a student teacher.  The lady I was placed with refused to give up any control at all and it was almost impossible to do the things I had to do for the TPA.  Those 4 months were absolutely stressful.\n\n10) The kids make or break this job.  If you work with good kids you connect with, teaching can be hillarious, fun, rewarding and even easy at times.  One year the kids were a total breeze and I truly felt like I was stealing money from this district since my job was so easy.  If the kids are blatanly disrespectful, resentful and rude...it's going to really hurt your mental health.  I put on 40 lbs last year dealing with all the stress. I always get nervous the day before a new school year knowing my fate is decided by the attendance sheet.\n\n11) Schools varry a lot.  There's several high schools in my community and they all seem like they have different vibes / cultures.  People always tell me admin creates the culture, but idk if that's true.  It's definitely very weid how one HS can be an uplifting and fun place while the one a few miles away feels like a prision.\n\n12) Teachers always say how much they love collobrating with other teachers, but everytime I ever asked for something my emails were left on read. I always thought it would be cool to collaborate and do projects with different departments, but I could never get anything to happen.  I kinda just gave up and became an antisocial island even though during the interview process they told me they don't like antisoical islands and like collobrating.\n\n13) I worked at a school with a 5 minute passing period.  The behaviors there were total shit.  I worked at a school with a 9 minute passing period, and the kids and staff seemed a lot less aggetated.  If I was admin, having a longer passing period would be the very first thing I would do for school culture.  Gives us all a breather to get ready for the next class, pee, greet students at the door, decompress / whatever.\n\nWhat are some things you think / noticed?",

    "text": "In some fields the public sector is a springboard to the more lucrative private sector, but not for teachers. Public jobs are more “rewarding” or “moral” while also taking in more than private school teachers, probably less headache. \n\nYou need some forgiveness on med school loans? Be a doctor at the va for a few years, make little money, transition to a private practice, get moolah. Start your career in law as a public defender or prosecutor, get your court room chops, then become a defense lawyer, get money. You’re exchanging the morally rewarding work for money. I’m not shitting on this but it’s just notable. \n\nTeaching doesn’t follow this. Private schools pay dogshit (at least where I am)  even though they cost and take in more money. The only reason I can come up for this is that we live in a historically sexist country and teaching is historically a job more women take on. Anywho this is just an observation.

    "text": "In a new report released by the Arizona Department of Education (ADE), 1,055 teachers have resigned since July 1. More than 4,200 teaching positions remain vacant, with a majority of them being filled by substitutes or other part-time solutions.\n\nIn a poll sent to school districts and charters, of the 4,200 teaching positions that remain vacant, 30% are being covered by long-term substitutes, nearly 24% are filled by existing teachers who are working through their prep or planning time and nearly 23% are covered by “agency temporary personnel,” ADE said. After that, about 1,400 positions remain completely unfilled.\n\nI'm not shocked that AZ is having this issue. Starting salary in a district I began my career in was $34,700. In over 20 years, that starting salary has gone up only $8k. What a joke. If they paid a living wage and treated teachers with respect, then the shortage wouldn't be so large.",

    "text": "Was offered a job in a district that has a good reputation and was low balled for salary. Was told they’d only honor 3yrs of my experience bc I was from another state. This information wasn’t on the district website (or else I wouldn’t have applied) and I’m assuming they’re not honoring more years due to budget cuts. Anyway, I asked if there was any way I could speak to someone in HR to see if we could discuss it since I had the experience that the school/district was looking for and bc I was very interested in the position (the salary that they were offering just wouldn’t work, especially since I was already taking a pay cut in general). The principal explained the next steps in the hiring process, said that someone from HR would call me with the job offer and we could discuss everything. Two days later I get a call from the principal (not HR) saying that she spoke to HR and that they decided to go with a different candidate. It was a huge slap in the face bc I was super excited to work for this district. I know nothing is set in stone until contracts are signed, but there wasn’t an inclination that they’d revoke their verbal offer. It all felt very shady and made me dislike the education field even more than I already do. It’s disgusting how cheap these districts are. And they wonder why teachers are leaving in droves.

    "text": "My entire academic career (K-12), I’ve been considered “gifted” and a good student. I was not disruptive, didn’t earn detentions or harass other students, came to tutoring when I needed it and I got good grades.\n\nWithout fail, I am somehow nearly always grouped up with “bad” kids or kids with learning disabilities/difficulties. This happened more in elementary school, but it’s happened in both high school and elementary school.\n\nIn my ES, for example, I was sat next to a child who was disruptive, rude, and bullied me. He constantly called me names and sometimes got physical. I was a snitch in ES, but I had decent reason. One time he kept trying to copy off my answers and when I told my teacher, her response was, “well, maybe he needs to copy off you.”\n\nIt’s been years since I’ve been in either ES or HS but those experiences of being an unpaid babysitter, aide and secondary teacher have stuck with me.\n\nSo, why, teachers? Why sit clearly disrespectful children with ones who just want to learn?\n\nEdit: Thanks for those mentioning IEPs that require children to be sat near role models. I think that is disgraceful and a disgusting thing to do to a child without their consent.\n\nEdit 2: To those of you who are implying that I wasn’t gifted/intelligent because I could not force my bully to like me/want to learn, I pity every child who ever comes into your classroom.",

It was very detailed and nasty, describing various things I have been doing wrong, and how her children are heavily demotivated for my subject. \n\nI was gutted. The things she described were incredibly twisted and far from the truth and what I stand for as a teacher. I don’t even have any way to defend myself since the e-mail wasn’t addressed to me. I even saw the mom in school that day and she was smiling at me as if nothing had happened and when I told her I’m always available to speak, she showed no interest. \n\nI have been doing anonymous student feedback and never heard about the issues mentioned in the email. I feel so terrible, my teaching reputation has been hindered and I have no way of defending myself. \n\nUpdate: Thanks to everyone for your compassion. I still have a lot of resilience to build. The principal was very reasonable and I had another chance to explain my perspective. She also said she does plan to do observations next school year. She will try to schedule a meeting with the mother in September with me and another person present. My salary will be reduced this month due to this incident, because otherwise she would have to put this into my file.🙄 I foster cats and use a lot of my own money for saving them so thanks to these privileged rich people for reducing my salary to even less🤦‍♀️\n\nUpdate 2: had a meeting with the mom and the principal. It was terrible and full of insults and hate adressed towards me. Clarifying my good intentions was of no help as this was seen just as empty excuses and I was still seen as a villain by the end of the meeting. I cried during most of it and was told to just sit quiet and listen. - that speaking up for myself would actually confirm the bad accusations. The mother also did not want to shake hands with me and gave an evil glare instead. I’m not sure I can do this job, I was planning to slowly transition into tutoring full time but this might be the time to do it.😢",

    "title": "What's your unpopular opinion about teaching? Things you think but can't exactly say in a staff meeting?",
    "text": "I'm unsure if my opinions are unpopular, but these are things I've encountered during my time working in schools.\n\n1) Getting a teaching job is actually pretty hard.  I think it's a competitive field.  Having a Masters degree increases your chances heavily instead of just having a BA+credenital especially when it comes to good districts.\n\n2) First year teachers struggle with classroom management because they're creating a lot of lesson plans / units / curriculum from scratch.  It's very hard not to have down time as a first year teacher and the down time is what makes kids behaviors go sideways.  You're also trying to figure out what lessons have a high buy and and what lessons just flop from the jump.  All the routine, discapline and structure in the world isn't going to mean anything if you can't keep those kids meaningfully busy everyday.\n\n3) Department chairs and veteran teachers typically have the easiest classes.  New teachers are typically stuck with the remedial freshman who are bouncing off the walls.  My department chair taught 12th grade honors classes.  She was always heavily praised for how great her classroom management was, but her kids were all very well behaved and self motivated / college bound.  I think she was kind of oblivious to what our new guy was going through with his inclusion classes.\n\n4) Subbing isn't a good way to get in the door.  I've met a lot of credentialed subs who were passed over for contracted positions.  I also think long term subbing is a scam with all the work of teaching with half of the pay.\n\n5) Cellphones fried attention spans, but I think the real reason why there's so much apathy in teenagers nowadays is because school doesn't equal money anymore.  A lot of their parents and older siblings have student loan debts and are working low paying jobs.  Naturally they look at that and look at school as being outdated.\n\n6) Chatgpt and AI are going to get stronger and stronger in the next few years.  Every person I've met who works in tech is heavily confident that AI is going to completely change how we use the internet here very soon.  Google is 100 percent all in, and telling juniors and seniors to not use it is like telling them to take a horse and buggy to school instead of a car.\n\nI think there should be classes on how to use and navigate AI.  I spent the summer messing around with chat GPT and it's insanity on what it's capable of doing.  It can do a week's worth of graduate level research in 5 seconds with pinpoint accuracy.\n\n7) Coteaching doesn't work well.  It's usually one person doing all the lesson planning, teaching and grading while the other person sort of just sits there and maybe circulates here and there.  Ironically my coteacher was the most apahetic student I've had: always came in tardy, scrolled on his phone and dipped out a few minutes early.  I don't remember him actually teaching anything.  I felt resentful that he was getting paid the same salary I was without...really doing anything?  The weirdest thing was: I was struggling so much with this inclusion class that I complained to the head of the SPED department on the coteacher saying he wasn't helping and would just scroll all period.  She said \"Sounds like you need to learn how to motivate him more.\"  WHY THE FUCK IS IT MY JOB TO MOTIVATE A SALARIED THIRTY YEAR OLD?\n\n8) Some teachers are control freaks to an unhealthy level.  I'm unsure if this field attracts that personality type of if they become that way over time from this job.  I period subbed for this lady's government class during my prep.  I had a brainfart moment and told the kids to answer questions 1-4 when in reality she wanted them to answer 1-5.  I didn't notice until the bell rang.  She absolutely blew up my email the next school day acting like I commited a felony.  A piece of me wanted to tell her off, but I like not being fired.\n\n9) Mentor teachers should be paid to take on a student teacher.  I also think they should be trained on how to support a student teacher.  The lady I was placed with refused to give up any control at all and it was almost impossible to do the things I had to do for the TPA.  Those 4 months were absolutely stressful.\n\n10) The kids make or break this job.  If you work with good kids you connect with, teaching can be hillarious, fun, rewarding and even easy at times.  One year the kids were a total breeze and I truly felt like I was stealing money from this district since my job was so easy.  If the kids are blatanly disrespectful, resentful and rude...it's going to really hurt your mental health.  I put on 40 lbs last year dealing with all the stress. I always get nervous the day before a new school year knowing my fate is decided by the attendance sheet.\n\n11) Schools varry a lot.  There's several high schools in my community and they all seem like they have different vibes / cultures.  People always tell me admin creates the culture, but idk if that's true.  It's definitely very weid how one HS can be an uplifting and fun place while the one a few miles away feels like a prision.\n\n12) Teachers always say how much they love collobrating with other teachers, but everytime I ever asked for something my emails were left on read. I always thought it would be cool to collaborate and do projects with different departments, but I could never get anything to happen.  I kinda just gave up and became an antisocial island even though during the interview process they told me they don't like antisoical islands and like collobrating.\n\n13) I worked at a school with a 5 minute passing period.  The behaviors there were total shit.  I worked at a school with a 9 minute passing period, and the kids and staff seemed a lot less aggetated.  \n\nWhat are some things you think / noticed?",

WHY? why the living heck would I do anything right at the end of my career.\n\nNow I am going to have to go to the Principal and defend myself against a student who is mad because she is not graduating when she wanted to. Mind you, she is not graduating because she still has a number of classes to take, but I am thinking that she believes it is all my fault.\n\nI am just venting. I know nothing is going to come of this and that the entire thing is going to turn out to be nothing, but it still is a crappy way to end my career. I am too old and too tired to deal with this crud any more.\n\n  \nUPDATE: The student has been moved out of my room. I am not going to have ANY interactions with her and things are settled.

    "title": "Should I become a high school teacher?",
    "text": "I’m 23 with a bachelors in Economics (3.1 GPA) and have a corporate sales/analyst job making under 6 figures. I am looking at my future options, and the corporate ones in my field either require a graduate degree or significant progress climbing the corporate ladder, which seems harder and harder as time goes on but does have higher salary upside.\n\nMy main reasoning for looking into high school teaching is twofold. The first is that I enjoy working with people who are facing a problem, especially if they are reluctant to learn from me or are stuck in their ways in general. I’ve worked with children and young adults in a tutoring capacity that isn’t directly relatable to teaching of course, but my interest in teaching is certainly there and so is my level of patience, and not to mention I am more than okay, closer to impressed with high school teacher salary.\n\nThe second is that high school teaching seems to be a somewhat reliable way for me to invest in myself through graduate degrees. The school systems near me (NJ) all have, after your first year of teaching, a $50,000 / year tuition reimbursement system. To me, this seems like a more reliable (but not easy) way for me to earn my graduate degrees with 1-2 classes each semester during the school year and more during the summers, though I don’t know how “free” these summers actually are for teachers, as much as most people like to hype them up.\n\nThis will help me earn a masters and PhD (hopefully) within 10-15 years which I will use to either become a college professor (a dream job of mine, though I understand how hard it is to actually get that job) or work in a corporate/federal setting in my field (economics) in a consulting or an analyst related role.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI am a 23 year old male with a bachelors in economics with a 3.1 GPA. \n\nI am looking at high school teaching as more of a work-study type program where I can get my grad degrees while working and receive tuition reimbursement, while earning a wage I could be content with.\n\nI see this as a 10-15 year plan as I get my masters and PhD in either Economics or Statistics. I do not see this directly as my long term career, but more of a 10-15 year job to begin my career and progress towards either becoming a college professor or a better corporate position as either a consultant or analyst. From there, it would also be nice to have teaching as a fallback option once I’ve already put 10-15 years into the stepwise teacher salary schedule.\n\n\nMain questions I’d like answered if possible:\n\nWhat are you main stressors in high school level teaching?\n\nAre the summers really “time off”? I understand some need a part time job, but assume for this case that I will not. Will I have enough time to get my graduate degrees?\n\nIs the tuition reimbursement all it’s chalked up to be? Or is there a catch?\n\nAnd finally, if you were in my shoes, would you take the risk and stick it out with corporate and maybe get an MBA down the line to advance your career, or would you work more directly toward graduate degrees while working in a high school teaching setting, assuming that’s even possible?\n\n\nThank you very much for reading this far or even at all, I truly appreciate any and all help with this decision.\n\n\n",

It tells the real story of how Brad Cohen, the teacher with Tourette’s syndrome became one of the best teachers that the students and staff loved and admired. \n\nFrom fiction to nonfiction, these teachers are what I aspired to be… the teacher I never had.\nI guess reality had to remind me that just because your passionate about Math not everyone will share that same enthusiasm. \n\nEspecially people who don’t seem to have a fundamental understanding of the basic four operations. \n\nWhen people decide to pursue teaching as a career, maybe someone should have added a disclaimer stating that in America you are 95% disciplining students and 5% teaching if any percent at all. Essentially teaching is baby sitting with a salary and you get the added benefit of administration and parents that don’t treat you as a human being.\n\nI have been to multiple job fairs for school districts and decided to be honest and transparent with the recruiter or principal that was there. It turns out that the saying “ The truth will set you free.” is wrong in the sense of job hunting. So I guess lying really well must be the way up the food chain and if you have a reference or two that speaks highly of you that can help. \n\nTeaching is treasured and honored in other countries. Just do a quick Google search and you will see what I mean. \n\nI guess what I’m trying to say here is that the United States culture of education is wrong and broken. Many people of old in the past have stated similar thoughts of the matter yet no one listened. \n\nThe funny thing about this is that if you were to Google search The Great Resignation, especially talking about education is this term anywhere else in the world?\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nDo you know why that is the case? Couple of reasons emerge one reason is that the culture understands education doesn’t start from school it starts from home. The only thing school should be is a reinforcing ground for positive behaviors but now it is a festering ground full of negative and destructive behaviors. \n\nI understand why this is still happening. So I guess the best thing to do is be like the Lorax…Unless…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "I am a first year teacher who really needs some help. I teach in a private Christian school that is run by a pastor with no education background, he was previously a police officer. He is extremely political and is very outwardly unfriendly if someone chooses to not speak about their political opinions. I have a rule that I don't talk politics at work even if I agree with it, it just isn't something I like to do, and it bothers him that I won't speak on my opinions like the other teachers do. He often tells me I'm just too liberal. Just to reiterate... I have never once spoken on anything political with anyone I work with and I don't put anything political on my social media.\n\nThere have been five incidents this year in which he has come to me and said that \"the board\" is unhappy with me and that they don't believe I can/am do(ing) my job. After speaking with multiple members of the board I have discovered this has never once been brought up in discussion and that no-one would even agree with the sentiment. My students all improved this year in their state testing scores as well as their end of course exams; I am proud of them, and for sure know that he was never once correct in saying any of that to me. He went so far as to say that the board would be bringing in a new teacher for the final quarter to do a writing workshop with the kids because they weren't confident in me. This was also a lie, she is the teacher who will be taking over for me next year and since all of our students have 3 study halls daily (yes, literally 3 study halls every single day) she requested to come in and do anything with them to help get them through the day and to get to know them. He agreed to do this BUT only if he could completely remove my middle school students from my class and have them solely work with the new teacher. This was shot down by the principal as well as myself because we were in the middle of reading books together and it wasn't fair to just end the projects they were doing and give them zeros, which is what he requested that I do. So he agreed to allow them to do the writing workshop during one of their multiple study halls.\n\nWell now it's the end of the year and this new teacher has dozens of assignments that need to be graded and put into the grade book for students' transcripts. I have been informed that she will be grading them and that I would be responsible for putting the grades in under my name. I have completely refused as it is unethical for me to put those grades in as if I was the one who did them. I have never even seen the assignments. I also don't know if that's even legal to do. My grade book has already been closed and recorded for the past week. Is this something they can make me do? If I refuse to do it can he revoke the rest of my salary and not pay it out over the summer? How do I go about getting the borderline harassment from my boss to end? I still have a few months left in my contract.",
