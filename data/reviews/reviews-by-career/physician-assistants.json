You can attend a highly respected university, excel academically, gain admission to a PA program with a 3-4% acceptance rate, study 70 hours a week for two years, complete a fellowship—and still have less practice authority, fewer job opportunities, and lower pay than an NP who completed their entire education at Chamberlain or Walden.\n\nI also resent the focus on “clinical hours performed” as if that even begins to capture the difference. The acceptance rate alone creates a drastically different labor pool before the educational differences even begin. On top of that, PA programs provide a much more rigorous didactic education—even compared to NPs from Ivy League brick-and-mortar schools.\n\nMany of us chose this profession because we thought we would enjoy it, but the job market doesn’t reflect the value we bring. Instead, it rewards the opposite, which is incredibly disheartening. And nothing seems likely to change.\n\nSad state of affairs. Any thoughts from my fellow PAs?",

    "text": "I have a casual position I pick up shifts at. They finally hired someone for a position they had been struggling to fill (undesirable hours) and I’ve worked with the NP who will be taking over 3x now. \n\nI’ll preface this by saying she is a genuinely nice person and I do like her as a person. I think she means well. I also have worked with many NPs who are competent and good at their jobs. \n\nBut “Susie” as we will call her, is not. She went to an online diploma mill for her NP school and although she has 20 years of RN experience, it doesn’t seem to help her much. She doesn’t know just the complete basics of care - everything from how to write a SOAP note (or how to even formulate an assessment and plan) to how to diagnose conditions, prescribe medications, just… anything. She can perform the mechanics of an exam but doesn’t seem to understand/recognize when there are abnormal findings (or when there are normal findings that are not abnormal). Even the questions she asks me make zero sense - instead of “45 yo M presenting with xyz, my ddx is abc, anything you would add?” Or whatever, it is “what should I put as my diagnosis in the computer?” (But she barely gives me any context.. where does she think the diagnosis comes from??) or “what should I write in the A/P?” I mean… your assessment and plan??\n\nI thought maybe it was nervousness at first and things would improve. But it’s been about 2 months and I’m not sure anymore. We had a patient come in interested in birth control and she asked me what she should do. I had to walk her through everything, from what history she should gather to how to decide what product to order. \n\nThe kicker is she will be working SOLO at this clinic once her “training period” is over - which will be over in a few weeks. I just don’t think her practicing solo is safe for these patients! Many of them are uninsured or underinsured to make things worse, so it’s not like she can easily refer everything out (not that that’s a great solution in the first place)\n\nMy mind is just boggled as I genuinely did not know there was an institution of higher education that would give someone an NP degree who has such little knowledge about practicing medicine! I have heard of the “diploma mills” but thought they were exaggerated tbh. \n\nI can see why physicians who work with someone like this might be horrified to work with any PA/NP in the future! \n\nI think at the minimum she needs to work somewhere where other physicians or experienced PAs/NPs are. She does have experience as an NP apparently (not in primary care) but I don’t understand what she was doing previously, as surely it required her to formulate a basic note. \n\nAnyway. Just had to vent. Feeling discouraged to even be a PA or “APP” after this experience. I think these schools should be shut down, they honestly take advantage of people and make everyone look bad. Our supervising physician came by to “visit” and I have never seen him in all my time working there, so I think someone has made him aware of the situation. He privately asked me my thoughts on her and sat in on her visits. He didn’t seem happy, but I can’t blame him. Thank goodness our institution requires supervision - I know there will always be docs who just sign their name and don’t care, but he does seem to genuinely care and in this case it really does matter that he does. \n\nJust.. ick. I hate the direction medicine is going. \n\n\n\n",

    "text": "This is my first ever post on Reddit. Today, I had a patient who was truly awful and one of the worst encounters I’ve ever had and I just need to feel I’m not alone in these experiences! \n\n(For reference, I’ve been working in a dermatology clinic independently as the sole provider for 3 years now and for a total of 7 years:)\n\nI walk into the room and introduce myself. Immediately I could tell she was going to be awful by the way she sneered and looked me up and down. She told me in a very matter of fact way that she’d had granuloma annulare before, years ago, and it was back. She then proceeded to demand I treat it with “naprosyn” because she read about it online. “Naproxen?” I say. And she leans forward and it the most condescending manner says “No, not naproxen, Narcan. Do you know what Narcan is? “I asked do you mean nalaxone?”  “Yesss naloxone” she says, exasperated like somehow I’m an idiot when she was saying the wrong medication! I let her know very politely I wasn’t aware it could be used to treat this condition but I would certainly research it. She got agitated saying “ OH the research is there.” So I tell her more about the nature of the rash and then she proceeds to insist that it was caused by trauma she had to her lower leg or a vaccine. I just nodded and said the cause of this rash is unknown, and she got more agitated that I wouldn’t agree it was caused by her fall or a vaccine. I just said I’m sorry I can’t speak on what may of caused it in your case, it’s associated with x, y, z, etc. She goes back to asking about systemic drugs for it, I tell her none are approved, I typically treat with topicals and light box, she wasn’t having it. So I said well if you’re insistent on systemic therapy I need to do a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. \nAfter the biopsy and I go through the follow up timeline etc , she asks “and who does the skin checks here” - “I do mam, you can schedule an appointment on the way out” she said “No, we can do it NOW” and then asked well “then where’s the doctor” I said there is no doctor on site, if you’re uncomfortable with that you’re welcome to pursue care elsewhere (and I WISH I had a dermatologist on site - but in my area this is few and far between) \n\nMy blood was boiling!! I never feel mad like this with patients. I calmly explained no, we had exceeded the allotted time for her visit, this was scheduled for a rash, she needed to reschedule OR if she wanted to wait, I told her I’d see her after I saw the remainder of my patients. She huffed and asking well how long will THAT be? \n\nI just don’t know why I chose a career where I have to put up with this type of behavior from people - to be disrespected and just have to grin and bear it. To be looked down upon because I’m not an M.D. (totally fine with me, I have utmost respect for M.D.s and don’t resent I’m not one or pretend to know everything they do) when they knew I was a PA when they scheduled the appointment ahead of time!! I could’ve pursued a different masters program that wouldn’t have this end result. \n\nIt was so degrading. She was so condescending, rude, mean. I’m over it. \n\nI want out of patient care. \n\nCan anyone else relate? \n#rantover \n\n\n\n",

Every job I’ve had they push seeing more patients, longer hours, and they get rid of your ancillary support bc of “budget cuts”. No one ever cares to look for the root cause of symptoms it’s just sending in more medications to mask things. I’m so over it.\n\nI found a 100% remote job outside of medicine that I accepted and I’m happy I’m leaving a field I hate.

    "text": "Forever ago when I was a little PA-S, I had a fairly grueling trauma rotation. For six weeks we did five 12-14 hour shifts, on our feet the whole time (we ate while walking the hallways, without exaggeration), and once a week we spent the night and got no real sleep and did post call the next day (once my resident woke me up after 45 minutes of bliss-filled uncomfortable napping on the sad on call room bed - we went down to the trauma bay and it was an obviously non-surgical, drunk guy who hit his head. \"What'd you wake me up for?\" I asked the young doctor. \"Hey man, someone has to check rectal tone!\").\n\n  \nMy preceptor, a hardened trauma attending, was one bad SOB but man the guy must've got burned by somebody somewhere. After we did our 24 hour shift and rounded for post call he'd take me, another sad PA-S, and a couple residents to the conference room and lecture us on the worst stuff possible, like IL-6 and cytokine release. Man you're a board certified trauma surgeon, do you really need to teach this stuff? The room was always a cozy 72 degrees too while the rest of the hospital was always too hot or freezing cold. And if whoever was post call that day fell asleep while he lectured, he'd make an example out of them.\n\nWell all along as a PA-S and on my emergency medicine rotation, the ER docs always had this little spiel where they said, \"You know what separates us from ALL the other doctors?\" *You have no circadian rhythm either, I thought?* \"Other doctors think 'what's the most likely diagnosis.' We think 'what's most likely to kill my patient?'\" You hear this over and over as a PA-S. It's like the most clever thing an ER guy ever said or something. But when they ask for the fifth time you just say \"no, what?\" because they love to tell you the answer.\n\nSo there I was, eyes barely open, drool in corner of the mouth, waiting for this lecture to end after my turn at post call rounds so I could drive back home and hope I fell asleep at the wheel so a semitruck would put me out of my misery. When my preceptor, the trauma attending, asked,\n\n\"Do you know what separates us from ER doctors?\"\n\nOh God, I thought. This is it. The pinnacle of bad-assery in medicine. Because I already knew how ER docs thought, and now I was dying to know how trauma docs thought. My last four brain cells rallied to keep one eyelid open as I waited in eager anticipation to hear.\n\n\"ER doctors think 'what's the most likely diagnosis.' We think 'what's most likely to kill my patient?'\"\n\nI closed my eyes and put my head down on that cold, hard conference room table. Let him yell at me.

    "text": "This is not just a one time thing, but I’ve actually seen it on NP program curriculums, websites, NP forum here on reddit, and other various online sources that many NP programs only allow preceptors to be “NP or physician” it may initially seem insignificant (which in the grand scheme it is), but it really shows you NP programs and AANP’s true colors. They genuinely believe they’re above PAs to the point that some/many programs don’t let their students be precepted by PAs. It’s honestly hilarious and so delusional. If they believe NP = physician so much we PAs should honestly all stop precepting NP students overall. They already have a hard time getting preceptors. I just am never surprised anymore by the audacity of NPs. Truly tho, the one thing nurses know how to do is talk up about how amazing they are and better than everyone else. Their self confidence is literally out of this world. \n\nThis is not an attack on NPs at the individual level but moreso how the NP profession tries to poise itself as God’s gift to patients. \n\nHere is an example of a very misinformed and indoctrinated NP in the comments. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/s/S2AXHpztPF\n\nShe says NPs are “more specialized”, “more qualifed”, since “most NPs have a DNP” (which ~14% is not most NPs) and due to nursing lobby really fighting for FPA makes “NPs better to precept PAs”. I’m telling y’all THESE are the kinds of NPs the online NP diploma mills are producing. These NPs then go online to social media where they spew this baseless and incorrect rhetoric to everyone who then believes it because they’re a “nurse”. \n\nShe also said PAs are “med school flunkies” and NPs are better because they went into “advanced nursing”. She MUST be trolling. \n\nThis NEEDS to be a wake up call for PAs. I’m sure there are great NPs out there, but the batches they are churning out now are just awful and have an unfounded superiority complex.

    "text": "I’ve gone back and forth on the issue of independent practice rights for PAs over the years, but I’ve come to fully support it, and here’s why.\n\nFor the past decade, “supervision” has been mostly symbolic. In most of my jobs, it has meant a physician signs a form when I get hired, and that’s the end of their involvement. I’m the one seeing patients, making clinical decisions, prescribing, ordering tests, and managing follow ups. If I need help, I consult, just like any competent provider would. But the idea that I legally need a supervising physician when they’re not actively involved in my decisions just doesn’t reflect reality.\n\nAdministrators have had far more influence over my clinical decisions than any of the physicians listed as my supervisor. I’ve worked in urgent care, primary care, and rural medicine, and in all of those settings I’ve been expected to carry my own load and manage my own patients. I am responsible for outcomes, and I carry malpractice insurance at the same level as the physicians I work with.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is that if I ever wanted to open my own practice, I would have to pay a physician I may not even know to be listed as my “supervisor.” That arrangement doesn’t benefit patient care. It’s just a regulatory hurdle that restricts PAs from growing professionally.\n\nI totally get that not all fields are the same. In most specialties or high acuity settings, supervision and structured oversight are appropriate. But in general practice, I’ve already been functioning independently for years.\n\nNurse practitioners in many states already have full practice authority, and that is never going to be undone. There’s no reason experienced PAs shouldn’t have the same opportunity. Independent practice does not mean working in a silo. It means practicing with autonomy while still collaborating when needed, just like every other clinician.\n\nIt’s time to recognize what’s already happening in the real world.\n\nAnd to the bitter, underpaid residents on Noctor who love to hate on PAs and NPs: I get it. You’re exhausted, buried in debt, and watching someone make more than you while working fewer hours feels infuriating. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel for you. Once you’re done, you’ll have the autonomy, the income, and the recognition that you’ve worked so hard for.\n\nAs for me, I didn’t have the luxury of going straight through undergrad and into med school. I grew up poor. I was in my 30s retaking science classes while working full-time just to get into PA school. Med school wasn’t an option for me, financially or logistically. I chose the path that was possible, and I’ve built a career I’m proud of.\n\nSo no, I’m not trying to be a doctor. I’m a PA. And like many others in this profession, I’m just asking for the right to practice at the level I’ve already been working at for years, with honesty, accountability, and independence.\n",

    "title": "Some quick tips if you want to maximize income as a PA",
    "text": "I've worked in several specialties as a PA for over a decade. This is just a quick pointer for newer PAs given some of the \"compare job offer posts\" we've been getting lately, to help some of you guys steer away from these bogus 100-110 offers we are seeing lately. \n\n#####\n\nONE: Do your research. So, there is a huge variability in PA pay between cities, states, and specialties. While some cities are quite obviously over saturated (you can spot them because they're HCOL and the only job postings are family medicine and urgent care) and some places obviously will pay a lot (super rural, or inner city hospitals in states that aren't considered popular to live in), there is often LITTLE predictability in this. So do your research! Look up salary reports both APAA and whatever Google spits out. No it's not reliable but it's a starting point. Then look for recruiters in your job market, make an email account specific for this and don't give out your cell. Recruiters will often tell you salary ranges before you interview, so this is another way to learn the market. Ask other PAs you know in private some will share numbers. Finally, you can interview at spots and turn them down if you literally have no other way to get market insight. \n\n\n#####\n\nTWO: Apply broadly. If you aren't limited by geography, apply in cities that interest you. Look at cost of living, school districts, things to do. If you're willing to move, sky is the limit on salary. Even if not, apply broadly locally. Some major hospitals only post jobs on their career page but otherwise use indeed, Google jobs, doc cafe, zip recruiter as some places don't post universally. If you have connections use them cuz some positions don't get posted at all. Big hospitals have their own recruiters. Ask them what positions pay the best, if any are in critical need of a PA they often pay above market value for those positions. \n\n#####\n\nI've done multiple specialties and my advice is find the right schedule, pay, and group of people to work with and you can be happy. Don't pigeon hole yourself into one specialty. Every specialty has its pros and cons and anywhere you will learn stuff that transfers universally. Plus getting 1-2 subspecialties on your CV will make you a lot more attractive to employers. \n\n#####\n\nTHREE: go on multiple interviews. Grill potential employers on non financial details of the job like what's a typical day, how often are you out late, how many patients a day, do you get your own MA if it's clinic, how many PAs have they hired and what's the retention on them, etc. If you're forgetful write the info down once you get to your car. But DON'T talk money on an interview. If they ask what your last job paid just say you'd have to check to be sure etc. \n\n#####\n\nFOUR: try to get at least 3-4 offers. Ask every. single. one. if they negotiate. Most will. Make a document comparing all jobs. Convert PTO into a dollar amount. Write down major pros and cons of each job and rank them how bad you want them if money wasn't an issue. Write down red flags and commute time as well. \n\n#####\n\nIf they do negotiate, go to your highest offer, write that dollar amount down. Let's say 160K. Go back to the other employers and say \"I really want to take this job however I had another employer offer a more competitive financial package.\" They're gonna ask what it was. Add 10K or whatever to your best offer so let's say 170K and see what they counter with. \n\n#####\n\nIf they match it, you can maybe go even higher. Tell them you took that to the first employee (the one who offered you 160, which you claimed was 170), and now they offered you 180. See what happens. Keep pitting your offers against each other til they say no more. Then go back to your document and update the salary for everyone. \n\n#####\n\nFIVE: finally after all this, do not make your decision based on money alone. Go back to how you ranked the offers based on if they all paid equal. The best job may be in the middle, say number 2 for pay and 2 for what you want. Or maybe not. But at least this way you've got the best financial offers you can. \n\n#####\n\nSIX: don't take the literal first offer you get. A lot of employers take a month just to review your CV so have a little patience if no one is biting early on. If you're desperate for cash you can always do urgent care since they don't care (usually) about retention anyway. I say this maybe half jokingly. But regardless, if you do take one of these 110K jobs, every six months or so re evaluate the market. \n\n#####\n\nGood luck out there. Remember it is very difficult to become a PA. We offer a significant service unparalleled by most other professions in skill besides doctors and of course. We accept a lot of emotional baggage at work and huge liability. Don't sell yourself short and don't let yourself get taken advantage of. It's ok to take a low paying job if you want but at least make an effort not to unless you're already financially set because that extra money is going somewhere and it isn't patient pockets. ",

    "text": "1. There is a hierarchy in medicine but you don’t need to espouse it. The nurses, MAs, clerical staff, MDs, etc are all part of the same team. Make sure that you show that you value them and treat with equal respect.\n\n2. Be a sponge for knowledge. The first few years of our first job is “our residency”. I always tell students who are applying to jobs that the most important questions are:\n     A. Who will be responsible for training me and how long will my onboarding last?\n     B. What feedback will I be receiving along the way to know that I am on track to being a full member of the team?\nThe best first position to accept is not the one that pays you the most and is not necessarily in your favorite specialty. It is where your training will continue best.\n\n3. There is no downtime at work. If you have a free moment then read on UpToDate about conditions your patients have.\n\n4. Find a mentor if you are not assigned one. That person should have high expectations for themself and others, lots of experience, and a passion for their job.\n\n5. When you refer a patient to a consultant, make the phone call and ask questions about the work up that will ensure. Learning from consultants is better than any book.\n\n6. In the hospital setting, go to procedures with your patients. Have a radiologist read your CT or plain film. Have a cardiologist review an echo with you.\n\n7. RNs are the frontline of healthcare. Healthcare does not exist without them. They are as much your teachers as are your colleague APPs and supervising physicians.\n\n8. It is always ok to say “I don’t know but I will go find the answer to your question.” No one came out of the womb knowing medicine. It is not weakness to ask for help. It is a strength.\n\n9. I got baited by a malignant MD on this sub Reddit. Don’t be baited by anyone who is malignant. Spending time with patients and listening is not about making them feel warm and fuzzy. It is about empowering them and making them feel heard. Our patients too are our teachers. 17 years in I am still learning from them.",

    "title": "AAPA salary report is a leash keeping PAs humble since... forever?",
    "text": "The PA Salary Report is that ex you still text even though he wrecked your car, stole your dog, and somehow still has the nerve to send you a \"you up?\" at 11:47 PM.\n\nI’ve been a PA for 3 years and at this point, I’m convinced AAPA report is ruining our lives. \n\nHear me out....its ruining us not in some abstract way. It's screwing us in real life, In our bank accounts, tax bracket where you remain to be making just enough to get no help but not enough to ever afford more help.\n\nMy first job paid 125K. I was fresh out of school. It felt good. wRVU bonus sprinkled on top...I thought I was on my way to greatness. Year two rolls around... still 125K. Bonus? Vanished! Ghosted! When I asked, they blinked like I’d just told them I wanted to start doing surgeries...“You’re already in the upper tier of PA salaries” they told me.\n\nUpper tier? Bruh, I drive a car that needs prayer, patience, and a floor tap to turn on AC when I need it...which is every single day in Texas!\n\nShockingly (not really) every single clinic I’ve interviewed at since says the exact same thing! The moment I mention I want “135K base and a quarterly bonus,” you can see them glitching! Their pupils blow up like they just spotted a chart with no vitals... PA Salary Report has opened in their head like a mental CT scan..w and w/o oral contrast! They smirk at my audacity before they start putting me back in my place\n\nI can hear their inner monologue:  \n“LOL at your AUDACITY, you peasant!!! HOW DARE YOU! You… little stethoscope-wielding gremlin. You thought your value goes up with experience, just 3 yr of experience? Have you not seen those before you, the ones with 5+ years of experience sitting gratefully at 125k...YOU Fool. You are not here to grow. You are here to pre-chart, over-chart, re-chart and keep charting to cross that milli, turn it into a billi, do more refill fluconazole, and die quietly at your desk…and while dying, make sure you remind yourself how lucky you are to be making 3 figures right out of PA school! You’re not the captain of the ship. You are the The Groom of the Stool... The one who empties the urine bucket wipes captain/king after he takes a dump..you are important to a degree just like THE GROOM OF THE STOOL is/was (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom\\_of\\_the\\_Stool)\n\nThe AAPA report was supposed to help us. Instead, it gave every clinic owner and admin a number to weaponize. It’s not a benchmark anymore. It’s a trap. You hit that number, and suddenly asking for a raise feels like demanding Jeff Bezos’ yacht.\n\nAnd you know who isn’t living like this?  \nDerm PAs. The chosen ones. They escaped. They have their own subreddit now. They’re getting paid for productivity, procedures, lasers, fillers, botox, maybe even inner peace because of financial security. Good for them. They figured it out.\n\nOver here, someone with eight years of experience is clapping for 140K like they just got a full ride to Harvard. That’s not okay. If you're ten years in, doing specialty work, managing patients, and still showing up with clean scrubs and semi-functioning eye contact, you should be making more than a derm shave biopsy every 10 minutes.\n\nAs a new grad, I wanted to “do real medicine” but then real bills happened. Now I’m not poor enough for food stamps and not rich enough to buy a new HONDA Civic without another loan. I hate loans…I don’t want more loans… right now I'm just stuck in the middle, watching my student loans age like fine wine.\n\nFew months back when I was low key job hunting, didn't put my resignation yet- I met a PA who had slithered his way to become a manager. He offered me a position: 15 solo night shifts a month (how generous), 12hr each, No PTO, MD available \"by phone.\"...Pay? 140K and that already included night differential.  After this amazing offer, with dead eyes of someone whose soul left during managerial training, he says,  \n“We’re hoping you’ll pick up extra night shifts and you will remain nights for at-least 1 year”\n\nSir… you are not a manager.  \nYou are a marrow suppression event.\n\nAnd of course he closed with the sacred line every trash offer comes with:  \n“That’s not the usual salary for someone with two years out”\n\nNo. Just no.\n\nBurn that line. Burn the report. Burn the spreadsheet.  \nIf AAPA doesn’t lock that report or burn it and then flush it down the toilet, we’re all gonna be trapped in hellish time loop where every day is Monday, the coffee machine is broken, and the pt wants abx “just in case.” for his viral infx\n\n**P.S.** I know some pre-PAs and PA students are lurking here as I once did, scrolling reddit posts thinking,  \n“OMG what is wrong with this PA… she is soooo ungrateful. 125K?? That’s AHHMAZING! I’d cry tears of joy for that.”\n\nAnd I get it. I really do. I was you. But here’s what u don’t know…\n\nWhen that 125K doesn’t move after 3 years. When you’ve maxed out your learning curve in your field… When your schedule is full, the collection reports keep climbing to milli, and instead of a raise or even a gift card, they hire two more NPs to triple the clinic income while you just... keep swimming?\n\nYou realize something dark, u have officially maxed out, not because you’re not growing, but because the AAPA salary Report told them so.\n\nAnd when financial stagnation hits...It’s a whole new flavor of existential dread because your raise this year was emotional resilience.\n\nIf I were 60yr old, maybe I’d shrug it off. Retirement’s around the corner. But I’m not. I still have to buy a house, pay off loans, maybe own a car that doesn’t start with prayer ;) …\n\nAnyway, to the students, yes 125K is amazing on year 0  \nUntil it isn’t \n\nGood luck out there",

    "text": "  \nI’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with something that I think many of us might relate to: our pay compared to the responsibility and investment it takes to become a PA.\n\nI work in critical care medicine in NYC and have been practicing for the last year. Recently, I found out that my sister, an RN who graduated just 6 months ago, is taking home the same paycheck that I do. We both make about $3,800 every two weeks after tax—with no overtime for either of us. The difference? I went through graduate school, invested nearly $200K in my education, and carry a very different scope of responsibility. She completed an accelerated nursing program for a fraction of the cost.\n\nOn top of that:\n\n* She earns **1.5x overtime** pay for extra shifts, while I only get a flat \\~$20/hr increase for PRN shifts.\n* She gets a **pension**, while I do not.\n* She has scheduled breaks, while I rarely do.\n* And she works in a suburban area with much lower cost of living, while my NYC rent is almost double hers.\n\nMeanwhile, I see RNs in my own hospital with these same benefits and protections. To be clear—I’m not upset at nurses; they’ve done an incredible job advocating for themselves in NYC, LA, SF, and other metro areas to secure fair, often excellent, compensation. My question is: **how can we as PAs do the same?**\n\nI want to learn from experienced PAs:\n\n* What steps can we take collectively to **elevate our profession** and negotiate for better compensation and benefits?\n* On a personal level, what moves have you made to grow **financially as a PA**—whether through job changes, side work, investing, or even shifting specialties—that made the career more worthwhile for you?\n* Are there organizations or advocacy efforts we should be rallying behind to make sure PAs don’t get left behind in the larger healthcare pay landscape?\n\nI love the work I do, but I need to see a clearer path to financial growth and professional respect.

    "text": "We all know about onboarding &amp; CME… but I’ve come up with a list of real-life hacks, shortcuts and tips that make the chaos of your rookie year more survivable. Like an unofficial cheat sheet.\n\nThis is mostly tailored for acute, inpatient settings (ER, ICU, etc) but honestly everybody can use a few of these.\n\nHere goes: \n\n1. Find your pooping bathroom on Day 1. Not the one on the unit that everyone uses. The one wayyy down the hall in the corner that barely gets any sunlight. It might even be on a different floor. This is more important than your login credentials. \n2. Learn all the nurses’ names ASAP. The good ones will save your ass. The great ones will quietly warn you before you step in shit. \n3. Say hello/good morning/good afternoon to everyone, from custodial staff to other providers. It forces people to look at your face when they otherwise wouldn’t have. Being a familiar face will save you one day … and it’s just good manners.\n4. Especially ER or anything procedure- heavy. Keep one set of backup scrubs in your car. There WILL be blood, vomit, poop, or something unidentifiable and the hospital issued scrubs fit horribly. \n5. Figure out the food situation early on. What is the shortest route to the cafeteria? Where’s the microwave/fridge? Which nurse/provider always has a snack? When do reps bring lunch? This is survival intel.\n6. Learn which attending will actually teach you and which will roast you. Seek the teachers out. They’re worth gold.\n7. Save dot phrases early. If you write something more than twice, turn it into a template or dot phrase. Your future self will thank you.\n8. Identify the gossip triangle and avoid it. Every workplace has one. Stay out of it or you’ll be the topic by Friday.\n9. Similar to the above tip, limit the amount of personal info you share at work. Chat casually, but your coworkers don’t need your entire life story. (Pro tip: being young, childless, or unmarried may make you the “go-to” for short-staffed coverage… reveal details with caution)\n10. Wear layers. Hospitals are hot and cold zones. Sweaters and undershirts are your friends.\n11. Learn what you can delegate early. You’re not a martyr, you’re a provider. Use techs, nurses, RTs. It keeps patients safer. \n12. Similarly, remember you’re NOT too good for anything. You’re not too good to ask for (and OFFER!) help. Don’t let the hierarchy get to your head. At the end of the day, we’re all here to help patients. \n13. Create your own cheat sheet. Common meds with dosages, top 5-10 complaints with management, treatment algorithms, short list of most important phone numbers. I have a one page Word Doc saved to my email that I pull up before even logging into the EMR for the day. You won’t need it after a while but it certainly helps early on.\n14. A really good backpack/work bag, travel mug, and set of pens are worth their weight in gold. \n15. Learn who actually runs the place. Hint: probably not the doctor. Sometimes it’s the charge nurse. It’s usually the unit clerk or front desk lady. \n16. Get comfortable saying “I don’t know.” Faking it gets people hurt.\n17. Know your escape route. Find your spot to cry, to vent, to breathe for 5 minutes. Map it out before you need it. \n18. Pick your battles. You don’t have to fix every broken process on Day 1… as much as we all want to. \n19. Find your “phone-a-friend.” It may be a doctor, it might be another PA. It might be your friend in a totally different state that has experience in the specialty. Have someone you can text about a weird lab value or a scary case without feeling dumb.\n20. Have a post-shift ritual. Especially if you work long blocks in a row (looking at you 7on/off-ers &amp; 12 hour shifters) Find your small thing that signals to your brain that work is over. For me, I listen to the same song on the way home. I’m almost conditioned now. I get SOOOO relaxed when I hear it in the wild. \n\n\nAnd perhaps the most important one… Celebrate regularly. Treat yourself. You’re learning fast &amp; deserve to celebrate. I keep a “mini-win” list for when I get discouraged. \n\n\nYour first year will be chaos, but it’s where you grow the most. Stay humble, stay teachable, and when in doubt: snacks, nurses, and bathrooms are the holy trinity.”",

    "text": "Tldr: my dad's on hospice and his PA used magic unknown words to make him live longer. Thank you also any gift ideas?\n\nMy dad is dying. He's been in rough shape for a while and frankly it'd be a shorter list at this point of what isn't wrong with him. He was put on hospice yesterday and it won't be much longer before he passes.\nFor the last 6± years he's been seeing an endocrine PA for diabetes management, and she has been more amazing than I can begin to describe. She's the only provider he has ever seen regularly and continued to go back to in his entire life. He has no PCP, no cardiologist, no gastro. \nJust her.\n\nMy dad is so deeply hard headed you cannot tell him a damn thing he doesn't want to do and you can't make him understand the importance of those things. I work in health care I explain test results and follow up care to people all day long. I'm really goddamn good at health care communication but I could never get through to my dad the way she did. She convinced him to get testing and additional care that he never would have done (even if he never followed up with the other departments again).\nShe single handedly extended my dad's life by years. She gave me so many more good years with him. He got to see me graduate college, get a fiancé, get a good job, and buy a house.\n\nThere will never be a large enough thank you I can give to his PA. I know this job is thankless, taxing, and underpaid but please know the difference you are making in so many lives of people you'll never meet.\nAlso, if you have ideas for gifts I could send in addition to a thank you note, I'd love to hear it ❤️ ",

    "title": "How to be a happy PA: finding the right job and making it work for you",
    "text": "Hello fellow PAs. I've done a few of these guides now and always a ton of fun so thought I'd try my hand again. This is really intended for PAs who 1) feel burnt out at work especially early in the career (and I have noticed a fair amount are in IM and FM) who are interested in potentially changing specialties or jobs, and 2) those who feel bogged down in clinic work due to patient visits going over the limit and prolonged inbox work. \n\nThe first half will address picking a good job fit for you (there's another guide floating around about how money isn't everything and one about negotiating so I'll try to avoid overlap).\n\nThe second half is how to optimize clinic and inbox workflow to enjoy a lunch and getting out on time every day. Feel free to skip to whichever part you're interested in. As always my intent is only to help and never to offend. I am always open to feedback and people adding their own pearls of wisdom in the comments (invariably I always wish after seeing great comments I could edit my original post).\n\nVery briefly, I'm years over a decade in the game now having done many specialties and roles as a PA. I've been lucky to have a job that checks many boxes but I've also had jobs that made me want to pull my hair out. I also will say upfront that being able to move geographically (and I totally understand not everyone can) opens up substantial possibilities. The underserved healthcare areas (both rural and urban) often are a sweet spot for us PAs in terms of good pay, high autonomy, and reasonable cost of living. But there's many other factors to finding where you belong as a PA. So without further adue...\n\n___________________________\n\nI. Finding the right job fit \n\nQ: What specialty or job should I go into?\n\nPAs are a bit different than doctors in that the job itself has more to do with job satisfaction than the specialty. For example, some dermatology positions (a great lifestyle gig for docs, by which I mean good pay and good schedule with minimal call or dumpster fire emergencies) have poor pay and schedules for PAs. Alternatively some gunner positions such as neurosurgery (meaning jobs with high acuity, complex patients, but rough hours) can have a very accommodating schedule for PAs where the doctors deal with most the call and super stressful situations. \n\nThat said, fields that generally lead to high burnout are marked by two things: too many problems in a short time span, and too many high risk responsibilities without enough support. I had a job like this for years and loved it but after having kids it quickly became not for me. The classic fields this describes are CT surgery, neurosurgery, trauma and critical care, emergency medicine, NICU. I'm sure I'm forgetting some but those are typical examples. \n\nFamily, internal, hospitalist, and pediatric medicine while not always high acuity have high complexity and often pressure you to see one hundred problems an hour (sadly not pure hyperbole as four patients can easily have twenty five problems each in today's world) and belong on this list of high burnout jobs despite not being high acuity. \n\nThese jobs are great... For people who are impassioned by this line of work. An analogy: very social people would love to go out three nights a week for years on end. Others of us would just as soon stand in a corner before doing so. The important thing is matching the quality of work with what fufills you and doesn't leave you exhausted in your off time. \n\nThe more lifestyle specialties include dermatology, sleep medicine, wound care, low acuity plastics, low acuity ENT, pure clinic urology, radiation oncology, of course many others. \n\nIn the middle are various medical and surgical subspecialties. As you will fulfill a specialist role you get to focus on a few problems at a time (usually) and avoid a fair amount of scut work. This includes most surgical subspecialties that are mixed inpatient/outpatient/OR (Ortho, surgical and I'll add also medical oncology, head neck oncology, not purely outpatient urology [which is what I do], cardiology and EP (though this can be high acuity if mostly inpatient), burn medicine. Obviously many others here as well. \n\nFinally there are very niche fields including those that are purely OR based, purely procedure based (IR), and then the options for people who don't want to practice clinical medicine (occupational medicine to a degree, veteran exams, admin, education, or men's clinic or medical spa to a degree). \n\nAnd then there's of course urgent care. If you know, you know (jk my UC PAs, much love!)\n\nMy advice is think more about your lifestyle (enjoying yourself at work, good hours, enough time off, enough time with patients) twice as much as what specialty interests you. Granted some things just aren't gonna fit (I could never do OB GYN for example) but in general, better to be happy in a less \"interesting\" specialty than miserable in one that sounds really cool. I also would say really worry less about specialty than you do about getting the right fit. Which brings me to...\n\n___________________________\n\nQ: How do I find the right fit?\n\nYou need to get your priorities straight. You can have it all sometimes but often not. Decide what matters most out of:\n\n- salary (10K more a year to be miserable ain't worth it. But 40K more a year to deal with 25% more stress is quite reasonable for most of us)\n- schedule (hours that match your spouse or kids, versus shift work [three twelves or seven on seven off], days or nights)\n- how much time off, especially for those who love to travel\n- good education and positive vibes from colleagues, good support staff in clinic or OR\n- how much you wanna be challenged (you want the disaster patients often or more solveable problems?)\n- room for growth\n\nWhen you interview you need to be as honest as possible about what you want. In surgery how, much dedicated first assist time? If you love OR and hear \"let's get you set up in clinic first we'll figure that out later\" think twice. If you had a bad first job and need training and hear \"oh you'll shadow for a month then don't worry the doc is only a text away\", don't be fooled twice. \n\nGreen flags (not a slam dunk but a good sign): other PAs there happy, high staff retention, half days or admin time, doc who wants you to become autonomous (\"if you're interested you can also learn XYZ!\")\n\nRed flags (not a hard no but proceed with caution): never had a PA or they don't last long, high general staff turn over, call or significant extra hours without clear extra pay, working at multiple sites, people seem unhappy (trust your gut!)\n\n___________________________\n\nQ: But I really need a job / I already took a job I'm unhappy at\n\nGreat advice: the best time to job hunt is while currently employed. Grass isn't always greener but life is like a bicycle. If you just sit there, you fall on your ass. If you start pedelling (interview elsewhere even if don't accept it), you learn to ride and can easily begin to navigate the road and get to your destination. \n\nIf there's nothing better and you can't move, pause and try again in a couple months. \n\n___________________________\n\nQ: I'm unhappy in primary care, did I make a mistake being a PA?\n\nMy background originally was EM and IM. These PAs are true front line heroes and deserve the upmost respect (along with general surgery PAs, the front line of the surgical world). However the work is hard and underappreciated and not for everyone. Learning and seeing everything isn't fun forever for all of us. \n\nSwitching to subspecialty surgery for me was a game changer. No more ten problems, how about two or three or even one per patient. Inpatient I can do my thing and be done, no dispo problems. I still moonlight IM and have mad respect for it but always love going back to my real job where I don't have to think nonstop about everything. Generally the same applies for medical subspecialties (cardio, oncology, endocrinology, maybe not GI sorry y'all have it as rough as the PCPs!)\n\n___________________________\n\nQ: I'm unhappy and in a damn subspecialty, what about me?!\n\nYep, grass ain't always greener. IM you get a lot more autonomy especially compared to surgery or sub-subspecialty roles. Your patients often bring you Christmas gifts to clinic. So there's no one size fits all. The point is if you're unhappy don't ask \"did I choose the wrong field?\" Before first seriously ask \"am I in the right role for me?\"\n\nAgain, for PAs, job description often trumps specialty. I know urology PAs working fifty hours a week and IM PAs doing 32 hour work weeks. \n\nOkay so moving on. \n\n___________________________\n\nII. How to get home on time and enjoy lunch everyday. \n\nThis is getting long so I'm gonna focus purely on clinic for this post and in honor of the House of God, make this a ten commandments type situation. \n\nNow some may find this list harsh. I did too for a while. But wanna know what was harsher? My family seeing me get home late, tired, and grumpy consistently. So I decided to be \"harsh\" at work and let my family get the happy, please others version of me, not the other way around. \n\n1. Thou shall not do inbox work for free \n- if I can't tell my MA how to answer it for me, they're coming in to clinic to discuss whatever it is (obviously special circumstances merit exceptions for this and any other rule)\n- if I order a CT or specific lab panel, my patient will call and schedule to review with me in clinic, not discuss over the phone\n- if labs are overdue or last visit was missed, see me before a refill\n\n2. Thou shall demand patients respect thy time\n- if you're late and I can't spare the time, you're going to have to reschedule \n- when your time is up it's up. We can reschedule next available appointment to finish. I'll do my best to guide my patients. I'll block thirty min slots for known difficult patients. Those who want a half hour face to face for fifteen minute slots Will have the visit ended and be unhappy\n\n3. Thou shall do work of a PA\n- I don't expect my MA to diagnose and prescribe. My MA doesn't expect me to step on their toes either\n- scheduling and admin stuff? Sure, with dedicated admin time. Otherwise, thanks but no thanks!\n\n4. Thou shall use technology to work smarter not harder\n- Scribe AI becoming an absolute game changer. Heidi is free and works well. FreedAI is a bit nicer if you wanna spend CME money on it but Heidi alone is enough IMHO for those that want to stick with free. Many others and almost all have a free trial\n- OpenEvidence is free with your NPI and like chat gpt for us\n\n5. Thou shall stay in thy lane\n- PCP PAs use your consultants! We have time to discuss one problem at a time, you don't. I can see a clinic patient for such a problem if Everytime you try he wants to discuss ten other things. Send them over!\n- Consultant PAs stick with what you know best. If you're not comfortable managing something bring in your doc or consult out to sub subspecialty as appropriate\n\n6. Thou shall not be a perfectionist (with care, explanations to patients, notes - self explanatory)\n\n7. Thou shall live and learn. To err is human. Don't beat yourself up, learn and move on. And somon and so forth. \n\n8. Thou shall have fun at work. It's crazy how much drama can stew at the clinic or nurse station. Lighten up! Humor is the best medicine after all. \n\nK guys. I'm really dragging to hit ten tbh. Hope you all enjoyed!",

    "text": "I work in clinic but in a surgical specialty, left the room after seeing a patient, and just heard one of my SP's talking about how someone is like a bad resident and leaves at the end of the workday without asking if anybody needs anything. They got awkward, stared at me in silence for a bit and then continued after I left. \n\nThe same doc shortly after I overheard them talking about the PA's job is to do anything to make sure the SP's needs are all met at the end of the day...\n\nI had a bad experience of my docs making me see patients afterhours without overtime and just making up work for me. So I started to just leave when my work is over.\n\nEvery time I have a question, they bring up \"When I was a resident, I did this. I did that.\" \"When I was a resident... When I was a resident.\" Where I work they think PA's are lifelong scrub residents and should behave like one.\n\nI am underpaid compared to peers, work over hours too. We have no hope of graduating \"residency\" to becoming an MD with 3x the salary we make now! I think this is all fucked up. Doctors treating PA's like residents. What do you guys think?",
