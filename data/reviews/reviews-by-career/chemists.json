It was a busy time of year with my work, but I tried my best to answer all questions on my original post. Just to reiterate: there was no heat source, flame, or refracted light when this happened. \n\nHere's a picture of the scissors, the letter that they sent, and a picture of a little box of post-its and 3M products that they sent me (no scissors included 😂). \n\nSorry that this update is not very exciting. Maybe they'll do a bit about \"The Spontaneously Combusting Scissors\" scissors on Unsolved Mysteries one day (cue theme song music). ",

I know that it is best to keep it refrigerated, But I'm interested in making a mix that is stable at room temperature for at least a couple of months\n\n\n(5g of PEO in 1 liter)\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sgsjs0cWg5tM8lmZYkPeklC_mBKIzNUY/view?usp=drivesdk\n\nMany have recommended me to put xanthan gum on the mix to help the PEO, but I don't know how much this would help \n\nAnother problem that was detected with the Cum Lube, it do not stick on the toys, at least not in the Platinum silicone used by Bad Dragon, it just slides off, I don't know if I can show you that, so I wouldn't\nIt does stick well on the skin, but not in the toy and that can cause trouble using it\n\nI have been told that this can be solved by adding glycerin but I don't know if it is really the solution \n\n\nAnd finally and most important,\n\nI read about cross linked PEO, With different methods you can make the PEO chains join laterally creating a Reticle, From what I could read, it can help give stability to the gel to temperature and pH changes, and increases the thickness of the mixture,\n\nBut of the three methods I read, one requires UV light. And I don't have access to it, The other requires peroxides, and is not safe for intimate use.  And the last one I read is using calcium chloride, As such it does not generate physical bonds, but the ionic attraction generates weak bridges that function as if they were, But I also read that this type of union is the most unstable and eventually degrades as well.\n\n\nThis is the part I am most interested and I need help the most, how I can correctly crosslink the PEO?, and how I can make it stick to the toys?\n\n ",

YouTube: He gets one hour, and he only uses it to watch chemistry channels &amp; Internet/AI Tools: He uses these to look up concepts, formulas, and experimental procedures.\n\nHis current focus is on small, contained experiments. He constantly asks me to go to hardware stores to buy common compounds that contain the specific acids he needs (usually diluted household items).\n\nSo, now...?\n\n\\- Next Steps in Education: How can I best support this passion? \n\n\\- Understanding His Work: My own chemistry knowledge is completely outdated and I do not speak this \"language\" well. I’ve attached pictures of some of the formulas and reactions he is working on, and honestly, they look like hieroglyphs to me! Can anyone shed some light on what these concepts might be?\n\nHe's even started his own small [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/@home-stuff-to-sciene?si=UKi_wipXjL6ukrEr) to document his experiments (with supervision, of course!): \n\nProud Dad of a young chemist!

Those containers will have a good chunk of copper in them and they were sold off to other copper recycling companies that have the means to handle them (basically free waste removal and get paid for the waste as well). So no waste goes into the environment or the sewage \n\nthe place was filled with equipments from the 80s. While many may consider the whole setup looks primitive, over there I learnt more about inorganic chemistry in one year than what I learnt in school for 3 years\n\ndue to the fact that i was not in a corporate environment, i was not supervised and the owner was very hand off so he just handed me the key to the whole lab, so i would just show up and not put on any PPE on and start doing cowboy chemistry. Anyway I rly don't recommend anyone handling strong acids without PPE. thinking back, i thank God for the fact that nothing serious happened.

The only person actively encouraging me to go to grad school is the PI of the lab I am working in. Every grad student I have spoken to has advised me to stay away from a PhD for one reason or another. \n\nI don't want to work in academia. I also am not sure industry will be able to make me happy the way learning about chemistry makes me happy. I really enjoy learning about chemistry. I could absolutely see myself enjoying the PhD on its own, but I'm getting the feeling that a lot of the jobs won't be as fulfilling.\n\nDo those of you who loved chemistry early on still find it fulfilling as a career?",

    "text": "Hi everyone. Im gonna start this with sorry if I sound emotional or frustrated but its been a hard year.\n\nI graduated last year with a First in chemistry. I got a job in R&amp;D secured for when I graduated. It was on a year contract but basically guaranteed to get a permanent job if you did well. Every single other year before me had jobs available for people after doing their first years contract. Everything was going well and I received massive praise for everything I was doing. However, it was funded by public money and they were struggling financially. So no jobs were available. The staff themselves were gutted to be losing me and said that to please apply for anything that comes up in the future because they'd love to have me back. They said any other year I would have been guaranteed the job at the end and it was solely the companies financial situation which caused it. They made a minimum of 10% of the workforce redundant while I was there, so I am skeptical if the financial situation has changed since I left and if I should try and see if any jobs are available.\n\nAnyway I decided contract work wasnt for me and I managed to secure a permanent job, which I started around 6 months ago. Again everything was going great. I received massive praise off staff members and my manager. However, yesterday there was a last minute meeting from the CEO of the company and basically we are going into administration and are shutting the majority of the sites and selling them. They are only keeping the sites in the UK open but only until they find a buyer. If they dont find a buyer then we are going into liquidation. They said they are starting consultations immediately and will be making headcount reductions. Im not stupid and I know this means that I will be made redundant as most of my work was to help support the sites that are being shut down. I obviously wont receive any redundancy money and I dont even know when I will be made redundant. It could be by the end of the week or in a few weeks/months. \n\nSafe to say I got home and I have cried since I finished my shift and have not slept at all. Im just devastated and I have to go into work today and hold it together. I genuinely have loved both jobs but I have lost them through no fault of my own. I thought I was doing the right thing going for a career in STEM. I thought it lead to good job opportunities but in 1 year and a half ive lost two jobs. I just dont know what to do. I feel like I keep side stepping to keep paying the bills rather than staying at one company and really trying to work towards progression and goals. I rewrote my CV last night and started applying to jobs again but I am really worrying that my entire life will be constant job hunting and redundancies. All I want is some stability. Please tell me it gets better. Or please does anyone just have any advice for me? I genuinely just cant stop crying. I feel like a massive failure and really wondering if I have made all the wrong choices with my degree and career.",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\n  \nI'm a first-year undergrad taking chem, and I have absolutely fallen in love with lab work. I always knew I really enjoyed the subject, but I didn't realize how much I'd adore working in the lab -- even just in general chemistry 1.\n\nHere's what worries me, though: because of a disability, I can't really stand. If I do, I get shaky and slowly become more and more lightheaded until I actually pass out, which is... not particularly safe for anyone. In my courses, I have a TA who helps me with walking around to grab reagents and whatnot, but in a real environment, I'd be able to prepare everything I need before starting, which I believe is good practice anyways -- so that doesn't concern me as much. It's just that I need to use a stool to sit down at the lab bench. Mind you, they're also obligated to have a wheelchair-accessible bench, so I can tuck myself into the bench and avoid the chemical-burns-on-thighs problem.\n\nRealistically, would I be able to do that either working in industry or in academia, beyond education? Is this something anyone has seen in place before? Obviously I'd be disappointed if it's not possible, but I just don't want to plan for a career (or really, a life, because when has academia had work-life balance?) that's not feasible. I'd like to know in advance.\n\n  \nThanks for your input :)",

Just wanted to ask - what do you think about the progression of Walt’s career in the show? Is it realistic?\n\nIn particular, what do you think caused his inability to maintain a decent chemistry job?\n\nFor context. Walt finishes his masters at Caltech. He starts a company with his best friend, where he does a lot of amazing research. A few years in, he leaves the company in an ego-related temper tantrum from a breakup with another employee. After that, he gets a job at Sandia National Laboratory for a few years. At some point, he has a child with cerebral palsy. At some point, his old company skyrockets and Walt gets a plaque for research contributing to a Nobel Prize (though not the award itself). Fast forward almost 2 decades, and his career is in shambles, he’s working as a high school teacher. He was born in 1958, and he’s been a high school teacher for a while by 2008, for some context on the timeline.\n\nIt’s still hotly debated in the Breaking Bad community to this day what caused his career to fall apart. A lot of people blame it primarily on his ego and being hard to work with. While I’m inclined to think that was part of the reason, I also figured that not having a PhD would severely limit his career progression, and his need for stability/healthcare resources when his disabled child was born would probably reduce the list of acceptable jobs. Walt is established to be a hardworking genius, and I find it hard to believe that in the somewhat ego-filled world of academia, he was so exceptionally disagreeable that no one would hire him even though he’s a genius and had some significant papers. I don’t work in chemistry though, so I could be totally wrong.\n\nWhat do you guys think?",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm finishing up my PhD in Food Science this summer. For background, I went straight from earning my B.S. in Chemistry into a Master’s in Food Science, then rolled straight into the PhD program, so I’ve had no industry experience until recently.\n\nAbout a year ago, my advisor began prioritizing other students, and I was left running the lab, managing research projects, and mentoring newer students academically. It got to the point where I decided to start applying for jobs. I landed an interview at a major CPG company for an R&amp;D scientist contractor role. Unbeknownst to me, the hiring manager was a close friend of my advisor, and they called my advisor behind the scenes (I hadn't listed them as a reference), which blew my cover. Ironically, that seemed to make my advisor finally start paying attention and push me toward graduating on time.\n\nI’ve now been at this big CPG company for 7 months. I’ve had great performance, bringing in internal testing capabilities projected to save the company millions annually. Despite that, I’m still a contractor, and while I survived recent layoffs, the company isn’t doing well financially.\n\nRecently, they opened up several Associate Scientist roles in my department. Although the title says “Associate,” the job responsibilities are equivalent to Scientist, HR downgraded the title due to FTE limits. Oddly enough, while I'm being offered this downgraded Associate role, technicians in the same department are being promoted to “Associate Scientist” titles but will remain in technician-level roles. For context, this company typically offers PhDs a Scientist or Senior Scientist position. HR admitted I’m overqualified but said I can still get the Associate role, just with a starting salary and no eligibility for promotion for 2–3 years.\n\nSo, I started applying externally. I got an interview and then an offer from another major CPG company nearby. Originally, I interviewed for a **Scientist** role with a $95K salary and 5% bonus. However, HR called and said I’m “severely underqualified” for the Scientist title but they still want to offer me the job as an **Associate Scientist** at $75K. I pushed back, saying I don’t believe I’m underqualified and asked for $80K. They responded that even $80K was too high. I’m confused because this is the same role I was interviewed for with the same responsibilities and originally offered $95K.\n\nI can’t tell if I’m being lowballed, or if this is just how things are right now due to the economy. I know other fresh PhDs who walked into Senior Scientist roles right out of grad school. I have strong analytical experience (GC, HPLC, method development, etc.) and have delivered measurable impact at my current job.\n\nIs anyone else going through something similar? Am I missing something here? Would love to hear other perspectives, especially from folks in food science, chemistry, or related CPG roles.",
