    "title": "A brief history- The OG Cutout",
    "text": "Developed in the early 1900s, the Plug-Type Cutout is considered to be the very first commercially produced primary cutout in the industry. \n\nPrior to its introduction, primary protection for pole transformers was all but non-existent, and outages on entire feeders due to transformer faults were fairly common. This type of cutout was developed and produced when companies such as General Electric and Westinghouse saw the need for transformer protection to alleviate these problems. Typical ratings for these cutouts were 2,500-3,000 volts, with fuse sizes from 30-50 amps maximum. \n\nThese early cutouts relied on expulsion action to interrupt current flow, just as most modern cutouts do, albeit unconfined in a barrel or tube. Internal energized parts were in close proximity to each-other (and the operator), and were prone to arcing when attempting to break load. \n\nInjuries and fatalities sustained among linemen during operation of these cutouts were a frequent occurrence. They would often explode when closed in on a fault, sending porcelain shrapnel in every direction, or arc and burn/melt when pulled open under load. These characteristics, coupled with the fact that these had to be operated by hand, quickly earned them the nickname (suicide boxes) among linemen at the time. \n\nA practice was quickly developed among linemen of tying “monkey tails”, a short piece of rope tied to the plug handle, with a monkey’s fist knot at the other end. This allowed a lineman to grab and pull the plug from a greater distance, helping to lessen the hazard. In later years, special wooden “safety sticks” were developed to operate plug-type cutouts from a greater distance, increasing safety. These “safety sticks” would later lead to the development of the insulated switch stick. \n\nThese cutouts saw widespread use, well into the 1920s, before feigning obsolescence in the 1930s, replaced by porcelain “chocolate boxes” and open-type cutouts, which are the main type used today. \n\nPictures 1-5 are of GE and Westinghouse plug-type cutouts, showing the stab/plug, and the inside contacts. \n\nPicture 6 is of a typical early 1900s transformer installation, showing plug-type cutouts mounted to the top crossarm. \n\nPicture 7 shows some new-old stock fuse links for plug-types. These links are 100 years old!\n\nPictures 8-12 are vintage ads for plug-type cutouts, 1915-1921. \n",

    "title": "LIneman in South Korea",
    "text": "Hello! I'm someone working as a lineman in South Korea. I became curious about how linemen work overseas, so I searched and ended up here.\n\nIn the case of the United States, since the supply voltage is different from Korea, I thought the work might be different as well, so I have a lot of questions. After reading through the posts, I noticed that the most fundamental difference seems to be that. In Korea, outdoor work without using aerial work vehicles is strictly prohibited. We are not allowed to perform work on utility poles with wearing fall protection gear. Two years ago, there were too many falling accidents, so Korea's public utility company, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), enforced this ban.\n\nIt’s probably due to differences in industrial structure and culture. Korea’s power market is regulated by the government and is not privatized. Therefore, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) is responsible for the electricity supply across the entire country. For new installations, demolitions, maintenance, and other projects, they outsource the work to partner companies like the one I work for. So, field workers in outdoor construction cannot decide on the work methods autonomously.\n\nAlso, in Korea, 90% of the work is done as \"live-line\" work, meaning without cutting off the power. Because of this, when working on 22.9kV high-voltage lines, the only possible method is to use insulated sticks to work from a distance. The work of directly touching high-voltage lines with insulated gloves was prohibited three years ago.\n\nI’m not sure about overseas, but in Korea, there is a specific process to become a lineman. You start as a ground-level assistant doing general tasks, then move on to work on utility poles while wearing fall protection gear, and finally, you get trained to operate aerial work vehicles to become a lineman. Due to the ban on working with fall protection gear, it has become really difficult for new workers, or apprentices, to learn the job in Korea.\n\nFortunately, I’m transitioning to a new company where I’ll be responsible for aerial work vehicles starting next year, becoming an 'live-line' worker, even though I had to give up better conditions to join a company with worse ones. Currently, in Korea, if you want to become a lineman, you have to give up living like a normal person for the first few years, hahaha\n\nIn Korea, a ground-level assistant worker earns $223 for a 10-hour day(not 8hrs lol). Linemen without their own aerial work vehicles earn $373 a day, while linemen with their own aerial work vehicles earn $746. These amounts are based on the current broken exchange rate in South Korea.\n\nAlso, the salaries above are for a small number of freelancers who are members of labor unions. The majority of workers are full-time employees at subcontractor companies of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), with entry-level workers earning $1,700/month, mid-level workers earning $2,700, and senior linemen earning around $7,800. ...I want to go abroad....\n\nIf you have any questions, free to ask. My English isn't that great, so there might be some mistranslations here and there! If my English level improves, I would love to work in a country like yours, but realistically, it might be impossible, right? lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr15ympnnk9e1.jpg?width=2992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a353b87aea7e199dee35cdf7e5d142ae578004a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p834vppnnk9e1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c32c69d4ab0190dda81028f3bd444ac343c589a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jz6pappnnk9e1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69cca81a786755d40024abca5c37d198f364d844\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c21dfqpnnk9e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=785922577ede0d1706758ef0240a23aae506badf\n\n",

    "title": "IBEW Journeyman Lineman / apprentice trauma",
    "text": "I went through and completed an IBEW Journeyman Lineman apprenticeship. While I somehow found a way to complete it and earn the classification of Journeyman Lineman; I cannot do the job. I found the apprenticeship to be so traumatizing, when I take a call I cannot get past feeling stressed, inadequate and full of anxiety, because I was demoralized and treated like shit for 3+years every day on the job, I lack confidence in my skills and ability and feel like I do not fit in. I forced myself to finish the program, thinking it would be and feel different when I topped out. No more getting treated like shit, feeling like shit, being constantly criticized and scrutinized in every and any way.\n\nI think the work environment and culture is completely toxic in every way. Aside from being treated like shit for years, I was shocked and still am by the way these grown men treat other grown men, no human should treat another the way they do and the way it is just accepted in the trade. Racism is rampant and widely accepted, which I find to be disgusting and unacceptable in any form. Locker room talk about women. Nepotism across the board. If you are part of the good ole' boys club you can get away with anything, if you're not, you are pushed out. I bet you can guess by now  I'm not a part of that club and never will be. I've not been able to keep a job more than 2-3 months since completing the apprenticeship a little over 2 years ago. All the guys will be decent to your face and talk shit to everyone behind your back like immature teenagers.  I've accepted it is not for me. I know  I'm not the only person that feels like this.\n\nAnother very fucking challenging part of my apprenticeship was the travel. I didn't work one day at home, I traveled for the whole thing.  My home local is a sticking local and all I did my whole apprenticeship was travel and glove. Topped out and was worthless as a JL at home which also fed and feeds into the lack of confidence piece. I asked the director of my program more than once to work local and get stick time and it fell on def ears. I've since traveled some and done some sticking, not a ton but I kinda get it.\n\nI'm most likely getting out of the trade, there is no amount of money worth my mental health. There are millions of people out there making a much better living than JL's working much less. We are glorified hole diggers. Too much machismo and ego. How you make your money is more important than how much you make. I've been unemployed more than employed since I topped out a little over 2 years ago. I get so much anxiety about the idea of being on the right of way I can't bring myself to sign the books. I've racked up more cc debt than I ever thought I would have. I'm not going to spend 2 days around people I don't care for, let alone 20 years just because \"it's a great job\". For some it is. For many it isn't, which explains high rates of divorce and all the alcohol and drug abuse. Just my 2 cents.",

    "title": "How to become a Journeyman Lineman",
    "text": "#How To Become a Journeyman Lineman\n\n\n&gt;MILITARY.  If you are currently serving in the military or recently separated (VEEP up to 5 years) there are several programs specifically for you to help you transition into skilled trades.  This will give you the most direct and sure opportunity to become a Lineman.  Please check out the [Military Resources Wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lineman/wiki/index/military_resources/) to learn about these great programs and see if you qualify.\n\n#Journeymen Linemen\n\n\nJourneymen Linemen are High voltage workers who are responsible for the installation, maintenance and repair of electric infrastructure.  It can range from working on large transmission towers to being in a crowded vault.  Linemen work in all weather conditions and at all hours.  Heat, cold, wind, rain, snow and everything else.  It involves time away from home, missed holidays and birthdays etc.\n\nThe steps to becoming a Journeyman Lineman generally involve working your way up from the bottom.    \n\nFirst you work as a Laborer or a Groundman (Linehelper, Apprentice Trainee, Etc).  These are entry level positions.  These positions involve menial tasks that introduce you to the trade.  You'll be stocking the trucks, getting tools, running the handline, cleaning off trucks and getting trucks ready to go at the start of shift. Here you will become familiar with methods, tools and materials used in the trade.  Sometimes you can get into the trade as a first step apprentice.\n\nNext you have to become an apprentice.  Apprenticeships are around 3.5 years.  Being  an apprentice involves the obvious.  You will now begin formal training to reach Lineman status.  You will learn to do the work of a Lineman in incremental steps until you top out.\n\n# Apprenticeships\n\n***IBEW Union apprenticeships:*** you must interview and get indentured in your local jurisdiction.  This is the most recognized apprenticeship.  You will be able to get work anywhere with a union ticket.  Union utility companies may offer in house NJATC apprenticeships as well.  \n\n***DOL (Department of Labor) apprenticeships:***  This is a typically non-union apprenticeship sanctioned by the DOL.  It is around 5 steps then you are a B-Lineman, then you become an A-Lineman.  This is not recognized by the IBEW, but you can test in to an IBEW Lineman.\n\n***Company apprenticeships:***  These are generally non IBEW and non DOL and are the lowest rung and only recognized by your company.  If you leave or the company goes out of business, you don't have a ticket sanctioned by the IBEW or DOL.\n\n***Take Note:*** Please be aware there are different types of Lineman apprenticeships. There are apprenticeships that are \"Transmission\" only, or \"URD\" (Underground) only.  These are not interchangeable with the Journeyman Lineman certification.\n\n# Where do you start?\n\n  Bare minimum age is 18 years old.  The follow job credentials will make your job hunt more successful. In order of importance.\n\n  1. Unrestricted CDL (Commercial Drivers License) Usually required for outside construction.  Some utilities may have a grace period before you need to have it.\n\n  2. First Aid/CPR\n\n  3. Flagger Training\n\n  4. OSHA 10 Construction(if you are new to working on jobsites)\n\n  5. OSHA 10 ET&amp;D (Electrical Transmission and Distribution)\n\n# Line School\n\n&gt;Line school can give you experience you otherwise wouldn't have, which in some cases could be beneficial.  ***Line school may offer you all the previous credentials listed as well***.  Some job postings will require 1-3 yrs related experience or completion of line school.  \n\nSome places like California it's probably a good idea to have it.  \n\nHowever not everyone requires it.\nLineschools are generally an expensive undertaking.  Many take out loans to pay for them.  Not everyone believes they are of value.  It is suggested to try to get in as a groundman first or look to community colleges or other trade schools that are more affordable.  It is highly recommended to do research before you commit to going into debt.  Not everyone makes it in the trade.  Having a large debt is not something to be taken lightly\n\n\n\n\n# Finding work, understanding the trade.\n\nThere's working directly for a utility(working for the residents the utility serves) which one stays within that utility's service area.\n\nIf you're looking to work for a certain employer, check their website for desired qualifications.\n\nThen there's working for outside construction.  This is who does the heavy lifting.  Outside has to potential to earn more than being at a utility.  For many jobs you'll work 5+ days a week and 10-12 hour days.  This also is a traveling job.  You go where the work is.  Especially as an apprentice.  \n\nUnion vs Non-union.  Besides the obvious, this can be affected by location.  The west coast is 100% union.  Places like Louisiana and Kentucky are strongly non-union.  Some utilities are union and some are not.  Same with outside construction.  Utilities and non-union construction hire directly.   For Union jobs in outside construction you must get dispatched from the “out of work” books(books).  Utility companies are union or non-union.\n\nUnion “books.”  Each area has a union hall that has jurisdiction over  that area for construction and has a set of \"out of work\" books for each class.  Lineman, apprentice, groundman and so on.  When a contractor has a position to fill, they call the hall to send someone.  The hall will begin calling the first person on “Book 1” then go down the list until they fill all the calls for workers they have.  Book 1 will be local members with 1500-2000 hrs.  Book 2 will be travelers and locals with less hours.  Book 3 will be doesn't meet hours etc.\n\nCreated 8/23/25\nDM u/ca2alaska for corrections and suggestions\n\n* [Link to Resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Lineman/wiki/resources/)",

By not having the “journeyman lineman” on the ticket, you can’t transition to outside construction work, and are thus sort of “stuck” at that utility - is the point they were making.\n\nIs this true? And if so, what can be done about it?",

    "title": "Switching from Truck Driver to Lineman",
    "text": "Mid 20s. Currently driving trucks. I currently make around $46/hr (CPM) doing no-touch drop and hooks. I only work 7 hours days with no option to work more. I feel I have reached the pinnacle of my current line of work and am looking to increase my salary. Most trucking jobs pay much less and require extremely long hours to make low six-figures.\n\nI have worked in Foodservice with Sysco and am no stranger to long hours. I used to do 14 hour days, so what I currently do feels part-time. I have heard that becoming a Lineman is a lucrative -- but hard career. I have no problem with hard physical work, and know how important safety is.\n\n&gt; Is it worth it for me to become a Lineman?\n\nMy current financial goals need me to make around 120k as a minimum. I don't care if I have to work extremely long hours (80+) to get it. I'd see it as an investment towards my future. And if I work long hours, I would prefer to use it gaining valuable experience in this trade, whereas I feel with truck driving it remains a dead-end job with little job security.\n\nI'd appreciate your thoughts on this matter, thank you.",

Seems really dangerous and badass so I'd assume it's significantly higher than normal lineman but I don't know, and googling salaries is notoriously inaccurate.\n\nI'm pretty sure you only need to be a journeyman but I was figuring it'd be more like master electrician pay if not higher. \n\nAlso side question, what does the helicopter itself cost to run?

I have quite a bit of underground experience with conduit to the point where I can get sent to my own jobs and complete them. I have a few very good connections with one of the major power companies in my area. At my current company I do not have any benefits I know that if I switch over my family and I will be taken care of. Is it too late for me to make the switch in careers? I mainly want to become a lineman for the betterment of myself and my family. Thanks for any advice. ",
