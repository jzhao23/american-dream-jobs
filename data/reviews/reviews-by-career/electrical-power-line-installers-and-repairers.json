    "title": "A brief history- The OG Cutout",
    "text": "Developed in the early 1900s, the Plug-Type Cutout is considered to be the very first commercially produced primary cutout in the industry. \n\nPrior to its introduction, primary protection for pole transformers was all but non-existent, and outages on entire feeders due to transformer faults were fairly common. This type of cutout was developed and produced when companies such as General Electric and Westinghouse saw the need for transformer protection to alleviate these problems. Typical ratings for these cutouts were 2,500-3,000 volts, with fuse sizes from 30-50 amps maximum. \n\nThese early cutouts relied on expulsion action to interrupt current flow, just as most modern cutouts do, albeit unconfined in a barrel or tube. Internal energized parts were in close proximity to each-other (and the operator), and were prone to arcing when attempting to break load. \n\nInjuries and fatalities sustained among linemen during operation of these cutouts were a frequent occurrence. They would often explode when closed in on a fault, sending porcelain shrapnel in every direction, or arc and burn/melt when pulled open under load. These characteristics, coupled with the fact that these had to be operated by hand, quickly earned them the nickname (suicide boxes) among linemen at the time. \n\nA practice was quickly developed among linemen of tying “monkey tails”, a short piece of rope tied to the plug handle, with a monkey’s fist knot at the other end. This allowed a lineman to grab and pull the plug from a greater distance, helping to lessen the hazard. In later years, special wooden “safety sticks” were developed to operate plug-type cutouts from a greater distance, increasing safety. These “safety sticks” would later lead to the development of the insulated switch stick. \n\nThese cutouts saw widespread use, well into the 1920s, before feigning obsolescence in the 1930s, replaced by porcelain “chocolate boxes” and open-type cutouts, which are the main type used today. \n\nPictures 1-5 are of GE and Westinghouse plug-type cutouts, showing the stab/plug, and the inside contacts. \n\nPicture 6 is of a typical early 1900s transformer installation, showing plug-type cutouts mounted to the top crossarm. \n\nPicture 7 shows some new-old stock fuse links for plug-types. These links are 100 years old!\n\nPictures 8-12 are vintage ads for plug-type cutouts, 1915-1921. \n",

    "title": "LIneman in South Korea",
    "text": "Hello! I'm someone working as a lineman in South Korea. I became curious about how linemen work overseas, so I searched and ended up here.\n\nIn the case of the United States, since the supply voltage is different from Korea, I thought the work might be different as well, so I have a lot of questions. After reading through the posts, I noticed that the most fundamental difference seems to be that. In Korea, outdoor work without using aerial work vehicles is strictly prohibited. We are not allowed to perform work on utility poles with wearing fall protection gear. Two years ago, there were too many falling accidents, so Korea's public utility company, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), enforced this ban.\n\nIt’s probably due to differences in industrial structure and culture. Korea’s power market is regulated by the government and is not privatized. Therefore, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) is responsible for the electricity supply across the entire country. For new installations, demolitions, maintenance, and other projects, they outsource the work to partner companies like the one I work for. So, field workers in outdoor construction cannot decide on the work methods autonomously.\n\nAlso, in Korea, 90% of the work is done as \"live-line\" work, meaning without cutting off the power. Because of this, when working on 22.9kV high-voltage lines, the only possible method is to use insulated sticks to work from a distance. The work of directly touching high-voltage lines with insulated gloves was prohibited three years ago.\n\nI’m not sure about overseas, but in Korea, there is a specific process to become a lineman. You start as a ground-level assistant doing general tasks, then move on to work on utility poles while wearing fall protection gear, and finally, you get trained to operate aerial work vehicles to become a lineman. Due to the ban on working with fall protection gear, it has become really difficult for new workers, or apprentices, to learn the job in Korea.\n\nFortunately, I’m transitioning to a new company where I’ll be responsible for aerial work vehicles starting next year, becoming an 'live-line' worker, even though I had to give up better conditions to join a company with worse ones. Currently, in Korea, if you want to become a lineman, you have to give up living like a normal person for the first few years, hahaha\n\nIn Korea, a ground-level assistant worker earns $223 for a 10-hour day(not 8hrs lol). Linemen without their own aerial work vehicles earn $373 a day, while linemen with their own aerial work vehicles earn $746. These amounts are based on the current broken exchange rate in South Korea.\n\nAlso, the salaries above are for a small number of freelancers who are members of labor unions. The majority of workers are full-time employees at subcontractor companies of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), with entry-level workers earning $1,700/month, mid-level workers earning $2,700, and senior linemen earning around $7,800. ...I want to go abroad....\n\nIf you have any questions, free to ask. My English isn't that great, so there might be some mistranslations here and there! If my English level improves, I would love to work in a country like yours, but realistically, it might be impossible, right? lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr15ympnnk9e1.jpg?width=2992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a353b87aea7e199dee35cdf7e5d142ae578004a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p834vppnnk9e1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c32c69d4ab0190dda81028f3bd444ac343c589a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jz6pappnnk9e1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69cca81a786755d40024abca5c37d198f364d844\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c21dfqpnnk9e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=785922577ede0d1706758ef0240a23aae506badf\n\n",

    "title": "IBEW Journeyman Lineman / apprentice trauma",
    "text": "I went through and completed an IBEW Journeyman Lineman apprenticeship. While I somehow found a way to complete it and earn the classification of Journeyman Lineman; I cannot do the job. I found the apprenticeship to be so traumatizing, when I take a call I cannot get past feeling stressed, inadequate and full of anxiety, because I was demoralized and treated like shit for 3+years every day on the job, I lack confidence in my skills and ability and feel like I do not fit in. I forced myself to finish the program, thinking it would be and feel different when I topped out. No more getting treated like shit, feeling like shit, being constantly criticized and scrutinized in every and any way.\n\nI think the work environment and culture is completely toxic in every way. Aside from being treated like shit for years, I was shocked and still am by the way these grown men treat other grown men, no human should treat another the way they do and the way it is just accepted in the trade. Racism is rampant and widely accepted, which I find to be disgusting and unacceptable in any form. Locker room talk about women. Nepotism across the board. If you are part of the good ole' boys club you can get away with anything, if you're not, you are pushed out. I bet you can guess by now  I'm not a part of that club and never will be. I've not been able to keep a job more than 2-3 months since completing the apprenticeship a little over 2 years ago. All the guys will be decent to your face and talk shit to everyone behind your back like immature teenagers.  I've accepted it is not for me. I know  I'm not the only person that feels like this.\n\nAnother very fucking challenging part of my apprenticeship was the travel. I didn't work one day at home, I traveled for the whole thing.  My home local is a sticking local and all I did my whole apprenticeship was travel and glove. Topped out and was worthless as a JL at home which also fed and feeds into the lack of confidence piece. I asked the director of my program more than once to work local and get stick time and it fell on def ears. I've since traveled some and done some sticking, not a ton but I kinda get it.\n\nI'm most likely getting out of the trade, there is no amount of money worth my mental health. There are millions of people out there making a much better living than JL's working much less. We are glorified hole diggers. Too much machismo and ego. How you make your money is more important than how much you make. I've been unemployed more than employed since I topped out a little over 2 years ago. I get so much anxiety about the idea of being on the right of way I can't bring myself to sign the books. I've racked up more cc debt than I ever thought I would have. I'm not going to spend 2 days around people I don't care for, let alone 20 years just because \"it's a great job\". For some it is. For many it isn't, which explains high rates of divorce and all the alcohol and drug abuse. Just my 2 cents.",

    "text": "So here’s the thing I’ve been in the army for 10 years( Army infantry currently a drill sergeant ) . I’m looking for a change and I’m very much considering getting out and getting into the lineman field. Does anyone have any experience recently getting out of the army and into line work? One of my biggest concerns is getting out and not having a steady source of income for me and my family. I’m thinking that being in a union would be comfortable for me because of the structured environment. I’m considering looking into the veep program. Any suggestions ? Experiences ? Tips ? \n\nAnother question I have is apprenticeship salaries in Florida and North Carolina. How much can I anticipate getting paid in my first year? ",
