    "text": "Photoelasticity (often called photostress) was the go-to way to “see” stress in transparent parts from about the 1940s to the 1980s. Engineers coated or made models from special plastics, then viewed them under polarized light—stress showed up as colorful fringe patterns, making high-stress areas easy to spot.\n\nBefore that, stress was measured with mechanical strain gauges or calculated by hand. Today, it’s mostly replaced by digital strain gauges and finite element analysis (FEA), which give faster, more precise results without physical models.\n\n",

    "title": "My grandpa was a coke oven engineer, and I've transcribed his final invention from hospice",
    "text": "20 years ago, in the last few months of his life, my grandpa became consumed with this idea of a plasma-heated coke oven. He was a coke oven engineer for decades and had several patents. \n\nBut as a non-engineer, I'm curious what /r/engineering has to say about this. Is it interesting and coherent? Have these ideas been adopted? Are they no longer relevant? Would it do the world good? \n\nRegardless, I'm sure he would want to see it shared! Here's a carefully made transcript from about 30 minutes of recording.\n\n\"Well, anyhow, the thing about how you're gonna to zap this: if we use the Westinghouse units, which are small, I figured that each unit would do about 4 cubic feet of coal. I think when you zap it, they have some kind of a bayonet or something goes down with this gas. And I figure you'd have one of those for each cubic foot. Now I'm guessing at that, but I think that's within the reasonable range of what you could do.\n\nSo if you have 24 feet of coal slug moving down this system, and you move it two-foot-a-clip—every time you move it you move it two feet, you're actually moving 48 cubic feet, down this slot oven. \n\nYou have to get into the construction, a little bit, of this thing, because to build a refractory slot vertically, to put a lid on it is not much of a problem. You put a little arch over, you got 18 inches to span. Now you lay it down, you've got 24 feet to span, this way. And depending on how far you go, hundreds of feet that way to span. So you have to use a construction called a flat arch. The flat arch is a refractory arch that is supported on the exterior with metal. There's two designs that I'm familiar with: one's the American Arch, that uses round pipe as a supporting structure, and the other one is the Dietrich Arch, which uses cast iron casting support. Either one of them would work; the American would probably be easier to design.\n\nIn order to support that, the top of this oven would to have a support system, so that the first four feet or so is up where you're doin' the charging and have the pistons and all. Of course, that would all be structural steel, and you wouldn't have to support anything.\n\nAnd then when it gets to about six feet, then the refractory would start. When the refractory starts, then you have to support it.\n\nSo, I figured the way this would be designed is, going down you'd have six feet of the initial structure, then you could have two feet of trusswork strength that went across—would be two foot wide and 24 feet or more that way, and it would completely span the unit. Then you'd have a space of six feet, you'd have another structure like that, two foot wide, and so forth. All the way down the line, every six feet you'd have this structure. To visualize it, it'd be like a little bridge across it, except it would be designed in such a way that could hold it.\n\nAnd then the whole area in the middle would have structural beams, or so forth, running from that two foot wide girder type unit over to the next one. And they would be just a few inches above the top of the refractory roof, so that the brick layer, when you put that refractory in, would hang it up and then you would be right there standing on it. And then you have removable grill work on the walkway.\n\nNow the first area you had of that, the first six foot wide area, you'd take the first two foot in the corner, and you'd equip that with a refractory sliding block that slid across the top, and have it powered with air cylinders so that it could be automatically backed off. And that would expose the coal cake, two foot of it—12 inches this way, 24 inches that way—right at that point. Then over on the other side of the six foot draw, it would go up a foot. So, in the first section you'd have two holes, two foot by one foot in the top of the refractory, which you could live with. And they would have removable doors and you would mount these bayonets or whatever they call them, the plasma units, right above them. And the unit for the plasma thing would be just up the, that same six foot area, a short distance, and could be hung on the structural steel, or however you wanted to support it.\n\nIt wouldn't take much room; it looked like the size of a refrigerator.\n\nNow you do that at one end of the 24 inch thing, and over at the other end you do the same thing. Now,  that meant in the first six feet you would have eight square feet exposed.\n\nSo, now you'd have the next two up the line, and the next two up this line. So that in a matter of about six of these units, you would eventually get where you had the whole business covered. So as this coal would be bein' pushed down, this part here would up the temperature, and, of course, as it moved, the next zap would hit the piece behind it. So there would be a piece there, and then a piece up here would be goin'.\n\nAnd on this end of the 24 feet, you would have what they call a 'collecting main,' which is common practice in the slot-baked ovens now. At the end, they have a main that goes along, and they have what they call goose neck connections. They come up out of the refractory—they're lined with masonry—and they go into this collector main. And the collector main is under suction, and it's full of water—sprays, or liquor sprays as they turn out to be. And that's what cools the gases as they're generated. And it's drawing the gas out of this unit.\n\nAnd, of course, these first two at this end, when you're doin it, there's nothing hot coming over the top of it—that's nothing but raw coal above them. And over here the same way. And that's true right up to the middle one. Now, you have a collecting main on both ends, so you're pulling, really, suction on 12 feet of em. 'Cause you have it not really blocked in the middle, but you have it so there's not much clearance.\n\nAnd, so anyhow,  when you finally get down here about 40 feet, you've got it all red hot, and it's gone. And then, every so often from then on, you have resistant bars—like they have in a toaster—that would be fed with electricity. It would be red hot. It would be in the base of the slot. So that any temperature that was lost through the evolution of gas, or radiation, or conduction, or for whatever reason, would be regenerated by these... I don't know what you would call them... resisting units, that would be tied into  your high voltage units over here. And they'd also act as dampeners, because when you kept switching these things off over here, you don't want to slam a million volts and stop it right now; you would instead use a dump switch where it wouldn't be stopped, it would just be diverted into these dampening things. And then through it was used next to heat the coal.\n\nNow, we've got that all, and I, we figure that that would be countin' the first six feet and the rest of you would have 36... you'd have somethin' like 42 feet, maybe. Tthat area would be what we'd call a Preheating Area. All you were doing was heating the coal charge to get it up to around 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit, that's all we need—maybe a little bit more, a little bit less. We don't have to fuse it when you get it up there. So the whole unit wouldn't have to be as strong as most units of this type would be.\n\nSo, now that only takes 42 feet. But we still have all this structure goin' down here—we have 120 more feet. And the reason we have that is, we found from carbonizin' the coal it takes usually in a typical slot-type oven, they call it 'an inch an hour'—so, if you have an oven 18 inches wide, it takes 18 hours to cook it. But, of course, that's based on the fact of startin' from ambient temperature and heating it up—when you dump the coal in, you dump it in by the ambient temperature.\n\nWell, with this setup, you zap it and you're at a workin' temperature of 2000° right away. So I don't think you'll need an inch an hour—in fact, I know from experience you'd probably get by with half that much. So we have only a a 12 inch thick slab and if we decide we could heat it in six hours, then since we're movin' this unit down two foot every six minutes, in an hour we move at 20 feet. And so to get a dwell time of six hours, you need 120 ft.\n\nSo, after this charging area, 42 feet, you'd have 120 more feet of this flat arch business, some strip heaters buried in the floor... and by the time it got through there it, should be completely devolatilized and completely carbonized.\n\nBut now, it's a red hot mass—the same as it would be in a slot-type oven. On a slot-type oven, they open the door and take this pushing machine and push out all this flaming red hot coal—coke—into a car that catches it, a railroad car. And then, after they catch it—we're talkin' on a typical oven about 50 feet of that and 20 some feet high, 18 inches wide—then they run that up under a Quenching Tower, and then they dump tons of water on it. And that's what you see in these Coke Plants, where you see these tremendous clouds. And if you you're down in Indianapolis some days, you look to the southeast and every so often you see this tremendous cloud go up, that's a Quench Cloud. All that heat is wasted. So with this system, you're in a position to much easier recover the heat and cool it down scientifically without quenching it.\n\nSo, you would turn that over to a boiler company and they would have the next 40 feet where this stuff would be going through there at 20 foot an hour. And they would extract the heat from it and make steam. Then when it come out of the end of that, it would be hot, but you would be able to handle it on rubber conveyor belts and whatnot. It would come out, get on conveyor belts and go to storage, and be screened and sorted later.\n\nAnd it would be built sort of like a boiler, and this red hot coke would be running over these tubes that would be full of—you wouldn't use water in them, you'd use Dowtherm, which is a salt solution that can get awfully hot without vaporizing.\n\nAnd so the first two cooling areas that this coke would get in would have tubes of Dowtherm—or similar, there's other chemical—and then they would cool it down. And then the next area would have tubes with water in 'em. Now, then they'd have a Dowtherm boiler, and the Dowtherm converts water to steam. And this whole unit end result would be would makin' steam that would go someplace and make electricity, hopefully. And then your coke would be cool enough to handle, which is all you were after. \n\nNow, the other big source of energy that you're getting is all this gas! That would be handled just as it is now in the modern byproduct gas plant off of coke ovens. So they strip all the goodies out of the gas and then instead of burning it in the unit, they would burn it to make electricity. Because you used electricity up in the initial step and now you're getting sources of electricity. It would power itself.\n\n And the byproducts would be the same as they are in a modern coke oven—you still make all the tar and chemicals and things that they do now! That's where the tar for your roof comes, most of it's coal tar. And your highways: what isn't asphalt is coal tar! And they use the coal tar to mix with the asphalt. Makes the asphalt easier to handle, I guess. And that's a problem today, because these companies don't have a source for their tar! They have to go to China or something, because the coke industry has dropped considerably from when it was at its height right after the World War, after I come back from the Army. But then it started goin' downhill. It's still a big industry in this country, despite all the beating it's taken. But everybody else are in the business now—their governments are more friendly about pollution than our government is.\n\nI didn't mention the plasma stream is a gas stream, and in order to make it, the easiest way, you use natural gas—which has been used before for the plasma ionized stream, is what they call it. And they use the natural gas. Now in this case, the beauty of it is that, since the ionized beam hits the coal within the chamber, within the oven itself, the gas that comes in with the plasma ray goes into the effluent product of the coal and ends up in the byproduct plant. And it's cleaned up and then it's part of the coke oven gas! So it's all recovered. Where in most cases, like where they use this plasma heating for heating steel and stuff, that's all wasted—it goes into the air. But in this case, it's recovered.\n\nAnd now, that just one of these units. And say, well, and of course we got no labor involved! All we have is couple fellas sitting up with a pulpit running and looking at a bunch of instruments and timers and things like that are taking care of—the automation as this thing goes through. Because once it's set it, nobody has to do anything, it just goes.\n\nAnd but now that would, you got 24, say, roughly for figuring sake. You had 24 cubic feet of coal and you move two feet of it every six minutes: in an hour, you'd move 480 cubic feet out of this one oven. And at a conservative rate, the coke would weigh 30lbs.\n\nThe other thing that's very important about this is the materials of construction! The refractory has to be fused silica, which is an expensive refractory, but it has some properties that are essential—for one thing, it is a insulating refractory rather than a conducting refractory and where in a standard coke oven you want to conduct the heat from the gas to the coal, in this process you want to retain the heat in the oven and not lose it through the wall. And fused silica is a very good insulator. It also is very hard and would be resistant to the mechanical abrasion that would come with this type of a utilization. It would also have good structural strength. They also make it in castable, so that the ceiling or flat arch type construction in the oven could be castable fused silica.\n\nRegular silica refractory, like we'd use in a modern coke oven, has very high expansion coefficient. So it expands very high durin' heat and if you cool it down, it cools down in such a way that it's almost impossible to heat it up and cool it down without fracturing the refractory. So in the case of fused silica, the coefficient of expansion is practically nil. So you don't have the problems of expanding refractories, and you can cool the unit down or heat it up! And one of the things I hadn't mentioned when I showed the dual feeding system, you could either feed coke in, and if you set the levers right, you could feed 100% coke, or you could feed it in fractions depending on where you put the slide gates.\n\nAnd if you have a shutdown for whatever reason—if a major strike or major catastrophe or a major loss of base product or something, that you had to shut the unit down and in a hurry you might have to shut it down, without sufficient help and so forth... you could, once you set the gates and so forth, you could start filling the unit with coke and then at the end of a day's time you would have the complete unit shut down, full of coke! And it would be safe that way, because of the fact that the fused silica did not crack up on ya'. Well, you could never do that with a modern slot-type coke oven. Once you start those, you have to continue running them.\n\nThis, I think, would be a good feature for modern industry, to have a unit that could be started up and shut down with such ease. And it would not take a big crew to do it—it just could take the normal operating crew, and they could shut it down without getting their hands dirty, except for movin' a few slide valves that might not have been automated.\"\n\nIf you've made it this far, thanks for reading!",

    "text": "I’m in Southeast Asia running a small precision design and manufacturing company focused on optics. We do everything in house from design to machining to assembly.\n\n\n\nHere, a fresh graduate mechanical engineer makes about 600 to 800 dollars a month. At a top national company maybe 1,400. I hire new design engineers at around 750 dollars a month, which is roughly 9,000 dollars a year. That’s basically the same as just one month of a US engineer salary at 8k to 10k.\n\n\n\nI honestly can’t figure out how that’s possible. It’s not that we want to underpay people, it’s simply not realistic here. And other positions like machinists or CAM programmers are also paid very high salaries in the US, not just design engineers. If I tried to pay US level salaries my payroll alone would be close to 40,000 dollars a month.\n\n\n\nEven if we priced our products the same as in the US, for example 5,000 dollars each, we can realistically produce about 5 pieces a month. That’s 25,000 dollars in revenue, which doesn’t even cover payroll, let alone overhead and profit. On top of that, around 98 percent of our customers are already based in the US, so it is not a matter of charging a different market.\n\n\n\nSo how do US companies actually manage this? Is it only because of the size of the market, higher pricing power, or something else in the economics that I’m missing? I’d really love to hear from engineers or managers in the US about how your companies make the numbers work.",

The right side would be a second piece of plywood, cut to fit the curve of the stairs and hinged so it can be folded back onto the other piece and lifted to open. \n\nMy idea would be to have a hook or clasp on the upper railing by the desk which would connect to a handle on the plywood so it could be safely locked in the upright position. The bottom side would then be covered with sound deadening panels to reduce the noise between rooms and to give privacy to the upstairs room. \n\nI think my idea could be accomplished for under $150 and would be simple, economical and effective while still looking good if done with a touch of creativity.

    "text": "Hello everyone, sorry for the delay. I've been busy on vacation and was slowly organizing the data. I will run through the entire methodology and include all filtered and raw data as well in the links afterwards. I will also give a quick TDLR at the end for those that do not want to read the entire thing, since there will be lots of graphs and etc. The international one will be next weekend, since I have to adjust for currency and much harder to figure out some of the other things like pension or 401k. This took over 6 hours to filter and write.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThere was a lot of filtering involved. For many of the trend lines, I assumed a linear regression and filtered many of the outliers. This was because they would overly skew the data to one side or not. Feel free to use the data to edit them yourself, but it did take awhile. Let's go through the main adjustments for cost of living (COL).\n\n1. Numbeo used NYC as 100, which of course skews every number high. Therefore, after looking through many different websites, I used the average adjustment of NYC (which in Numbeo is 100) is 35% higher than the US median. This means that I basically just divided the COL number by 65, which means if you are higher than median, the salary will adjustment up. For instance, if the COL was 95 for SF, then 95/65 = 1.46, and a 100k salary/1.46 =68.5k\n2. 401K also had many issues. There was a variety of numbers and specific cases, so I just assumed pension was 5% if no number given, many of the 1-10 I assumed 1%-10%, 0.5 I assumed was 50% and etc. Maybe they were wrong, but some of the data were taken out, since they were outliers and the goal was to find a general trend line for correlations with data.\n3. Bonus was also the same, some bonuses were insanely high 500k+ for lower base salary (200K), so I took those out to more center the data.\n\n**Results:**\n\n**Section 1**: Let's go with the base salary results with no adjustments.\n\nnote: w/ just means with, w/o is just withoutHere are the findings based on the trend-line:Here are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/3cem9qreuefe1.png?width=719&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a3fafbc94357fa06890c9f3625c86b2aaba4773\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 83k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 100k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 120k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 136.7k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 158.2k/yr\n\nNo good data after 20 YOE, so I didn't really count anything after that. It does seem like salary does go higher to 175k/yr+, but too few points for a conclusion\n\n**Conclusion**: Endgame ME salary actually does not stop at 130k, after 18 YOE, it does reach 150k+/yr range. In other words, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.\n\n**Section 2**: Now let's do Total Overall Compensation (base + bonus +%401k match) with cost of living (COL) adjustment.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/l2vk6pdhuefe1.png?width=781&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=91cdee8bb261b468cdc23b7a466d73b323f0b8da\n\nHere are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 91.4k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 115k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 141.6k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 165.1k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 194.5k/yr\n\nNo good data after 20 YOE, so I didn't really count anything after that.

They are not known for high salaries:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/sn1lbxwkuefe1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1493fd664a806c86af89532f173125fa8d5a79bd\n\nHere are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 81k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 97.8k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 116.7k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 133.3k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 154.5k/yr\n\n**Conclusion**: Endgame ME salary actually does not stop at 130k, after 18 YOE, it does reach 150k+/yr range. In other words, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x11wafjnuefe1.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=935f1b552fbca4c606b39ae54de92c76c5081574\n\nHere are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 83.9k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 104.7k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 128.2k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 149.1k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 175.1k/yr\n\n**Conclusion**: Endgame ME TOC actually does not stop at 150k, after 18 YOE, it does reach 200k+/yr range. In other words, it's not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.\n\n**Section 4**: What are the highest paying industries: Tech &amp; Oil &amp; Gas remains the top:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/qspnl2yquefe1.png?width=721&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9385dfc7b66033c61ebc0af1af19b4ba743a141\n\nFor Tech Only: Here are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 87k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 116.8k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 150.4k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 180.3k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 217.7k/yr\n\n**Conclusion**: Tech still pays top dollar still. Looks like the base salary continue to goes up to 225k+/yr.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/crgjocgsuefe1.png?width=784&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98a5f0faab63ccb467351e4326d999610e394ecb\n\nFor Tech Only: Here are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 78k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 125.5k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 179.2k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 227k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 286.6k/yr\n\n**Conclusion**: Tech still pays top dollar even with insane COL adjustment, which is about 35% down for NYC and 30% down for San Fransisco. Looks like the TOC continue to goes up to 300k+/yr.\n\n**Oil and Gas** will remain a close 2nd:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ydw03ggwuefe1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=aaa7f9e7d70fa506f2cfd918520f2f33e5192ea7\n\nFor Oil &amp; Gas Only: Here are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 82.4k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 104.5k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 129.4k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 151.5k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 179.1k/yr\n\n**Conclusion**: Oil &amp; Gas Pays top dollar. Looks like the base salary continue to goes up to almost 200k+/yr.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/hjzhx3vxuefe1.png?width=783&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=09b51d623166846e56fa5d7a22557514532df920\n\nFor Tech Only: Here are the findings based on the trend-line:\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 84.9k/yr\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 125.7k/yr\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 171.6k/yr\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 212.4k/yr\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 263.4k/yr\n\n**Conclusion**: Oil &amp; Gas still pays top dollar probably with the help of the COL adjustment, since the places are more rural and increases the relative salary. Looks like the TOC continue to goes up to 250k+/yr.\n\n**Section 5**: What are the findings on job hops. This remains a bit more difficult, since I could only pick the same YOE and number of job hops. Therefore, I only used the 5 and 10 YOE vs number of job hops since they the most data and only for Aerospace/defense and Manufacturing so outliers will not skew the data.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/u3mgp8s5vefe1.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=45843af1d8d9ea40a011a8fb7674c9b99bd4e4e0\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/x9pdjgr4vefe1.png?width=716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bfed637183b364be4bb616b1bfab7fc4d4d46f05\n\n**Conclusion**: So kind of weird that for younger employees, they are jumping more. Nonetheless, it does seem for the same industry, job hoping does seem to give 3k/job hop for 5 YOE and 6k/job hop for 10 YOE. Therefore, it does make sense for job hops.\n\n**Section 6**: What is the average PTO (so many was unlimited, which is very hard to count. I will just give a percentage of unlimited and then graph the rest:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/84fi2n58vefe1.png?width=720&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2c77af212a0b8ceae7e83b90e91b4aca79dacac4\n\nEntry (0-1 YOE) = 16.5 days (which includes sick days, but not holidays which is 10 days in US)\n\nExperienced (3-5 YOE -&gt; using 4) = 18.3 days\n\nMid-level (7-10 YOE-&gt; using 8.5) = 20.3 days\n\nSenior/Advanced (10-15 YOE-&gt; using 12.5) = 22 days\n\nPrincipal (15-20 YOE -&gt; 17.5) = 24.2 days\n\nTotal Unlimited is 158/1026 or 15.4%\n\n**Conclusion**: So US doesn't have that bad vacation schedule. Most start at 15 days+ at entry and it slowly builds up to around 20 days after 15 YOE. Adding 10 days which is 30 days, basically like a month of vacation, so it's not that bad. Also, 15%+ has unlimited, which like my company is around 6-8 weeks, unless you are leadership and maybe can negotiate more.\n\n**Section 7**: Average work hours in US:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/b1rkwvae4efe1.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8dcd02ad44e805666a2a6aa1c37465baff4d6230\n\n**Conclusion**: most work 40 hours a week 80%+.\n\n**Section 8**: % remote vs. in Office\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/btflr3lg5efe1.png?width=959&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4de3795dac6a8f23e05f9c599d19539db4128066\n\n**Conclusion**: It seems that about 30%+ is 100% in person, with little or no remote possibility. Just for reference, for 100% remote it was about 7% of the workers.\n\n**Section 8**: % 401k Match\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ziynkcuh6efe1.png?width=758&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7f09096f05dcc178f5317929e5e89ef50cfeb18b\n\n**Conclusion**: It seems that most of the 401k match is around 2.5% - 6% with some outliers at the tail end.\n\n**Section 9**: Health Insurance\n\nSo really hard to quantify, since way too complicated. I just asked general questions and here is the graph:\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ed53y08m7efe1.png?width=611&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d4fd65d3c08002c2596e58a40042c7b1b551e05\n\n**Conclusion**: Most have average health insurance. Some have good insurance. Poor and free is in the minority.\n\n**Section 10**: Word Cloud of Cons\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/4ijq0pw98efe1.png?width=1123&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=4dff96ff093aaa52fab6102bc648184dd45e8199\n\n**Conclusion**: Seems to be salary and work are the biggest cons. Management, stress, low \"salary\" and commute is bad.\n\n**Section 11**: Word Cloud of Pros\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ljfc7hhs8efe1.png?width=974&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b9200db2207efef16de69f1f621d6537cc7d4726\n\n**Conclusion**: It seems work is also the most interesting, surprisingly, haha. There does seem to be balance, flexibility and satisfaction.\n\n**Data Analysis Insight:** US BLS says the median wage for all ME in US is $99.5k/yr in 2023, so you can just assume 100k/yr in 2024. The median income in our survey is 103k/yr. Now, let's account for age, so the median age of our survey is 29 vs in US is 40. Now, we don't have enough data for those around 40, but you could estimate based on 18 YOE, which has a median salary of #131k/yr. Now, US BLS says $157k/yr is top 10% and $64.5k/yr is bottom 10% so assuming an power curve since that is how salaries are skewed, 131k/yr is about the 73.6% percentile or slightly less than the top 25% of ME. **In short, the survey represents the top 26.4% of ME in the US.**\n\n**TDLR**: Salary for ME caps around 150k/yr+ and can go to 200k/yr+ after 20 YOE for select industries. No ME is not dying and salary progression is still decent. It's just not as lucrative as before.\n\n**Past Posts**:\n\n2024 US ME Salary Results: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1dhmln3/2024\\_mechanical\\_engineering\\_salary\\_survey\\_results/](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalEngineering/comments/1dhmln3/2024_mechanical_engineering_salary_survey_results/)\n\n2025 US Survey Raw Data: [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WDRmYACurAgbItxhzvJM0moHU5hHoN56Ot-yrUw6Bmg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WDRmYACurAgbItxhzvJM0moHU5hHoN56Ot-yrUw6Bmg/edit?usp=sharing)\n\n2025 US Survey Analysis and Graphs Data: [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tnHI4KazkOlDLzyWUpdIiGKQ5sN3jFKE/edit?usp=drive_link&amp;ouid=107665707298176383133&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true)",

    "title": "A counter to the pessimism on salary and career progression &amp; Some practical advice",
    "text": "Before I start, my advice is only applicable to the US. EU and Canada MEs get it worse I know.\n\nI have 7.5 YOE. I recently started my 4th job which has brought my base cash compensation to 200k and 240k total comp. I moved from a 165K cash comp/180k total job at an established, mid-sized aerospace company in the CA Bay area to a mid-sized but well funded and well known aerospace startup in the LA area, with a slight tiny COL drop.  My title band went from L3 out of 6 to L3 out of 5 but I don't really care too much about that; there's people I can learn from and people I can ~~make do bitch work~~  mentor which is more important.\n\nI'm the type that'll continuously apply to jobs every once in a while or entertain recruiters even if the ship isn't on fire and I'm not actively looking to leave. I've also always been actively involved on interview panels or as an interview screener so I have an up to date and rounded perspective from both the hiring and applicant side. This interview cycle I only applied to 4 jobs: all via recruiters, 3 selected for interviews and 2 offers received.\n\nOur profession shouldn't be envying the ~~code monkeys~~ SWEs. You see the glamourous 300K total comp salaries at MAANG. You don't notice the startups paying 80K in downtown SF or the Ycomb rugpulls that hire 5 dudes and liquidate right after the founder buys a Model S plaid. The former is also the reason big tech is eager to offshore the moment they can.\n\nOn the contrary, we are much, much harder to offshore or displace via immigration. Don't be like the whiney ~~code monkeys~~ SWEs that blame all their misfortunes on immigration. I am a naturalized citizen, my first 2 jobs were before I got my green card. For those that don't have to check the \"Will you ever require visa sponsorship\" box in a job app, you will never understand exactly how large a handicap visa holders face for the same job.\n\nThat being said, there are a few things we can learn from the ~~code monkeys~~ SWEs to improve our overall compensation and employment culture. I don't think the SWE lifestyle of 2020-2022 where everyone with 2 YOE was getting senior titles and job hopping every 8 months for 10% pay bumps is sustainable or healthy, but I think many in the ME field need to adjust their mentality and approach.\n\n1. Being inflexible about relocation especially during early career. This is the No.1 thing that annoys me about the graduated-last-year-still-no-job posts. Your father, his father and his grandfather all lived and died in Bumfuckville, Corn Growing County of Nowhere state in the Midwest, cool. Except you're the first one in your family line who graduated in designing machinery and no one in the next 100 miles manufacturers anything except meth. If your industry has hubs in WA, CA, TX, FL and CO, statistically that is where your first few jobs will be. Yes your cost of living doubles but guess what your net income and net savings increase because prevailing wage is also proportionally higher in those states.\n\n\n2. Being overly attached to an employer. No, don't job hop every 6 months and put \"Ex company 1,2,3,4....\" in your Linkedin title like a SWE. But you should interview every once and a while a year after starting a new job. A. it keeps your interview skills sharp so you don't stumble on that beam question in front of your dream employer B. you get a better idea of your actual market value. My philosophy has always been be ready to leave after year 1 if things are bad, be opportunistic after year 2, and be determined to leave after year 3 if you aren't getting solid raises and promotions. Don't feel bad about the manager guilt tripping you saying backfilling and replacing you is hard. The time to value you was before you found another offer, not after you put in 2 weeks. If they actually do value you, offer to contract/consult part time.  You have second thoughts about leaving because it would set back a program by a few months. If you know you aren't being monetarily valued at a company, do you think they would hesitate for a minute to lay you off?\n\n\n3. Trying to \"prove your worth\" to a broken company. If you notice a company promotes on politics not merit, chances are you won't be the exception to that role. You being exceptional at GD&amp;T is not going to dislodge Sr Director of KissAss. And even if you did play the politics game and got promoted, do you really want to stay? Do you trust the company to remain financially viable in the long term while your skills rust away? Try a few times to do the right thing, if it doesn't work out see point 2.\n\n\n4. Being stagnant in skills. If you're still pumping out the same drawings after 3 years you're likely still getting paid the same as 3 years ago. Notice what skills get paid more at your job. Start actively encroaching their projects. When their SME gets overloaded or behind schedule offer to \"help\". Ask the company to pay for training and certification. You need to earn your advancement, not just apply for it.",

    "title": "27 y/o Mech Eng Bachelor’s struggling to get an actual engineering job - have I screwed myself?",
    "text": "Hi all,\n\nI’m a 27-year old who graduated with a bachelor’s degree in ME four years ago. I’m a certified Engineer Intern in my state, but I have struggled to land an actual engineering job in my career.\n\nI graduated magna cum laude, but I neglected to do internships while in college. I however worked on a rocketry project in college for my senior design project, and after I graduated, I worked freelance for a company in California as a product designer while I searched for an engineering job. It took me a year and a half to land just a contract job as a drafter. I worked with Company B for nearly 3 years and I interviewed with them several times for a full-time position as an engineer before my contract got terminated and I got laid off. I’m currently searching for full-time jobs in engineering, particularly in the aerospace industry, and I just got turned down for a position for a company that I interviewed with that I really liked.\n\nI’m very competent in drafting, but it involves little engineering, and it’s not something I want to do forever. I want to start doing actual engineering work and I am worried that I have probably screwed myself here. Is there still hope for me to get a position as an engineer, or am I stuck doing drafting work forever?",

I feel like I'm dramatically more valuable to the company than I was when I was fresh out of school 6 years ago but I only make like 28% more. The wider data on pay progression for engineers is the same. \n\nIf you look at something like lawyers or software developers or actuaries or marketing people, the really talented, experienced ones are making like 5-6x what entry level ones make.

I actually completed the initial prototype for the design in 2 weeks. No one could really believe it, but it was completed. I then spent the next 2 years developing this product in to something that could go in to production. 4 trips to China, lots of effort. Finally, as of 3 weeks ago, the product was ready. Perfect. Everything in line, everything looked good. Truly a first of its kind product in my field, a one and only product that can be developed in to its own system.\n\nToday, the project was cancelled. Our company got bought out by a billionaire who likes to have his hands on every project.\n\nI was going to get multiple patents with my name on them (and the company name as well), and now I can't. I was hoping to use this experience, and the proof of my engineering knowledge and experience through the patents to move through my career. I guess not.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading my rant. I feel expendable, and useless.\n\n-EDIT-\n\nOne of you took the liberty to have Reddit Care Resources reach out to me. I'm not in any way going to harm myself.

    "title": "Senior ME struggling to mentor junior ME.",
    "text": "I'm about 10 years into my career and have transitioned into more of a senior engineer role. For a while, I had the senior title, but no one to actually lead, as we did not have any junior engineers. We hired a junior engineer straight out of college ~2 years ago and we have been struggling to grow his independence and skill set. Our business was extremely slow the first year of his employment and I think that stunted his growth. \n\nEven after 2 years, I still find I have to be *very* specific with any direction I give to this junior engineer. For example, I recently asked him to design some brackets to mount sensors to a conveyor. His bracket designed caused the sensor to slightly overhang the guide rail and clip the product as it passes by. Granted, I missed this detail when I checked over his work, but his response was that I never told him the sensors shouldn't hit the product. *sigh* \n\nIn my opinion, good managers take accountability and don't blame their subordinates, but in this case, making sure the sensors don't hit the boxes feels like common sense to me? His deflection upsets me. I understand if he just forgot to check it. I recently cost the company thousands because I missed a single digit in a 15 digit part number. It happens. I just wish he took accountability and learned he needs to pay attention to the small details, even if I don't explicitly state them. \n\nWe struggle to utilize him to support our projects because he needs so much hand holding and every little detailed spelled out to him. He asks questions, but the questions often feel like he is trying to flex his knowledge, rather than actually understand the problem. There are a few people at our company who refuse to work with him because he acts like he knows everything and talks over subject matter experts. \n\nWe have another support engineer who is fantastic. He is roughly a decade older than the junior mention above. I can give him a high level view of what I want accomplished and he will easily fill in all the gaps. Sometimes, he does miss small details I fail to point out, but his oversights tend to be on more niche aspects of the design that only I, the lead engineer, am familiar with, so I have no issue taking accountability for those mistakes.\n\n I get that experience comes with time in the industry, I am just struggling with how to grow this guy into a more useful junior engineer. Anyone have advice?",

But as soon as I entered, things didnt not go how I expected.\n\n**THE COMPANY:** High turnover, insanely toxic and weak management, strong union that refuses to do anything. I've already had three different \"permanent\" managers in my 2 years here. Somehow I'm the 2nd oldest in tenure right now in my 4 man engineering team lol. Its a revolving door.\n\n**THE JOB:** The small \"engineering\" team is expected to do everything, from the normal (improvements, troubleshooting, cost reduction, projects, reliability, major maintenance, assisting in breakdowns) to the not so expected (responsible for personally training the hourly staff, supervise the floor, and being a mechanic and turning wrenches alone during breakdown events. basically being a salaried union worker with none of the protections). The workload seems insane. It feels like Im a glorified production supervisor/mechanic/operator, while also completing engineering duties.\n\n**THE QUESTION:** I understand as an entry level worker, you're expected to have a rougher \"get dirty\" job. I dont want to come off as entitled at all as a fresh grad but is this normal for manufacturing engineering? I have no point of comparison right now since this is my first job. Does it really get better from here? Is this a common/normal experience? Cause if this is the normal experience, then Im seriously considering switching into design lol. **PS Im 100% leaving this company, but wondering if I should give manufacturing engineering another chance.**",

I did get one offer, but it was again in the bottom 10% for salaries with my experience (60k) and with an expensive commute, 1/4 of my salary would be lost just on the commute and the work itself was fit for someone with a trade school degree not a university degree so it would set me back even more so I declined.

    "text": "Apologies if this is a common topic on here - feel free to point me elsewhere if there are other similar posts. \n\nIs anyone aware of good resources or ideas for non-masters-degree continued education options? Things like trainings, newsletters, mini-courses or certifications, etc. or even just good books to read (like things that can be read casually, on a kindle for example) that are a good way to keep your skills/knowledge sharp, or branch out into new topics too, but without the time and financial commitment of a masters degree or similar pursuit. I suppose I could always dig out my old textbooks, I’m sure there’s plenty in those that I’m rusty on &amp; could stand to refresh a bit, but that honestly seems a bit intimidating without some sort of course structure to direct the learning a bit at least. \n\nI know some other professions have pretty well-established and formalized continuing education requirements, and thus tend to have pretty good options for how to satisfy them, but I’ve always felt like engineering is a bit lacking in that area (unless I’m just not plugged into the broader profession in the right way). For reference, I’m probably what you’d call on the border between early to mid career, having graduated with my bachelors almost 10 years ago &amp; been working ever since at a few different companies. I’ve toyed with the idea of a masters degree sooner or later but certain personal commitments make it tough to imagine carving out the time for one any time in the near future, but I feel like I’m not learning as much as I did early on in my career so I’m just trying not to stagnate. Any and all thoughts would be sincerely appreciated!",
