    "text": "Have you ever had a moment while driving that just felt like an absolute fever dream?\n\nI just did tonight.\n\nDrunk dude blew a stop sign, ran straight into the side of my DOT bumper as I was passing.\n\nI watched in my side mirror as he ripped most of the front end off his vehicle, and while I was pulling over just drove off into the darkness.\n\nI go back to check on him and he’s gone, but employees of the store that it happened by are outside picking up debris off the road and a witness pulls over to corroborate my story to the cops.\n\nBefore the cops showed up the driver of the car stumbles up out of nowhere complaining that I just totaled his vehicle.  We are all asking if he’s okay but could tell something was off.  Cops show up shortly after he did.\n\nOne takes me aside to get my info/story while the other goes with the drunk dude.  As the officer is checking over my registration he looks up and says “oh shit, they’re fighting!” And runs off.\n\nThe drunk dude had starting brawling with the other officer.  As I look up the drunk guy is down the road a bit from where we just were and being taken to the ground.\n\nShortly after what I can only assume the whole towns department rolls up and I knew my night had just gotten that much longer already.\n\nHad to fill out a witness statement form and wait another hour as they finished the reports before being cut loose.  I still have no clue where he ditched his vehicle at.\n\n\nTLDR:  Drunk guy blows stop sign, uses my DOT bumper to remove the front end of his car.  drunk guy flees scene, returns on foot, and shortly after cops arrive starts fighting them.\n\nI was basically pinching myself the whole time trying to see if I was dreaming.\n\nAnyone else have any crazy stories?\n\n",

    "text": "I’m at a Walmart and I noticed a young dude go from one door to the next. As I was backing into my door he stopped and stood there and when I got done backing he came up to me and asked me how I did it. Come to find out he’s been on his trainers truck for 2 weeks and the trainer is giving him shit for not knowing how to perfectly back yet. He said he has to pull up a few times and he’s not confident because he’s not getting enough backing opportunities and the trainer expects him to know how to do it because it’s been 2 weeks. We all learn at different paces and I’ve seen guys who’ve been out here for years that have trouble backing into spaces sometimes. This is a Walmart so you know there’s tons of space but imagine what’s gonna happen when he gets somewhere with limited space. This guy should be backing every time that truck needs to go in reverse and practicing at the end of every shift. I told him to get a new trainer. I hit 2 years yesterday and I remember how terrible my trainer was. Some stuff you learn as you go, backing being one of them but this is a dangerous job and the last thing a trainee needs is to feel as though they’re being rushed to learn how to handle the vehicle. We all started somewhere and trainers need to remember that when they have trainees careers in their hands. \n\nTLDR: Stop rushing your trainees and remember where you started. ",

    "text": "Hey drivers. Figured I’d post my salary for this year and maybe hope answer some questions for people googling Walmart drivers. I’m on 5/2 5/3 schedule (5 days on 2 days off 5 days on 3 days off) I work in the North East out of a grocery dc. I’ve been at Walmart for 2 years now and I really like it. Being on a 5/2 5/3 schedule means I work less than other drivers \n\n(example 5/2 schedule I would work 2 days less a month than them but I have off 2 extra days which is really nice but I can’t extend a day a week which usually gives a bonus of at least 175 dollars in my area since I share 2 trucks with 2 other drivers.)\n\nSome of you may ask how slip seating is and I don’t have an issue with it. We keep the truck very clean and we use the microwaves, phone holders, etc that we all bought and have no issues. \n\nI want to say a couple things about this years pay. I had off for 6 weeks for my sons birth and was making 1000 less a pay check. (Walmart gives this time off as parental leave fully paid based on your average day pay ADP and my ADP was a lot less then.) The final thing I want to say is if I was on a 5/2 schedule I can expect realistically to make an extra $10,000 without extending.  That being said it all depends on the individual drivers work ethic. \n\nI really hope this may have helped someone googling out there.",

    "text": "I’m not just talking about recruiters or job ads exaggerating pay, that part’s obvious. I mean the public perception and even what people in the industry tell each other. There’s this narrative that everyone breaks six figures after a few years, but based on the folks I’ve met and the discussions in this sub, very few actually hit that number.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary is around $57k, which honestly feels low, but still gives a better picture than the hype. I made about $70k my first year, but that was doing flatbed, which definitely pays more than van/reefer. Even now, I’m on a dedicated drop-and-hook account at 70¢ per mile running Portland to Boise/Sacramento, and I average roughly $1,500 a week before tax, about $78k a year. I don’t see many positions with earning potential much higher than that, especially not for dedicated work that’s drop-and-hook.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the bigger money is in local work. Being an owner-operator can obviously be big money too. Not complaining, just an observation. There’s a ton of misconceptions and way too much hype about this line of work. That hype is a whole different rabbit hole too. I enjoy what I do for the most part, but yeah… it’s definitely overrated compared to how people talk about it. Especially in regards to people making the switch from white collar jobs (not that I’ve ever had a white collar job though). \n\nKinda second guessing my career choice a bit too as I’m sure we all day at some point lol but I certainly could just be thinking the grass is greener on the other side of the pasture. \n",

    "title": "After 5 Long Years, It's Finally Gone",
    "text": "Way back in 2020, I thought I could be slick and get away with smoking with my friends off the clock of my cushy local job. Never before or at work and only at home as my way to relax and unwind after a long day. I didn't drink or do anything else so in my mind I figured as long as long as I never got hurt or hurt somebody or got in an accident I would be fine. Wishful thinking of a young idiot, I know. When it came time that I needed to find new employment, due to no longer being able to tolerate my management and some of my co-workers, I promptly quit smoking for a good 2 months, took OTC drug tests until they came back clean, and started putting in applications. I thought I was good to go. Little did I know, however, thay the tests you take from DOT are a lot more sensitive than the ones you can buy at a store. They popped me with 0.18 micrograms of THC still left in my system after 10 weeks of being clean. I later found that the tests I was buying for myself only showed positive down to 0.5 micrograms, whereas the DOT tests can detect down to 0.15, and I'd screwed myself. I'd already quit my other job, not that they'd take me back, and now I've not only lost my CDL but the new job I was depending on making a smooth transition into as well. Needless to say it was a very rough self-inflicted period of my life.\n\nI had to pay over $1,000 for a SAP (Substance Abuse Professional) and take about 15 hours of classes to reinstate my CDL, followed by almost 3 years of regular drug testing that I also had to pay for while being observed by the doctor for every single one of them. I also became borderline unhirable despite over half a decade of experience, despite having a squeaky clean record aside from this drug violation. The only jobs I could get have been OTR jobs with small companies that've run me to death because they know I can't go just anywhere. Forced dispatch on some of the worst loads you could ever imagine. Paying me far less than what I'm worth at my experience level. Pressuring me to run past my clocks or use multiple log books when I don't want to (I've stood my ground on this twice before and have lost jobs because of it). Just truly terrible awful awful management. The company I'm with now has been a godsend compared to the guys I drove for in my first 3 years after the violation. They treat me well and i feel respected enough, but still, I hate being OTR and it's been miserable knowing I live in a city where local work is abundant that pays equal or more than my salary but no company would touch me with a 10ft pole, and rightly so. It's been rough, and it's entirely on me.\n\n\nWell, as of today, those 5 years of hell come to an end. My record finally stands clean and I'm free to start applying to jobs that keep me home and come off the road for good, and I couldn't be happier. \n\nI wanted to share this story as a cautionary tale for those career drivers that try to skirt the system. That think they won't get caught. Believe me, my friend, it will catch up to you and you will pay for it. FMCSA and the insurance companies take these drug violations extremely seriously and if you want to be in this industry then I'm sorry but you HAVE to stay clean. If you can't do that, then you're probably better off in some other field. \n\nI've already put in 10+ applications for local jobs in my area and I really can't put into words just how relieved I feel to be getting out of this truck soon. Thank you all for letting me share my story and my excitement with you as I put my past and stupid mistakes behind me and look forward to a brighter future for myself and my family. ",

And I'm highly interested but need to talk to the wife. \n\nDetails as follows: \n\nPay - $450 per day. \nDouble pay if drive more than 450 miles a a day. Triple if more than 600 miles. \n\n$100 to get vehicle washed. \n\n$50 per diem and stay in hotels nightly. \n\nHis checks are $2600-4200 weekly. This is all W2 employment. I've known him 7 out 8 years and have 100% trust in him. \n\nThe down side, it's typically long time out. He left in June and won't be back until late October. \n\nThe next part is May 2026 to September 2026. \n\nMy relationship is solid, we have a home together and two cats. I'm making it with my current job.  I don't have a ton of money but I'm stable. \n\nThis new job, I can make my yearly salary in 4 months and then take another job in the off season. \n\nShe's worried about stability, and being gone for that long. I brought it up yesterday and she didn't shut it down immediately, instead saying if it's what I want. \n\nSo I'm looking forward to hearing stories from seasoned drivers, wives, etc  I need to make sure my relationship doesnt fall apart. That's a priority. ",

    "text": "A company will try and convince you to stay but it’s only a distraction for them to find a replacement. They will terminate you and boy is it hard to explain that when you’re looking for work. My advice if things seem a little sketchy like for example: poor employee retention and contractors getting more work it’s time to leave. Especially if you make a big check and your boss says “you broke the bank” but yet he has the money to pay double for the contractors coming there? It’s probably time to start looking elsewhere. He doesn’t care about his drivers and it’s another reason why most people quit at my company. They want you to work for nothing just to satisfy their finances especially if it’s a small company I can guarantee every family member in that office is on a fixed salary.  ",

Carvana is setting me up with an interview. I’ve tried to research them but most of the reviews are old from when the drivers made salary and 4 day weeks and as far as I know, they did away with that. Does anybody work there now that can provide feedback?\n\nOr should I look into other companies such is United Roads or USAL?",

    "text": "Hello everyone, new to the sub, and new to the industry.\n\nI'm currently doing my OTR training for Werner, I lucked out and got a pretty cool trainer doing the Dollar General route around Texas/OK/Arkansas.\n\nOnce I'm done training I'll be starting the Dollar Tree Western Flex account. I'll be getting hourly pay, CPM, and a modest trailer unload rate. These all combined, they told me my weekly pay would be about 1500 pre-tax, for a yearly salary of about 77k (pre-tax).\n\nNow I'm not naive enough to believe them and understand that it will likely be in 68k range as that's the scale they advertised for the job when I took it (68-77k).\n\nMy question is, after doing a lot of reddit searching, I'm seeing tons of people talking about \"fuck trucking they lie and you'll really be making 700-800 a week\" and it's got me a little nervous. This is a major lifestyle change and if that's the \"actual pay\" then I'm not sure how sustainable this will be. I've got a kid to take care of. So is that really what I can expect on the Dollar Tree account, western flex? 800 a week? I'm getting 750 a week just for training so it's hard to believe that I'd only be making $50 more per week once the real work starts.",
