    "text": "September 2025. Anthropic detected suspicious activity on Claude. Started investigating.\n\nTurns out it was Chinese state-sponsored hackers. They used Claude Code to hack into roughly 30 companies. Big tech companies, Banks, Chemical manufacturers, and Government agencies.\n\nThe AI did 80-90% of the hacking work. Humans only had to intervene 4-6 times per campaign.\n\nAnthropic calls this \"the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.\"\n\nThe hackers convinced Claude to hack for them. Then Claude analyzed targets -&gt; spotted vulnerabilities -&gt; wrote exploit code -&gt; harvested passwords -&gt; extracted data, and documented everything. All by itself.\n\nClaude's trained to refuse harmful requests. So how'd they get it to hack?\n\nThey jailbroke it. Broke the attack into small, innocent-looking tasks. Told Claude it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm doing defensive testing. Claude had no idea it was actually hacking real companies.\n\nThe hackers used Claude Code, which is Anthropic's coding tool. It can search the web, retrieve data run software. Has access to password crackers, network scanners, and security tools.\n\nSo they set up a framework. Pointed it at a target. Let Claude run autonomously.\n\nThe AI made thousands of requests per second; the attack speed impossible for humans to match.\n\nAnthropic said \"human involvement was much less frequent despite the larger scale of the attack.\"\n\nBefore this, hackers used AI as an advisor. Ask it questions. Get suggestions. But humans did the actual work.\n\nNow? AI does the work. Humans just point it in the right direction and check in occasionally.\n\nAnthropic detected it, banned the accounts, notified victims, and coordinated with authorities.

    "title": "What I look for in a resume",
    "text": "We get a ton of people posting in the various cybersecurity and IT subs on how hard the job market is. Especially when first starting out. Hundreds of resumes sent each month and no responses. You feel you are a perfect fit for all the job requirements and no responses. I want to help and share my perspective and what goes through my mind on the other side.\n\nI've been hiring in cyber and IT for a bit over 25 years. I feel I've gotten pretty good at reading resumes at this point. I'm currently in cyber as an ISSM and need to hire an engineer to manage my tools. A SIEM, a vulnerability scanner, and an endpoint security solution. The job req just lists these technologies. I am not looking for specific tools as there are tons of them out there. This is a junior role looking for 2 years of experience with degree an associates degree or 4 years without. \n\n**Why I passed on a resume...**\n\n1: Proofread your AI slop. AI can be a handy tool. Don't let it do all the work for you though. Pretty sure you aren't currently employed at three different companies. I'm also pretty sure your current job time of employment isn't \"10/2025 - Current\". When you send a resume it represents the quality of what you consider to be a completed task. If you aren't going to double check your resume you aren't going to double check your work on the job.\n\n2: Get to the point of who you are. Don't have a 6 page resume, that is double spaced, filled with keywords and no substance. \"Responsible for strategic goals in a multifaceted team for multiple sites\". What am I supposed to make out of that? If you aren't able to focus in on your message I'm not sure if you can or if you even have a point when we talk during the day. Will our conversations take forever? Will you be able to ask me for what you need? Yes I am aware of the irony in saying this in a long wall of text post lol. There is a time and place for both. Its not that I feel I am too good for your time, its that I have 6 hours of meetings and 2 hours of doing my actual job I was hired to do. Those 2 hours will include supporting my entire team and everyone deserves support.\n\n3: Bad spelling and grammar. This not only goes back to putting time and effort for quality output, but also you need to show that you can communicate well. I'm understanding that English isn't your first language so I am not looking for perfection. But if I see a lot of red underlines that word or google docs is throwing at me, it did the same to you.\n\n4: Your resume should reflect your job experience. When you are brand new you have to blow out of proportion your contributions. \"Responsible for the vulnerability management of 10,000 computers and improving security posture by 25%\" I get it. You pushed out patches with WSUS or YUM. We all had to start somewhere. However this sort of wording should not be with someone who has 5, 10, or more years of experience and multiple IT related jobs. Tell me your actual accomplishments. If you can't, I'm going to question what you did with all that time. This is a junior role but I am seeing a heck of a lot of over experienced and over qualified people applying. Again, this job market sucks.\n\n5: Job hopping too soon. Its takes about a month to open a job req, conduct interviews, select someone, and then have them give their 2 weeks notice to their existing job. Its then going to take another month to get your equipment and accounts that are needed, for you to learn the team and office dynamics and for you to start contributing. Then probably a 3rd month of needing my or a teammates support. Finally by month 4 of my team being short staffed, you are a net contributor in time vs productivity to the team. This is why people say you should be in a job for 1 year. If you change jobs every 6 months I'll never get my time investment back. I'm understanding that RIFs happen, your previous jobs weren;t a good fit. 1 or 2 quick job hops is understandable. But two in a row and your current job has only been 3 months I'm going to pass on you.\n\n**Why I selected a resume...**\n\n1: Color and formatting. Look I have 2 dozen resumes to go through. They all start looking the same in context and substance and I sometimes read too fast. While I try to be conscious of this and give your resume the time its due, see above 2 hours of my real job a day. I saw a resume yesterday with a blue steel banner and a gray left hand column of skills. It stood out and make me take notice.\n\n2: 2 pages tops. I don't need to know where you went to high school or what your GPA in college was. For senior positions I'll take more pages as long as the pages are applicable to the role.\n\n3: Multifaceted skillset. I list my current needs as job requirements in the req. e,g, the three tools I listed above. However I am also thinking about the future and what technical skills are needed next year. Remember that you are competing for my attention vs all the others. Yes you are a perfect fit for the reqs but someone else might be too, and bring more. \n\n4: Homelab. I get it that we often get stuck in narrow skills and your past jobs didn't let you do anything outside a few things. I also get it that you are starting your career and dont have much job experience. Are you going to let that stop you? A homelab proves you are going to take extra steps to expand your skills. Should you have to do this in addition to college and certificates to get a job? No but clearly there are limited quality jobs for the amount of job seekers out there. Give yourself a leg up against the other resumes I will read. \n\nA homelab also shows that you can problem solve. I'm seeing more and more a big problem with \"learned helplessness\" in the workplace. Show me on your resume you know how to problem solve. We managers hate problems brought to us and nothing was tried. We do appreciate a problem brought to us where you tried X, Y, Z. We dont expect you to know everything. We have more experience than you and we should have answers. But one of my biggest headaches of my career are team members who dont contribute and take up their peers time for unecessary help. \n\nA resume tells a heck of a lot more than you may think. It represents who you are in what you choose to add in, or leave out, how you phrase your skills, and it represents your quality of effort. ",

    "title": "20 Years in IT/InfoSec, Over 1000 Applications In One Year, No Offers, What The ACTUAL Heck Is Going On?",
    "text": "Starting this somewhat crudely, because I want to make the point clear early on - SOMETHING feels wrong right now, specifically with the way that hiring and layoffs keep happening in our industry. I don't care to draw attention to my own personal situation but want to provide some background which will hopefully establish some bonafides.\n\nI got started in IT services doing End-User/Small Business PC diagnosis and repair. I spent approx. 15 years doing various degrees of the IT career ladder (Service Desk, SysAdmin, Network Admin, Systems Engineer, etc.) before finding out how exhausting and soul sucking that was. Having been so tired, I asked around to see what I might be able to take my experience and use it for besides what I was already doing.\n\nThe topic of using the skills in cybersecurity was one that came up quite a bit, being recommended to roles in SecOps. This was in roughly 2020/2021. I took the advice and found a place that let me engage in ransomware remediation (more than I had been doing at my level). I was able to keep that one on my resume for a couple years as I was contracting for them on an as needed basis. The work was AWESOME. I operated as the lead for a MSSP startup that was dealing in mostly reactive manners to ongoing ransomware cases. I got to spend 8-14 hours a day digging into how TA's TTP (Threat Tactic Procedures) changes as the event is happening. Working against some of the largest players at the time in the space (BlackBasta, Conti, Lockbit, etc.)\n\nAfter doing that role for a couple of years, I eventually moved into a more consultant based role where I got to be a bit more proactive (with a healthy bit of reactive mixed in). I got to engage in audits based off of the NIST CSF 2.0 Framework and got to remediate the actions items I found during the audits. I thought that this would surely help me round out my security resume and that if I ever ended up back in the job market I would be better off for it.\n\nTo be fair, I wasn't counting on not having a job at any point (then again, who is?) I was fully committed to this company, when one of their customers got hit w/ ransomware because of a decision one of the previous owners had made in creating local accounts on their exploitable firewall that were eventually found and used - I was the one that spent 80 hours over 7 days in that customers office getting things back up (despite the ESXi host being completely encrypted along with the datastores).\n\nBut alas, bad things tend to come quarterly when your industry is considered a cost-center for most companies. After taking vacation in Nov '24 out of the country, I came back and was told \"We don't have enough work to sustain your bosses salary AND yours, so we are laying you off effective immediately. I was as cordial as possible, returned my equipment, and asked for severance since this was a layoff and not a termination. \"We have never done that in the past, so we won't be doing it now.\"\n\nObviously, as someone who likes the work I do I immediately shifted gears, tried to find as many companies as I could to apply to with the experience I have. Trying to use the 80-90% required experience rule (if you meet 80-90% apply anyway) that I was always taught growing up and on my way into this field. But it really seems to have gone absolutely nowhere.\n\nIt's been 10 months now and I am still looking, very actively at that. I spend hours a day on LinkedIn looking for companies (which is how I found the last 4 roles I had prior to this) to apply to. Even ditching the 80-90% rule in favor for a 100% one. I do OSINT on companies and try to connect and DM hiring managers/recruiters/other employees. Again, adding more time to the already miserable process. I was forced to apply for unemployment, which at this stage has come and went - leaving me with absolutely nothing to bring in income (which I can only imagine based on what I see on LI that several others with similar skills and experience are going through the same).\n\nBut when you look at the people that are specifically in charge of that first level of contact? The recruiters? They are too busy making posts on LI about how they \"can't be humanly expected to view every candidate that submits an application.\" Even better is the \"Just let AI handle it, it'll tell you which ones are the good ones worth reaching out to\" people. Because from what I can see, the ATS doesn't like your resume formatting? Low rank. Doesn't understand the similarities between keywords in your resume/profile and the job description? Low rank. What happens when that does finally get to the recruiters eyes? They call the first 20 in their \"top ranking\" list and schedule them interviews. Everyone else gets a crappily worded message (if they are lucky) about how the company loves that they put their time in but aren't going to even do them the kindness of talking to them before assuming they don't have what they are looking for.\n\nThe hardest part? Now there's all these services that will submit your app for you autonomously, inputting in your data/etc and matching you to whatever keywords you tell it to apply for and basically every AI will write you a resume if you tell it to. So what is really going on? AI is reading the resumes that AI is writing? Nobody is getting work?\n\nThere's people with double my time in the field saying they are seeing the same problem. They aren't getting work either. They get completely ignored when 2-3 years ago they were called early into the process and typically saw all of the processes through to the end.\n\nSO back to the point - what the actual heck is going on? (I'd love to be more animated here)  \nHow many times should you edit your LI profile, your resume, your email header, etc. before everyone stops for a second and recognizes something is wrong. Companies like ISC2 ignoring/not validating 5-year requirements and letting SD people that did PW resets in AD for 5 years pass the mark for their minimum requirements, yet somehow are the expected industry norm now?\n\nHonestly, as much as the work makes me feel like a used towel, I'd rather go back to systems engineering making half the money just to avoid these companies that really feel like walking on eggshells. Which makes me super sad, when I talk to others in the industry they say they love the work too. That it brings them enjoyment or at the least fulfillment. But not working for 10 months? No interviews in the last 3? I just don't know anymore if it feels like the place I can keep trying to stay in when there really doesn't feel like much of a foundation to stand in.\n\nTL;DR Cybersecurity job market in the USA feels very shifty, on constantly unsettling sands. Doesn't matter if you have or don't have experience, people all across the sector are saying it feels impossible to get hired or to even get the time of day from recruiters. It feels like something is broken and wrong, and not sure how else to pinpoint the issue other than it feels like a market created by HR/recruiters who don't actually have any knowledge of what we do but disqualify us based on what their ATS tells them (even if frequently wrong).\n\nEDIT: Before anyone else comments here with the same rough advice let me be clear and save you some time. I already reach out to friends/past co-workers extensively when able. No, I do not have a bad relationship with anyone of my recruiters or past co workers just because I respond negatively to your cookie cutter advice. Yes, I do cater my resume to each job I apply to and have done so for at least six out of the ten months I have been in the market. Yes, my experience goes extensively beyond what is listed in the post because I was trying not to bore everyone with my life's story. If you're that interested, look at the comments and I am sure you can put together some of my experience. No, I have not ever had an issue like this in the past 20 years worth of networking and applying to jobs (short of a 5 month window in 2020 after my contract ended for lack of physical work) or in trying to set up business with customers/clients. Lastly, yes I REALLY have been doing this since I was 12 - it's fine if you got to live a privileged upbringing but if I wanted to make enough to eat and have even the smallest amount of required items to go to school and live a decent childhood  I had to work for it early on. I don't care if \"you read that and immediately thought it was bullshit\" nor do I care if you caught one slip I made while writing the original post on TTP (Tactics, techniques, procedures) in the middle of the night. The reality of the amount of ransomware I have stopped, the amount of attacks I have reversed, the amount of companies that wouldn't have been running if not for my help, the amount of courts that have paid me to be an expert witness, frankly - it's enough proof for me. If it's not enough for you, rather than berate me and tell me I am in the wrong industry or that I \"need to edit my resume\" for the 1000th time, why not instead question others in your own network and ask them if they are going through something similar. Because I would go beyond a shadow of a doubt to say that they'd agree. Everyone I know, 3,5,10,20,25 years of experience is going through this. It's not a matter of us just suddenly forgetting how to make a decent resume or how to communicate with people. To even insinuate that is a fallacy built on your own misconception of the job market. Be it based on your own bias from experience or seeing others. Stop trying to give me unnecessary advice that I didn't ask for and getting upset that I am not reciprocating that.  Because things like \"Edit Resume, Message your network, surely you are just not doing it right\" not only are completely worthless, they're already being done and have been being done for YEARS. They just are not working now, and that is my whole point in this post. ",

    "text": "I've been seeing a lot of people on this subreddit who are immediately wanting to break into IT without putting in the time and effort to get to that position.\n\nMany people think that you can go into a coding or IT bootcamp for a couple weeks and fully expect to start making a 6 figure salary right out of the gate. \n\nI'm here to tell you that while it is possible, it is **extremely** unrealistic. I think a lot of this has to do with the recent cyber craze on social media where influencers are guaranteeing that you will make 6 figures if you just get into cybersecurity/IT. \n\nWith how the job market is right now, it is **crucial** that you have some IT experience on your resume before you think about going into any analyst or engineering position in IT. \n\nThat's why I believe that your rank in the IT market can easily be boosted by taking the shitty help desk IT positions whether it is fully remote, over the phone, or even in-person.\n\nBefore getting the position that I have now, I solely worked as technical support for multiple companies and I have to say that it has helped me get to the position I have today. It helps you build those soft-skills like probing, troubleshooting, and working with people who aren't as tech-savvy to get the information you need to properly help them. While these positions absolutely **SUCK** they will help you land that IT job of your dreams.\n\nI'd like to know what you all think, I'd love to hear different perspectives from current IT professionals and people who are looking into getting into IT.

    "title": "How (almost) any phone number can be tracked via WhatsApp &amp; Signal – open-source PoC",
    "text": "I’ve been playing with the “Careless Whisper” side-channel idea and hacked together a small PoC that shows how you can track a phone’s **device activity state** (screen on/off, offline) via WhatsApp – without any notifications or visible messages on the victim’s side.\n\n\n\n**How it works (very roughly):**  \n\\- uses WhatsApp via an unofficial API  \n\\- sends tiny “probe” reactions to special/invalid message IDs  \n\\- WhatsApp still sends back silent delivery receipts  \n\\- I just measure the round-trip time (RTT) of those receipts\n\n\n\nFrom that, you start seeing patterns like:  \n\\- low RTT ≈ screen on / active, usually on Wi-Fi  \n\\- a bit higher RTT ≈ screen on / active, on mobile data  \n\\- high RTT ≈ screen off / standby on Wi-Fi  \n\\- very high RTT ≈ screen off / standby on mobile data / bad reception  \n\\- timeouts / repeated failures ≈ offline (airplane mode, no network, etc.)\n\n\\*depends on device\n\n\n\nThe target **never sees any message, notification or reaction**. The same class of leak exists for Signal as well (per the original paper).  \n\nIn theory you’d still see this in raw network traffic (weird, regular probe pattern), and on the victim side it will slowly burn through a bit more mobile data and battery than “normal” idle usage.\n\n\n\nOver time you can use this to infer behavior:  \n\\- when someone is probably at home (stable Wi-Fi RTT)  \n\\- when they’re likely sleeping (long standby/offline stretches)  \n\\- when they’re out and moving around (mobile data RTT patterns)\n\nSo in theory you can slowly build a profile of when a person is home, asleep, or out — and this kind of tracking could already be happening without people realizing it.\n\n**Quick “hotfix” for normal users:**  \nGo into the privacy settings of WhatsApp and Signal and turn off / restrict that unknown numbers can message you (e.g. WhatsApp: Settings → Privacy → Advanced). The attack basically requires that someone can send stuff to your number at all – limiting that already kills a big chunk of the risk.\n\nMy open-source implementation (research / educational use only):  [https://github.com/gommzystudio/device-activity-tracker](https://github.com/gommzystudio/device-activity-tracker)\n\nOriginal Paper:  \n[https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194)",

    "text": "So, I spent the week in San Francisco at Microsoft Ignite, and the disheartening message I left with was, \"don't worry about skills - we'll give you agents instead.\"\n\nI'm sure that plenty has already been said about the organizational issues at the conference - the security checkpoints, the keynote shuttles stuck in rush-hour traffic, the box lunches - so I'll just talk about the sessions.  When I went to the RSA Conference in 2016 and 2017, I sat in sessions with titles like \"Effectively Measuring Cybersecurity Improvement,\"  \"The Seven Most Dangerous New Attack Techniques, and What's Coming Next,\" and \"The Changing Face/Fate of Identity.\"  At last week's conference, I heard announcements about Security Copilot agents, Purview/Defender integration using Copilot, and Agent 365, Microsoft's new tool for managing AI agents - and then I heard about them again.  And again.  And again.  The security-and-compliance-focused content was repetitive and almost entirely focused on Copilot.\n\nAlmost everyone on stage was a Microsoft employee.  Executives from large customers would be brought on in the last five minutes to read awkwardly off teleprompters about how Copilot has improved their operations.  Even the one actual panel discussion I attended was moderated by Microsoft product managers who pushed the panelists to talk more about AI.  In a session about Defender for Enterprise (the only session I was in where Copilot wasn't mentioned,) one of the presenters joked that she had to mention AI in the first five minutes.  I assume she was later fired for insubordination.  \n\nYesterday I came across [this post](https://www.darkreading.com/cybersecurity-careers/with-ai-reshaping-entry-level-cyber-what-happens-to-the-security-talent-pipeline-) from Dark Reading titled \"With AI Reshaping Entry-Level Cyber, What Happens to the Security Talent Pipeline?\" It underscores and clarifies a lot of the thoughts I had leaving the conference.  One thing it doesn't address, however, is the next iteration of the digital divide.  Large companies and organizations will spend, spend, spend on agentic AI and create increasingly automated cyber programs.  Small companies, like the one I work for, won't be able to afford it and will do things in very different ways.\n\n(And if you think that the newly-announced free Security Copilot licenses for E5 customers are being distributed equally, know that the day after I got the email from Microsoft about this, I got another email saying that it was a mistake, that my company wasn't actually eligible, that our Security Copilot billing would immediately resume, but we'll apparently be granted licenses \"in the coming months.\")\n\nSuffice to say that while I left the conference better informed about Microsoft's roadmap, I didn't leave it with any new knowledge, skills, or intelligence.  There was nothing worth flying across the country and spending thousands of dollars on.",

You're setting policy for software development at a multi-billion dollar organization and somehow it is ok for you to set security policy... but you don't even know how to write a basic program? It is unsurprising that much of the subsequent security policy is nothing short of asinine.\n\nI'm curious, what have other people's experiences been?

We did an initial blog post about it in early 2024 that ended up here on netsec, however since then it's evolved steadily, so this post summarises at this point in time what it does and how you can use it.  \n  \n**Firstly, what it does:**\n\nTalkback automatically aggregates content from:\n\n* 1000+ RSS feeds\n* Subreddits, blogs, Twitter/X, and other social media\n* Conference/infosec archives (e.g. Black Hat, USENIX, CTFtime, etc.)\n\nThen it enriches and indexes all that data — extracting:\n\n* Infosec categories (e.g. \"Exploit Development\")\n* Topics (e.g. \"Chrome\")\n* MITRE ATT&amp;CK, CVE IDs, and more\n* Short focused summaries of the content\n* It also archives each resource via the Wayback Machine, takes a screenshot, calculates a rank/score, tracks hosting info via Shodan, and builds out cross-references between related items.\n\n**And how you can use it:**  \n  \nThe Talkback webapp gives you a few different ways to explore the system:\n\n* Inbox View – a personalised feed\n* Library View – with powerful filtering, sorting, and full-text search\n* Chronicles – explore content by Week, Month, or Year\n* Bookmarks, Tags, etc.\n* Custom Newsletters, RSS feeds, and a GraphQL API\n\nWe’ve found it incredibly valuable day-to-day, and hope you do too.\n\nCheck it out here: [https://talkback.sh](https://talkback.sh/) \\- happy to hear thoughts, feedback, or feature ideas! ",

    "title": "A bored CISO who wants to do more hands-on work",
    "text": "Over 20 years of experience in Cybersecurity, backed up by several certifications (CISSP, CISM, CISA, CEH, OSCP, GCIH, GPEN, GCFA). I have been working as a SOC Analyst, SOC Lead, Penetration Tester and Red Teamer, Security Architect and GRC Lead in the past, and for the last 6 years as a CISO for two mid-size organizations. I am officially bored. I have come to the conclusion that I dont like the CISO role as much as I thought. I am looking back to my career and although I have been very successful so far in this field, I am not sure there is a role out of those mentioned above that would spark my interest again. I just know that I dont want to deal with organization bs anymore at the CISO/Director level. I got tired of convincing people on the importance of security. But I have bills to pay. A lot of them. So I need to keep going. I have thought of working for myself, maybe as a practitioner freelancer. SOC Analyst and Pentesting/Red Teaming is not what I would like to do. Besides, freelance salaries for those roles are not that great here in Europe where I am located and is hard to find projects as a freelancer in those domains. What would be your suggestion considering my experience and qualifications?\n\nUpdate 1: I am doing a couple of side gigs - Red Teaming is one of those.  \nUpdate 2: I understand some of you would dream to become a CISO. I was one of you. The salary, the reputation, the this and that. So you might see this as a first-world problem. I understand you. And you will understand me once you reach this level. The mix of burnout and boreout, oftentimes overlapping.  \nUpdate 3: Do people realize that CISOs in Europe get significantly less compared to CISOs in the US? Do you realize that I have three people under me who receive much more than I do because they are in the US and I am in the EU? And they deserve it, because they are awesome, smart and they have worked hard. So people who comment that I should retire, I have made a lot of money, I am arrogant and showing off, they have no idea what a CISO of an average company makes in Europe. Unless you work for one of the big names, like Nike, SAP, ASML, Novo Nordisk, Siemens etc, your salary will be very good, but no where near the 6-7 US figures to retire in your 50s. Full disclosure - I work as a CISO for a Belgian company and my annual salary is 120K. I go a bit above this by doing some freelancing side projects like Red Teaming, Executive advisory and teaching at a local university. ",

    "title": "Cybersecurity was my dream… now I’m lost…",
    "text": "**Just want to get this off my chest and maybe ask for some advice…** \n\nMy first job was in Technical Support for a security company. But to be honest, it felt more like a helpdesk role since most of the cases weren’t really technical. The few that were technical were challenging and interesting—but they didn’t come around often. After exactly two years, I decided to apply elsewhere because I felt like I wasn’t growing anymore in that role. Thankfully, I landed a new job as a SOC Analyst.\n\nI spent another two years in that role, and I did learn a lot. But if I were to rate myself from 1 to 10, I’d say I’m around a 6.5—just okay. I wouldn’t call myself great, but I know I work hard and I work smart. Most of my tasks leaned more toward handling false positives than actual threat processing (a lot of whitelisting issues, if you know what I mean).\n\nAround 2023, I started job hunting again. I was searching for more growth and, to be honest, better pay. On top of that, I was also experiencing burnout, which made me decide to finally resign. After about two months of non-stop interviews—literally every single day—I finally got an offer. It genuinely felt like an answered prayer.\n\nI was hired as a Technical Examiner in DFIR at a well-known company in the IR space. This role really expanded my knowledge and made me realize just how vast the field of cybersecurity really is. I got to work with some of the best people in the industry and was exposed to different teams and service lines. I had no plans of leaving anytime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, due to internal company struggles, I was included in a sudden round of layoffs.\n\nNow here’s where I’m struggling—I’ve been finding it really hard to land a new job. My last salary had already reached six figures (PH based), and I’m honestly hesitant to settle for something significantly lower. But at the same time, I’m starting to doubt myself. My resume doesn’t seem to be getting the same traction it used to, and it's making me question whether this path is still meant for me. 😭\n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar? How did you deal with it? Is it worth holding out for a role that matches your previous level, or should I consider pivoting—even if it means starting a bit lower again? Also, do you have any recommendations for free reputable certifications or training resources that I could take? \n\nAny advice or insights would really mean a lot. 🙏\n",

A few specific questions to kick off the discussion:\n\n1.  How long is it taking you to land interviews once you apply? (Are you seeing 1–2% callback rates like juniors, or significantly better?)\n\n2.  Once you get to the interview stage, are companies moving fast or dragging their feet with 6–8 rounds, homework, presentations, etc.?\n\n3.  Salary trends – are you seeing compression at the senior level, or are good roles still paying 2021–2022 money (or even higher)?\n\n4.  Fully remote senior/manager roles: dead, dying, or still out there in decent numbers?\n\n5.  Are layoffs still rippling at the senior level, or is it mostly back to “normal” attrition?\n\n6.  Any noticeable difference between industries (finance/healthcare/gov vs. tech startups vs. MSSPs/consulting)?\n\n7.  Geography – if you’re in the US, are certain regions (TX, FL, NC, CO, etc.) clearly hotter than others right now?\n\n8.  For those who recently switched: what was the deciding factor (money, WLB, remote, title, etc.)?\n\n—\n\nPlease mention (roughly):\n\n•  Your total YOE and current/previous title\n\n•  Main certifications\n\n•  Rough location or “US – fully remote”\n\n•  Whether you’re actively looking or just watching the market\n\nTrying to separate anecdote from trend here – the more experienced voices, the better. No junior/early-career posts please (different market entirely).\n\nThanks in advance – really curious if the “senior talent is still in demand” narrative matches reality on the ground right now.",

    "title": "Why do cybersecurity experts becomes content creator if the field pays well?",
    "text": "As the title suggests, I'm curious, does CyberSec really pay as well as people claim? I've heard from many that while not everyone, a good number of professionals in the field earn six-figure salaries. But then, others say that people in data science tend to earn even more than cybersecurity engineers. So, which one is actually true?\n\nA few months ago, I started considering a career switch. As an artist, I've had very few opportunities and low pay compared to the amount of work I put in. I have no IT background, but I've seen people break into the field without even having a degree. So, I decided to start studying part-time. Even if I don’t land a job soon, at the very least, I'll be equipped with a valuable skill in today’s world.\n\nNow, coming back to my question, while looking for learning resources, I noticed that so many people in CyberSec are also creating content: making courses, running career guidance websites, teaching online, and producing videos. It made me wonder, if there’s really good money in this field, why are so many professionals investing their time in content creation?\n\nI’ve seen the same thing happen in the art industry, but I understand why artists do it. Our jobs don’t pay well, and there’s zero job security, especially with big studios shutting down left and right. So, content creation became a solid backup for many. But why do CyberSec professionals do it? Is it because they want to escape hectic job schedules? Or is the field not as financially stable as people say?\n\nAlso, I want to ask about the skill gap or lack of skilled talent that everyone talks about, does it still exist?\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks alot everyone for responding to this post, I am really overwhelmed by the response, these comments really helped me understand this field more now and have cleared many of my misconceptions (although still confused about few) but anyway thanks for this and apologise my ignorance, I have little to no knowledge about this field so all this questions are purely out of curiousity, I don't mean any disrespect towards anyone.",

    "text": "Hi there everyone, so I am wanting to go back to college and get a degree in computer science. I am a felon in the state of Arkansas and was wondering if anyone knows if this would be a good career choice for me? I have drug charges, some are class A. Would this prevent me from getting jobs in this field? Would this degree be worth pursuing? I am feeling very discouraged lately and like a failure because I feel like I am so so smart and I wasted my potential because I went to prison. Getting a job anywhere has been hard for me due to my record and I heard that computer tech jobs are felon friendly and avg salary in my state is around 60k. Also is getting my degree in computer science better than maybe going to a computer tech bootcamp type of thing? Any recommendations on some tech boot camps if anyone has taken any? Thank you ",

    "title": "Blind Enumeration of gRPC Services",
    "text": "We were testing a black-box service for a client with an interesting software platform. They'd provided an SDK with minimal documentation—just enough to show basic usage, but none of the underlying service definitions. The SDK binary was obfuscated, and the gRPC endpoints it connected to had reflection disabled.\n\nAfter spending too much time piecing together service names from SDK string dumps and network traces, we built [grpc-scan](https://github.com/Adversis/grpc-scan) to automate what we were doing manually: exploiting how gRPC implementations handle invalid requests to enumerate services without any prior knowledge.\n\nUnlike REST APIs where you can throw curl at an endpoint and see what sticks, gRPC operates over HTTP/2 using binary Protocol Buffers. Every request needs:\n\n* The exact service name (case-sensitive)\n* The exact method name (also case-sensitive)\n* Properly serialized protobuf messages\n\nMiss any of these and you get nothing useful. There's no OPTIONS request, typically limited documentation, no guessing `/api/v1/users` might exist. You either have the proto files or you're blind.\n\nMost teams rely on server reflection—a gRPC feature that lets clients query available services. But reflection is usually disabled in production. It’s an information disclosure risk, yet developers rarely provide alternative documentation.\n\nBut gRPC have varying error messages which inadvertently leak service existence through different error codes:\n\n`# Calling` `non-existent\\`\\`unknown service FakeService\\`\\`real service, wrong method\\`\\`unknown method FakeMethod for service UserService\\`\\`real service and method\\`\\`missing authentication token`\n\nThese distinct responses let us map the attack surface. The tool automates this process, testing thousands of potential service/method combinations based on various naming patterns we've observed.\n\nThe enumeration engine does a few things\n\n**1.** Even when reflection is \"disabled,\" servers often still respond to reflection requests with errors that confirm the protocol exists. We use this for fingerprinting.\n\n**2.** For a base word like \"User\", we generate likely services\n\n* `User`\n* `UserService`\n* `Users`\n* `UserAPI`\n* `user.User`\n* `api.v1.User`\n* `com.company.User`\n\nEach pattern tested with common method names: Get, List, Create, Update, Delete, Search, Find, etc.\n\n**3.** Different gRPC implementations return subtly different error codes:\n\n* `UNIMPLEMENTED` vs `NOT_FOUND` for missing services\n* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` vs `INTERNAL` for malformed requests\n* Timing differences between auth checks and method validation\n\n**4.** gRPC's HTTP/2 foundation means we can multiplex hundreds of requests over a single TCP connection. The tool maintains a pool of persistent connections, improving scan speed.\n\nWhat do we commonly see in pentests using RPC?\n\n**Service Sprawl from Migrations**\n\nSDK analysis often reveals parallel service implementations, for example\n\n* `UserService` \\- The original monolith endpoint\n* `AccountManagementService` \\- New microservice, full auth\n* `UserDataService` \\- Read-only split-off, inconsistent auth\n* `UserProfileService` \\- Another team's implementation\n\nThese typically emerge from partial migrations where different teams own different pieces. The older services often bypass newer security controls.\n\n**Method Proliferation and Auth Drift**\n\nReal services accumulate method variants over time, for example\n\n* `GetUser` \\- Original, added auth in v2\n* `GetUserDetails` \\- Different team, no auth check\n* `FetchUserByID` \\- Deprecated but still active\n* `GetUserWithPreferences` \\- Calls GetUser internally, skips auth\n\nSo newer methods that compose older ones sometimes bypass security checks the original methods later acquired.\n\n**Package Namespace Archaeology**\n\nService discovery reveals organizational history\n\n* ‍`com.startup.api.Users` \\- Original service\n* ‍`platform.users.v1.UserAPI` \\- Post-merge standardization attempt\n* ‍`internal.batch.UserBulkService` \\- \"Internal only\" but on same endpoint\n\nEach namespace generation typically has different security assumptions. Internal services exposed on the same port as public APIs are surprisingly common—developers assume network isolation that doesn't exist.\n\n# Limitations\n\n* Services expecting specific protobuf structures still require manual work. We can detect `UserService/CreateUser` exists, but crafting a valid User message requires either the proto definition or guessing or reverse engineering of the SDK's serialization.\n* The current version focuses on unary calls. Bidirectional streaming (common in real-time features) needs different handling.\n\nAvailable at [https://github.com/Adversis/grpc-scan](https://github.com/Adversis/grpc-scan).

    "title": "How common is 1 round of interview in cybersecurity?",
    "text": "I’m not sure if this is an anomaly. So I applied for a 6 figure cybersecurity job in a large well known org in the US, and after only 1 round of interview, in-person, I got a call from the HR Talent Acquisition rep about two hours later that I got the job on the same day. There were about 10 employees in the interview room, including the HR rep. There were a few candidates interviewing that day, and the session was about 1 hour. Here are my questions:\n\n1) How common is it that there’s only 1 round of interview in the cybersecurity world ? There was also the initial HR phone screening, but I don’t count that as a “round of interview” since they were just discussing the position and to see if the salary and everything met my expectation before scheduling it. \n\n2) Is it common for an HR rep to be in the interview room the entire time for in-person interviews? \n\n3) How many rounds was your interview, or how many rounds is it typical for your company if you participate in the hiring process?\n\n\nEDIT1: Obviously, I am not complaining at all. It saves a lot of time. But in about 20 interviews in my entire life for professional roles, I’ve never had just one round of interview, and never had HR sit in on the entire interview.\n\n",
