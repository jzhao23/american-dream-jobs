    "title": "Clinical Massage Therapy is Not Prostitution",
    "text": "Any exchange of money for the purposes of stimulating the genitals is considered prostitution in most countries, and is illegal in most places around the world. Should prostitution be legal? This is an excellent question for a different subreddit. Are there businesses that do this covertly anyway? Yes. Are many of these businesses exploitative? Yes. Do they sometimes traffic their workers? Yes. Do massage therapists sometimes engage in this kind of work independently? Yes. Do these businesses also sometimes get shut down by local governments, with financial and legal repercussions for clients and staff? Also yes. Do people in the healing professions sometimes cause great harm? Unfortunately, yes.\n\nA practicing massage therapist has a license and a business reputation to defend. A massage therapist should have received training in ethics, and understands the harm that can come from sexual contact of any kind with a client. \n\nWhen you ask, \"How do I ask for a happy ending?\" what you are really asking is, \"How can I find a licensed clinician who has compromised their ethics and is willing to risk licensure for extra money, and contribute to the degradation of the profession?\" In essence, you are asking, \"How can I find a bad actor in an industry already rife with bad actors?\"\n\nWe are not going to help you with that here.\n\n",

    "text": "Let’s say you’re doing a couples massage.\n\nYour coworkers client says ten minutes in that it hurts.\n\nYour coworker asks is it too much pressure?\n\nThe client says no it’s that the digging into my bone hurts. I like a lot of pressure just not into my bone hurts\n\nYour coworker then says, I have 16 years experience, I think I know what I’m doing. We not push on bone. This very tight. Bones cracking. Is not a lot pressure.\n\nThe client quietly says oh ok.\n\nA few minutes later your coworker asks about the pressure. The client says, well again it’s not the pressure it’s the bone. I have lots of deep tissue massages but not where they dig into bone.\n\nCoworker says, well this is good we do less a pressure.\n\nThe client says no, the pressure is fine it’s just the spot you’re working on. If we could work further over here.\n\nThe client then points (coworker removes hands) to her left scapula with her left hand. She has excellent ROM, her fascia isn’t visibly glued at all, her scap lifts several inches. It is easily visible from afar. And it is easy to see her point at her rhomboids.\n\nCoworker then says, we can work on something not back.\n\nClient says, well, I’d like to work on the back it’s just hurting the way you’re digging.\n\nCoworker then puts her hands back on the client, and continues to use sharp tools with a lot of pressure on her supraspinatus and infraspinatus. As she restarts she says, this is good, you bones cracking, cracking, you feel it’s not too much pressure, it’s good, okay?\n\nThe client then stops points and says, ok.\n\nCoworker continues. Client pops up and says you know what, that actually really is hurting. I’d like you to please not work on bone. Her face is red, and puffy, and wet.\n\nCoworker steps back and says, well I don’t know what fuck you want me to do because this how I been training and I have been massage therapist sixteen years, so I don’t know what you want.\n\n___________\n___________\n\nWhat would have you done? What would you do now?\n\n___________\n___________\n\nI said, Cowoker, she wants you to focus on bigger muscles, not the small ones like n her scap because it’s hurting. Coworker looked irate that I had said anything. I considered suggesting we switch but it seemed like that would escalate anger.\n\nCowoker then moved to continue, but client lifted up and said, you know what actually I think I’m done, yeah, I want to end this, I, I, don’t want to keep going. Can we stop please.\n\nAt this point my direct quotes get muddled because my anxiety got so high that it became blurry.\n\nCowoker started to say something along the lines of encouraging client to continue.\n\nI said, Cowoker, we’re leaving!\n\nAnd glared to make her leave.\n\nIn the hallway she began complaining to me that her client was being crazy, she knows what she’s doing, sixteen years, etc etc same as before.\n\nThen she, ugh omg, I don’t even know you what she could possibly have been thinking, she decides to go back in???? Even though we know she is getting redressed!?!?!? She opens the door, reveals her client fully to us both, makes some flabbergasted noise, then backs back out.\n\nI tell her to go talk to management about what’s happening. I will walk client back.\n\nShe leaves. I walk client back. Client is crying. I comfort her. I validate her emotions. I tell her it’s ok to have an emotional reaction to what just happened and to process as she needs to. Apologies for the actions of my colleague. Tell her to drink water, rest, use the steam room and sauna, a manager will come talk to you soon. She’s no longer crying.\n\nMy Cowoker comes back around the corner. Berates client again about 16 years, been working here for nine years, never had someone get up, complain, etc, you don’t know what you didn’t realize, I was helping you, etc etc.  I honestly couldn’t even process her words at this point because I was just so upset and angry and confused and disgusted and shocked and just so many things. I stood behind my coworker as she talked at client. Client and I watched each others faces get more and more dejected.\n\nCoworker leaves. Client begins crying again.\n\nI validate again. Commend her for self advocating. I apologize on behalf of coworker again. Calm her down. Tell her management will come soon.\n\nI go back to clients husband. And tell him what’s happening. Ask if he wants to continue. He says no. I walk him out.\n\nI go up front.\n\nCoworker is talking to boss.\n\nThen I talk to boss. Tell her all this.\n\nBoss then talks to clients.\n\nBoss then tells me I was wrong to validate the client. That I shouldn’t have said anything at all. That she was my coworkers client. Not mine. That the conversation I had with client was Boss’s job. Not mine. I escalated the situation and threw my colleague under the bus.\n\nBoss says she dealt with it. I’m gonna do a 30 minute for her. Husband is just gonna wait. \n\nBefore I go in, Boss says, don’t say anything about the previous session. Just act like it didn’t happen. This is a new session. Don’t throw your coworker under the bus.\n\nI say, it feels like you think I threw my coworker under the bus.\n\nShe says, well you told client that she was valid to be upset.\n\nUh huh\n\nThat’s not your job.\n\nHow is that not my job?\n\nIt’s my job. And you escalated it by telling her how she feels is ok and it’s ok for her to feel this way and now she’s a blubbering mess because you said it was ok instead of letting me handle it. I’ve been in this industry twenty years, ok, I know how to handle these things and I clocked her from the beginning, even before she got here just when she was making the appointment, I could tell she was gonna be a problem. Ok? You don’t cry this much unless there’s something wrong with your head ok. She’s reacting way too much. This is unhinged. There’s something not right in her brain. Ok. But I calmed her down and you’re gonna go do her massage and not talk about the session that just happened? Ok just focus on moving forward.\n\nSo you don’t want me to validate someone’s emotional experience?\n\nNo, it just makes everything more dramatic. Ok. I know how to handle these things. Just let me take care of this. Also you should’ve offered to switch. You could have deescalated during the session and switched.\n\nShe then left.\n\nI went and did the 30 minutes.\n\nI didn’t bring up the last session but she did. I ignored Boss and did what I believe is right (please let me know if you agree or disagree with my choices). Client said she had never experienced anything like that before. I told her I was very sorry she experienced that. She said she’s had lots of deep tissue massages before but had never had someone dig into her bone like that.\n\nI checked in on pressure and location and technique way more than I normally would have for a 30 minute. She responded positively and asked for more pressure at one point as I began getting my forearm into her rhomboids and then asked for more when we flipped for the pecs.\n\nShe and her husband tipped me $100.\n\nI was blocked off the schedule the following day. Coworker had a full book.\n\n\n\n\n\n__________\n__________\n\nTLDR: coworker continued to massage someone after client said stop.",

    "title": "Refusing Service",
    "text": "This is going to be a long post. \n\nI ended a session yesterday. I've been a therapist for close to 5 years, and I've only refused service one other time (because the client came in drunk). This time the client was sober, but he was incredibly rude. He was clearly not happy with my massage, and so I decided to end the session. \n\nThe vibes were off when I got him from the waiting room. I introduced myself and said, “It's nice to meet you,” and he just stared at me. During the intake I repeated his focus areas back to him to confirm what he wanted, and he looked at me funny. I brushed it off. I got the impression he wasn't a nice person, but I've had plenty of different personalities on my table. I still intended to try my best to give him a good massage. \n\nShortly after I started, I checked in about the pressure. He said he needed more. I ended up giving him the max amount of pressure I could offer, and he told me to use tools if I needed to. I think that may have been his way of saying that the pressure wasn't enough. At the location I was working at, we are not allowed to use tools. I apologized for the situation and told him I could not use tools. For some context, I can offer pretty deep pressure. I've had several clients tell me I've given them the deepest massage they have ever received. I know all bodies are different, and I'm sure there are therapists that can offer even deeper work, though. \n\nWe were about 20 minutes into the massage, and I had just finished his left shoulder. I went to switch to the other side, and he said, “You missed a lot of trigger points on that side.” \n\nI offered to work more on his left shoulder, and he agreed. I tried to talk through the process, asking if I was in the right spot. I at one point asked if the service wasn't working out for him, and he said, “Well, I hope it works out because I've been looking forward to this.” He pointed to a spot on his shoulder, and when I started working on it, he said, “You're not on it. Just switch to the other side.” \n\nAt this point I felt it wasn't a good fit. I also did not appreciate the tone he was speaking in. I decided to end the session. I said, “I feel that this isn't a good fit. I am going to go ahead and end the session, that way we won't have to charge you.” \n\nHe was pretty angry when I told him I wouldn't be continuing and told me he did not want to end the session. He tried to insist that we continue. I said, “I'm feeling uncomfortable, and I don't feel comfortable continuing.”\n\nHe replied with a snarky, “You're uncomfortable?” Then he told me I was being very unprofessional. \n\nI left the room, and went and told the front desk the situation. I then reported what happened to management. The manager told me I did the right thing. \n\nI know he's going to call and complain. I'm sure he'll write a nasty review and drop my name in retaliation. I think it's very possible he would have complained regardless of whether or not I continued the massage. \n\nI'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little upset, but I am mostly proud of myself for standing up to him. I was in a similar situation about three years ago with a female client. She kept criticizing my technique and telling me I didn't know how to do my job. I remember really wanting to make her happy. I gave her the option to end the session, instead of just ending it, and she kept saying she wanted to continue. Then towards the end of the session she said, “I'm done,” and they ended up comping her. I knew I needed to be the one to end the session this time, and to not let a client use and abuse me. \n\nTo any therapists out there who have encountered clients like this, please remember that you have the right to refuse service. We are people too, and we don't deserve to be talked down to. \n",

    "title": "Why I Touch the Way I Do (and Why I Stayed Up Reading as a Kid)",
    "text": "\nThis is a post for fellow LMTs, especially those who find themselves drawn to the deeper layers of our work—nervous system attunement, trauma awareness, mind-body integration. I’ve been practicing for a while now in Washington State, and I wanted to share a little of how I got here—not as a pitch, but as a kind of anchoring. For anyone else walking a similar path.\n\nAs a kid, I didn’t sleep. I stayed up reading—hundreds of books a year. Not because I wanted to be brilliant. I was just trying to stay safe. If I stayed up reading, my brother couldn’t attack me. Silence was dangerous. Sleep was a gamble. So I read. And in the dark, I learned to listen.\n\nThat kind of listening—the survival-based, hyperattuned kind—became the backbone of how I read people now. Not intellectually, but somatically. Nervous system to nervous system. The kind of presence that tracks breath, micro-movement, shifts in tone, fascia that says “not yet.” You know what I mean.\n\nI became a massage therapist because, in some way, touch was the thing that helped me return to my body after all of that. And now, it’s what I offer others. Especially the people who’ve been through complex trauma or long-term pain. The ones whose systems never really learned how to feel safe inside their own skin. The ones who need touch that listens.\n\nI work mostly solo now. Trauma-aware. Somatic-focused. WA state licensed. Slowly building a network of clinicians who speak the same language—or want to. If any of this resonates, feel free to message me. And if not, thanks for reading anyway. I know how many of us got into this work for reasons we don’t always put on our intake forms.\n\nIn solidarity,\nSteven – Diadrom Massage Therapy\n(WA State LMT – 61221351)",

    "text": "So I just moved up to the next level where we start taking real clients. I wasn’t expecting to be given someone the minute I walked into class today, seeing as I hadn’t even been given a basic lay of the clinic land yet. \n\nI read the client’s name aloud, and judging by the reactions of the class, it was clear I was being initiated or hazed. Apparently, this lady comes in every week and is notoriously difficult, unsatisfied, and full of complaints and harsh feedback. She straight up told one girl that she is not good lol. They were bracing me for what to expect and how to deal with her, etc.\n\nSo I’m like pacing around, dreading her arrival for a whole hour. When she arrived, my hands were sweating as I went to go fetch her. I introduced myself and immediately gave the disclaimer that she was my first client ever, in hopes that she would go easy on me. She said “oh great”, and sighed and rolled her eyes.. \n\nAs she hobbled grumpily down the hallway, she was very firm and direct about what she needed/expected, and her frustration with previous visits. She said that girls just don’t have the strength to go as deep as she needs. She also said how she hated that we sometimes take too long to enter the room once she’s on the table, cutting into her time (hey, that’s a fair complaint). So, I waited by the door so that I could at least start things off on the right foot. \n\nI go in and *immediately* make a mistake by applying a bunch of oil to my hands before remembering to do the over-sheet compressions. I quickly wiped it off and started compressions, realizing that my mind is now blank and I don’t remember anything about anything. \n\nI go to the head of the table to start I don’t even know what. I put my hands on her and it all just flowed from there. I stayed in communication to make sure she was satisfied throughout. She kept expressing relief and gratitude, and we had legit great conversation throughout. She even asked me to go lighter at one point, which my classmates said was not possible.\n\nIt ended with her telling me multiple times how amazing it was and that she couldn’t believe it was my first day. I went back to class and they were eager to hear how it went. I had to disappoint them all by telling them how great it went! I’m still riding the high from that this morning. Feeling very encouraged and on the right path. Thanks for reading 🙏🏻",

She’s been coming to this student clinic for over 10 years. It’s been a few months since she has been there. Her son brought her, and she could barely walk. I met her at the door. I had to help her undress-We just went down to undershirt and pants. I helped her on the table, helped to get her comfortable. She did not stop thanking me, telling me what a good job I was doing,  and how wonderful it felt the entire time. It hit me hard that we are serving human beings. They aren’t just clients or patients or whatever we choose to call them. They are human beings and we are capable of bringing them so much relaxation and pain relief. Really- if you’re feeling down or wondering why you’re getting into this profession just remember The people that we impact. As she left she told me that I made her week. And then she stopped and smiled and said, “no honey, you made my month!” I am just plain humbled.",

    "text": "This is an update to the post I made a week ago about my job at Massage Envy. If you did not see it, feel free to look at my post history.\n\nAfter telling my manager I would not do the trainings with my colleagues to learn to “own to room” and “assist with verbiage”, I got a phone call from her boss. I let her go to vm, she texted me that she needed to talk to me before my next shift. I responded that she could send me any necessary communication via text or email and I’d get back to her when I was available. (I had just told my manager to stop texting and calling me outside of work lol so I decided I’d die on that hill. They want to fire me, they can put it in writing. Also I will not allow you to waste any more of my time when I am not being compensated).\n\nWell, a few days passed without her saying anything. Eventually, I get an email from her where she also CC’d my manager. In the email, she said that if I didn’t complete those required trainings, they would accept that as my resignation.\n\nI already planned on quitting but man was I not expecting this flip from them! Being punished into mandatory trainings, losing my job - all because they didn’t want to do anything about the sexual misconduct clients!\n\nI responded to the email by restating all that had happened, and how wrong it was that not only would they not ban clients, but I was losing my job over this. I stated I’ve been a great employee, even winning highest enhancement rate attachment the week before. I let them know that I would be reporting them to the state board. I resigned. \n\nI just saw another post from someone sharing their similar situation at Massage Envy. We HAVE to speak up everyone. Massage Envy truly is a stain on our field. The more we speak up, the more of us that say NO to this, the better chance that something will be done. Start telling your coworkers, your former massage school classmates, LMT friends, and report it to the board. Call the police when appropriate. ",

    "text": "So  I had taken a client after lunch, and while in the massage room, my stomach started to hurt really badly. I thought I could power through this pain, but sadly, no. So as my client was lying prone while I was stretching her arm, I farted. It was silent but deadly. In this moment, I could have apologized or ignored it, but instead, I said, without missing a beat, \"It's okay, it's natural, it happens to all of us.\" So I then proceeded to gaslight this person into thinking they farted. So, I finished the message, and I thought, \"Well, this sucks. Hopefully, she believes it was her after all that.\"  NOPE at the front desk, she proceeded to say \" so glad I didn't fart that would have been embarrassing\" and then, like a fart, paid and left and never came back.  Why did I think this was a good idea IDK.  Anyway, if anyone that works with me is here yea its meee I hope this made someone's day, as I think that was the worst day of my life. \n\n\nFor those saying oh say I something and leave I work at a franchise and we are not allowed to leave the client once we start time. Sooooo yea also it was the last like 20 mins so I thought I was fine I went into a lunge and at that moment I knew I fucked up.  Take that with what you will. \n\nUpdate: listening writing this before I go back to the scene of the crime. For everyone who is like you suck fair, but also hear me out I’m pretty sure I’m a personality hire at this point. I’m not the massage therapist that talks softy and is all zened out I’m a chaos goblin and all my clients are the same or come back for the chaos idk.  With that being said me and the client before I dropped the silent nuke where joking about flame throwers and lighting up cactuses because they grow crazy out here and on their property after the fart and gas light attempt I stopped talking with them which is unusual as we normally have good repot with each other. Which is why I’m pretty sure at the front desk they said “I’m glad I didn’t fart that would have been embarrassing”.  The tip was a joke because I told one of my coworkers and they said well I guess it didn’t work they know it’s you.  Also yes sadly we can’t leave the room because the clinic said it’s a safety thing for the client so unless there is a medical emergency we are stuck once we start time. So we have to grab all the stuff before we all go in.  The lunch you may ask that started this the bubblebee canned tuna with that hard rock cookie and a Pepsi. ",

I have been treating this person for over a year and the relationship has slowly degraded. Initially, the patient loved the massage and said the treatments helped them walk again after years of pain, but for the last couple months the patient has booked appointments, come for their initial treatment with the acupuncturist and then said no massage. And the times they did do their massage, their attitude was bad, they only wanted me to touch their legs and would complain about the smallest things (the foot stool is too far away, the lotion is too greasy, etc) \n\nFinally, just now, they said no for the 3rd time despite being booked and they would see me next week. I said no, you won't, I unfortunately have to refuse your appointment. There was no yelling or arguing, just an acknowledgement of it. I kind of wish there was some yelling because it seems all the progress they made with my treatment meant nothing.\n\nThanks for reading, I just wanted to put this out somewhere.",

    "text": "I was genuinely starting to question if I should close my business or not because of how hard the job had become. My lower back, hips, neck, shoulders, wrists were always screaming at the end of the day; no matter how much I stretched, cupped, foam-rolled, etc. I was falling wayy behind on other business duties because I was so burnt out that everything seemed like a huge, daunting task I just couldn't be bothered with. I have 2 days off a week and those days would be spent sitting in front of the tv playing Stardew Valley for hours because I literally didn't want to DO anything....\n\nI finally started dragging myself back to the gym (going every other day) about 2 weeks ago, with my only goal being to just get to the gym and do something. My main focus has been restrengthening my quads, core &amp; upper back, as those are my obvious weak areas. I haven't been doing anything crazy, just some resistance bands &amp; free weight excersises, and then I fast-walk at an incline on the treadmill for about 20 minutes.\n\nI can't even begin to tell you how amazing I feel now. Week 1 was awful- every gym day was just a reminder of how weak I was, I would fatigue super fast, had zero stability and was incredibly irritated with the muscle soreness after the fact. But I kept up with it, and this past week I noticed I could get through all of my sets without stopping. Or the muscle soreness isn't as bad the next day like it was week 1. And I was just like \"oh holy shit this is actually getting easier!\" It's just been such a great feeling.\n\nAnd now when I massage, while it's obvious I still have a lot of work to do with rebuilding strength, it's much more noticeable how awkwardly I've been holding myself. I haven't been able to fully lunge in forever, and now that I (sort of) can again, it's like \"Jesus Christ, it could've been this easy all this time??\"\n\nI'm just proud of myself and thought I'd share :) If you're feeling stressed and/or burnt out all the time and you're not actively engaged in any kind of physical activities other than massage, chances are you're just weak in certain muscle groups!",

    "text": "I started a holistic massage therapy program in January and it’s been incredible so far. I’m learning so much about what it is to take care of other people and myself. Since starting school I’ve been practiced on by literal angels. Im talking about people who truly have a gift. I’ve also been told I have this “gift”. Based on the feedback I’ve been given from my practice sessions, clients have told me I have “magic hands” and “a nurturing touch” and “a safe, calming presence”. It always makes me feel so fulfilled to give people a good session and provide pure relaxation as well as making them feel safe. Since starting the program I’m realizing how I like to be touched and how I don’t like to be touched. School has also triggered some previous traumas that I’m slowly healing through. Lately I feel myself resenting the touch of my partner, (8 months together) and it’s not because I’m touched out. Both of our love languages is physical touch but we both have different definitions and mine has been expanding and changing since I started school. I’ve had to tell him many times to be more gentle and soft with me in general and I’ve told &amp; shown him, but it seems to go over his head and he does it until I eventually lose my temper which I feel guilty for. I didn’t realize how much touch matters before I started giving and receiving bodywork. Just wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience after starting massage school while being in a relationship? Maybe I’m posting in the wrong Reddit group but I figured it’s worth a shot to get some sort of clarity. \n\n\nEdit: after putting down boundaries &amp; not being received I made the decision to leave the relationship.

    "text": "i (23f) know this is a strong statement but after only 2 years of being in this field it rings very true to me. i came into this field eager to help , to learn the body, to help people along their own journeys. this industry took that and burned it to the ground.\n\nlet me give you some context. i loved school although i had some sketchy teachers that just couldnt help but make comments about my body (should have been warning signs to me) but overall it changed my life, it felt so natural to me and everything flowed while i was massaging. i passed my mblex on the first try, i retained a lot of info, and i was on my way to be a therapist i was proud of.\n\ndue to financial situations i needed to get a job and i needed one fast, thus i ended up in the arms of a massage envy. i knew the risks but i needed the money and steady cliental. I spent 9 months there (basically fast food but for massage)(also somehow expect you to start and stop a massage at the same time) and I hoped when i moved to another non chain massage company things would be different. But in fact, I made more money at massage envy than this newer place and with less flexible hours. \n\nI know its my fault for staying at these places for so long but I just want to warn future therapists that a lot of people are going to try to take advantage of you and pay you so so SO much less than you are worth. I think that massage is such a beautiful and lovely art and I hope me taking time away will bring that joy back to me. \n\nI think unless you are training like an athlete or working part time this career will fuck up your body. I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN. sheeesh does this career have you feeling pain you have never felt before. for future therapists you need to be weight training. I didn’t because i get nervous about it and i also was exhausted at, learn from my mistakes. But also realize how much time you have to dedicate to the gym if u chose this field. I also think that this career is only really worth it if you work for yourself or again, only working part time.\n\nI also did not realize how lonely this field can be, at lease for me. I had to open and close the studio by myself and did not really see any of my coworkers. Just me, a client, and spa music. It made me feel like a massage numb robot. \n\nI honestly would love to hear other peoples experiences, and please know i have so much respect for this field and the people, I just hate the greedy owners that use and abuse this healing art to make money - thats the main disappointment.",

    "text": "So this is definitely a first for me. I've been practicing for 11 years and I had a client come in today and it was her first time with me but it was also her last massage as she had canceled her membership and was using her final package. we spent the entire session talking about life and she really enjoyed her service and was even reconsidering canceling her membership. Like the last minute of the massage i'm wrapping up with her feet and she suddenly pulls her legs away and screams. I assume she got a sudden cramp or something but then she starts swatting at her shoulder. I said what is there a bug or something? And she gets up and says I'm done I'm done and I ask her if everything is OK and she said she felt something grab her shoulder. She starts rebuking whatever it is in the name of Jesus and saying a prayer and wouldn't let me leave the room until she was fully dressed because she was so freaked out. I told her I would sage the room and she said no no that won't do anything you need prayer which isn't really something I subscribe to. I didn't feel any sort of negative energy in the room so I feel like she brought in with her. I felt no cold spots or negative energy and neither did my coworkers. She said she had a bad feeling about this place. she was white as a sheet and she pretty much ran out the door after she checked out. I feel like there was a logical physical explanation to it but she was so sure that it was some sort of evil force. Definitely a very interesting experience.",

Lady, I didn't even watch the video. You want me to incorporate spiritual teachings I \"learned\" second hand from some random YouTuber into my massages? I told her that wouldn't do it. It would not be authentic or genuine. And it certainly would feel super weird. This is not one off, either.

He explains the technique. It sounds strange and unsafe. I said it doesn't sound like anything I do or would try. I asked what modality it was so I could direct him to a practitioner who works with that modality. His response? \"Oh, there's no modality. They weren't a massage therapist. They're just really into massage and they made it up. Ya know, you get enough massages, and you can do this kind of thing.\" OH. OKAY. Lol.

    "text": "I feel like I am in a toxic relationship with Massage Envy. \n\nI graduated last year and it was my first job out of school. I was doing it part time while I started my own business. To avoid identifying myself, I picked up a fungal infection while I worked there, as well as a respiratory infection that landed me in the ER. I left after talking to my manager about concerns about cleaning (no time between sessions = minimal cleaning and a cleaner that only came once a week). My concerns fell on deaf ears. \n\nMy business was working, but without going into too much detail to avoid identifying myself, I had to stop it because it wasn’t working with my current family situation. I decided to return to Massage Envy, because I wanted to keep building on my experience, have consistent pay, and I mostly liked my coworkers/manager/etc when I worked there. \n\nThis time around, it has been a whirlwind of issues. I recently had to ask for my hours to get lowered as well as make my lunch longer because I was physically burning out. The lack of time between appointments made it impossible to have any rest, drink water, go to the bathroom etc. and I would inevitably fall behind so my break would be cut short too. They reluctantly agreed (only said yes after I said I was going to do what I had to do when they said no). \n\nAfter they agreed to change my hours and lunch, I was proud of myself for sticking to my boundaries &amp; thought things could work.\n\nUntil yesterday, during which I had my second sexual incident with a client. Again, without going into too many details for my privacy, the two instances were of men that showed visible arousal and did other things such as noises/comments that were inappropriate. That’s as much as I’ll say. Well, during both situations I was dismissed because “nothing actually happened” according to my boss (coming down from corporate- she always says she has to talk to her boss and get back to me). \n\nWell yesterday, I was surprised to find out that she has scheduled me for three sessions with my colleagues so that they can train me on “owning the room” and “assist me with verbiage”. I have no issue owning the room. This is not something I’m doing wrong. So not only do these clients not get banned from returning, but now I get training (during which I’m only paid minimum wage as opposed to my usual pay) so my colleagues can teach me how to own the room and what to say to these men???? \n\nThere are a lot of other details I’m leaving out of things that have happened, boundaries I’ve had to set, but this is the big stuff. I am done. I feel like I’m having to compromise my morals to work here at this point and that will not work for me. I really tried to make it work, for the meantime until I can resume my business again. However, this is not worth it. I just wanted to write this out to empower anyone else who might be going through something similar. ",

What adds to the frustration is that the spa books services as “deep tissue” versus “Swedish,” when in reality every body is different.

This LMT owner is illegally 1099ing (the post literally says ‘will train’ which is a clear 1099 violation) and makes $75 on every contractors massage to their $55. It’s insane. It’s robbery. How does this therapist sleep at night knowing she’s doing this to her own kind?! Even for w2 positions that pay would be on the low side ethically. For 1099, it should be minimum 70%.\n\nIt’s so frustrating. Therapists trying to get started are given the option of terrible pay and w2 or bad pay and illegal 1099 work. Things need to change. I am a huge proponent for going solo or room renting, but it’s a hard venture to take on and not everyone is in a place to financially push through the start weeks of 1-2 clients/wk. There is value in having small business, legally structured, supporting the members of our community. Why do none of these therapist run places want to do that?\n\nETA: I tried to make a post to give business owners an opportunity to share their salaries since they claim they don’t make any money and the mods removed it lol no transparency because they know they’re screwing us over",

    "title": "From Hopeful to Disillusioned — A New LMT’s Wake-Up Call About the Industry",
    "text": "\nI recently became a licensed massage therapist—and I was genuinely excited. I chose this career with purpose, ready to support others through healing work and build something sustainable and meaningful for myself.\n\nBut what I’ve encountered since entering the job market has been… devastating.\n\nYes, there are plenty of jobs out there. But the vast majority? Exploitative, misclassified, or outright illegal.\n– IC roles that are really W-2 jobs in disguise.\n– W-2 roles that require unpaid “training,” unpaid pre-shift prep, unpaid post-session duties, and side work.\n– No guaranteed minimums. No contract. No clarity.\n– Pay that fluctuates or is docked without consent.\n– Managers acting like you owe them your body and free labor just to “earn your place.”\n\nWorse, my massage school—which holds a prestigious public reputation—offers zeropost-grad support. No job vetting. No career counseling. No guidance on navigating real-world exploitation. Just silence. And we barely touched on employment law or contract literacy. It’s like we were prepped for massage, but not the industry.\n\nI’m not saying there aren’t good places out there. But why is it so hard to find basic, legal, respectful work? Why is this level of dysfunction and devaluation normalized?\n\nI’m older. This is a second career. I don’t have the luxury of learning through burnout or injury. I had hoped to spend 2–3 years working in different environments before transitioning to private practice—but now, I feel like I have no choice. The current massage labor market offers no protections, little regulation, and an endless stream of “jobs” that expect free labor and silence.\n\nI’m hurting, disillusioned, and frankly depressed. If you’ve been through this or found a way to thrive without sacrificing your integrity and body—please share. I could reallyuse support from those who’ve been in the fire and found a way forward.\n\nNote: If you're here to tone-police, dismiss, minimize, or lecture—I ask that you please keep scrolling. This post is not for you. I'm already carrying a lot, and I’m speaking up because silence only protects the systems that harm us. I'm here to connect, not be corrected.\n\n✨ EDIT/UPDATE: Thank You — and a Note on Where This is Going\n\nFirst, thank you — truly — to everyone who took the time to comment, share resources, drop knowledge, and just be real. Your stories, your honesty, and your resilience are medicine.\n\nI posted this out of deep frustration and grief about how this industry, which is supposed to be about healing, can feel so disconnected from care — especially for the practitioners doing the work. I didn't expect this level of resonance.\n\nOver the past few months, I’ve had some challenging professional experiences that left me questioning whether I even belonged here. But the comments in this thread reminded me:\n\nI'm not alone in feeling disillusioned,\n\nThe system isn’t broken — it was built this way,\n\nAnd we don’t have to keep accepting it just because it’s “normal.”\n\nIt’s been comforting — and honestly motivating — to hear from LMTs who’ve gone private, stayed grounded in their values, and still built something sustainable. That’s what I’m working toward now.\n\nTo those who are still in the trenches — underpaid, undervalued, overbooked — I see you. Keep talking. Keep pushing back. Keep choosing dignity.\n\nWe may not be able to change the system overnight, but refusing to normalize exploitation is a darn good place to start.\n\nWith respect and solidarity.\n\n",

    "title": "The Culture of Tipping in Massage therapy",
    "text": "I don’t want to stir up controversy… well, maybe a little, but with respect.\nI’m from Mexico, and here the tipping culture is different from countries like the United States, although it’s slowly starting to resemble it.\n\nI’ve been reading some posts on this topic and found comments that honestly surprised me. Therapists saying that if someone couldn’t leave a tip, they shouldn’t come in for a massage, even if they were in pain. Others claimed they wouldn’t do a good job if they didn’t get a tip, or that tipping was practically mandatory.\nIn general, they agreed that “they don’t work for charity” and that “they have to bring money home,” which is totally valid—but they forgot that the service is already being paid for.\n\nI want to understand all possible perspectives before making a judgment. That’s why I’m sharing my experience.\n\nWhen I finished studying, I opened my own business. At first, I didn’t expect tips; in fact, when someone left me one, I felt uncomfortable. Later on, I left my private practice and started working at a spa. I loved the atmosphere and felt very happy, even though the salaries and commissions were low.\n\nThat’s where I connected with the world of tipping. Some people gave me a generous tip after the service, others didn’t, and yes, I felt a bit disappointed. Still, it never crossed my mind to complain to a client or hint that they should leave a tip.\n\nI always treated everyone well, with or without a tip. But I did notice that, unconsciously, I was even more helpful with those who did leave one. Not because I looked down on the others, but because I wanted to show appreciation and motivate them to return. Even so, the quality of my massage never changed: I always gave my best, because I understood that the client was already paying for an expensive service, and I had chosen to work under those conditions.\n\nWhat unsettles me is seeing colleagues justify poor service if they don’t get tipped, as if it were a client’s obligation and not a voluntary act. I don’t share that view, but I also don’t want to judge without understanding their reasons.\n\nMy intention isn’t to start pointless arguments, but to open an honest dialogue. I’m interested in knowing how this culture is experienced in other countries: how do you handle the topic of tipping? What are your thoughts on it? Do you feel comfortable with this dynamic? Whether you’re for it, against it, or have a different take, I’d like to hear your reasons. I want to better understand this topic that, without a doubt, is part of our work as therapists.\n\nSending greetings from Tijuana, Mexico.",

    "text": "I think that massage therapists, especially those who work for any employer, should help push for the evolution of this industry. Before corporations gain too much power over our labor. I am working on some things and I have plans. \n\nIn the meantime I think we should all collectively demand to stop doing any unpaid labor such as set up, clean up, intake, creating treatment/goal plans, etc that falls outside a reasonable and compensated time to do such tasks. If we are constantly shorted the time to do these tasks effectively, then the time should be extended AND paid. Care work and female dominated work has historically been taken advantage of, asked us to work out of love and care and other emotionally charged moral arguments versus treating our work as economic. Even to the point of asking us to do free work. \n\nI say, we take our power collectively and say NO. We are worth what EVERY other profession is worth in that they are paid for ALL work expected of them. \n\nI don’t care what the industry was like 20 years ago. It’s 2025, it’s a different economy, and we DESERVE it. Tell me what other job, minus salary, doesn’t pay you for set up, clean up, your professional expertise in intake and planning, etc? I was a line cook for years. I was a team lead at a call center. You bet every task I had to do- setting up prepping helping other team members cleaning advising etc was paid work. \n\nWe are trained professionals of whom some pay 1000s of dollars for their education. \n\nWe should be laughing in the face of these spas- which their CEOs could give a rats ass about our personal wellbeing. Their profit is not trickling down. ",

    "title": "Feel Like I've Been Duped Into This Career",
    "text": "I've been a massage therapist for ten years, worked in all sorts of settings from spa to clinical, and now for myself as a sole proprietary business. I am glad to have learned a lifelong skill, but it just isn't giving me the fulfillment and joy it used to like in the beginning. Primarily my issue with massage as I get older is that I am barely getting enough livable wages for all the physical labor I do. The nature for most of the jobs I was ever hired to do were often 1099 gigs or commission based pay starting at $15/hr which I find to be disrespectful to me as a practitioner. It not only takes on a physical toll, but a mental, and emotional one. Massage was definitely a calling for me. I knew I was good at it and always had a deep interest in the body/anatomy. I didn't have any other jobs besides massage that felt right. And now I am  32, struggling to get people into an office I rent per client, losing more money than I make. Not to mention my mental health issues and my decision to go back to school to study sonography. I just feel I have put so much effort and work into this career that it hasn't truly gotten me anywhere I want to be with it. I wanted to be taken seriously as a provider but that's likely not going to happen. I'm fed up. I'm really trying my best to not look back on my years as wasted but I can't help feel jaded. And looking for any other work is tough given all my past experiences are all massage related. Just thought I'd get this off of my chest because I keep asking myself what was all of this for? Hopefully someone understands my feelings. ",

When the partner comes in, it's pretty clear they are just there to check in and make sure you're legit and their spouse isn't seeing a prostitute. They're not at all engaged with the process, don't seem invested in getting the massage, but have all sorts of curiousity about your practice, your career, you personally, your office, etc. Then you never see them again but their partner continues as a regular client.\n\nI'm a male therapist so it usually happens with female clients' male partners. But sometimes male clients' male partners. And yeah, sometimes the wife legit just wanted her husband to do some self care and get a massage and he's doing it to placate her, but this is different.

I know there are a lot of considerations around that, but I'm hoping this community can help me figure out what I can add to my massage therapy practice that is lucrative without being physical once I'm licensed? In other words, what can I add that will allow me to work in this field full-time without burning out physically? I know I can't do massage 40 hours a week. I'm willing to invest in a little more training for something that will provide a good balance and that is in demand. I'm in the Denver – Boulder area if that matters.

    "title": "Starting Massage Therapy School While Overweight — Feeling Really Anxious About Body Image",
    "text": "Hi everyone,\nI’m 21F and starting massage therapy school this fall after graduating high school three years ago. I’m genuinely excited about this career — I’ve always been drawn to helping others and working in a hands-on, healing environment. But I’m also really anxious… mostly around body image.\n\nI’m very short and definitely overweight. I’ve been struggling with PCOS for years, which has made weight loss extremely difficult, and I also have some keloid scarring on my shoulders from hormonal acne. I’ve dealt with a lot of bullying in school about my body, especially in high school, and I still carry that trauma with me.\n\nI’ve heard that in massage therapy programs, you’re often expected to undress in front of your peers fairly early on in the training (for practice massages, etc.). The thought of being topless around others in a classroom setting is honestly terrifying to me. I’d rather walk barefoot on Legos than go through that — seriously. I’m scared people will look at me and silently judge me or think I’m gross because I’m not thin or “fit-looking.”\n\nSince it’s a health-based program, I’m worried everyone else is going to be in amazing shape, and that I’ll be the odd one out — like I don’t belong in that space. I want so badly to succeed in this program. I truly believe massage therapy aligns with what I want to do in life. But I don’t want my body — again — to be the thing that holds me back or makes me feel like I’m not enough.\n\nWere any of you in a similar situation starting out? Am I overthinking it, or are people really judgmental in these programs? Will I be the outsider again like I was in school?",

    "title": "Massage championships what have you heard or seen and what opinion do you have on them? Here’s my experience",
    "text": "This question comes as someone who just learned about massage championships this last year…Read an article in ABMP. And before that I guess I was aware they existed but dismissed them as something that was unprofessional silly and 100% not for me. I only do therapeutic clinical setting in my own office. \n\nThe reason I took a second look this year after reading the article is that I realized the opportunity for networking was huge. \n\nI’m a 29 year veteran of massage I have my own practice with therapists underneath me. I offer board approved CE classes and I want to switch my career from 80% of my work time doing table work 20% teaching to the opposite -80% teaching 20% table work. This just makes better business sense for me and leverages my time. \n\nI also have a product I’m trying to prototype that I use in my office with great results and I need more therapists to know about it. \n\nInitially I thought I’d attend a large one to meet therapists maybe have a vendor table? \n\nBut when I started researching I got in touch with one of the world champions who was willing to do a zoom call with me. I know she’s skilled. I know she’s professional. And I know competing has changed her trajectory in her craft so I was a little more open minded after zooming with her. \n\nI attended a championship. And after that I did a 180. I also want to tell you I only do clinical. \n\nI’m holding a shoulder course this month in fact for therapists who want to learn how to effectively treat and rehab shoulders the most complicated joint. \n\nI don’t have a “routine” I’m not into any sort of showmanship. \n\nBut one championship and I “got it”. It was not about competing! It was about learning from each other…getting better…it was about networking and inspiring and I ended up competing at the last minute and winning silver overall. With no “comp” experience or coaching. \n\nI hear a lot of people say: it’s unprofessional and that this type of competition is not good for our industry but after I came back from the competition with my medal one of my wealthier clients saw it and asked me how much I had spent to go there. I told him how much it cost me with airfare car hotel and registration and he offered to “sponsor” me for two more competitions. \n\nThis client has told me I have changed his life multiple times…Allowed him to maintain his daily golf game into his 70s. He’s always been verbally appreciative but to give me multiple thousands of dollars to continue to compete solidified what I was already thinking…our clients also like that we compete. And winning is not so hard actually. And there’s coaching available for it. \n\nThere’s also now a clinical category if youre like me and you only do therapeutic treatments. \n\nAnd I also didn’t realize that the USA is really far behind other countries in Europe and Asia that have been holding these for years. It’s newer in USA and new is strange in general. But I wouldn’t dismiss it if I were you. \n\nEspecially now when most people won’t compete you stand a good chance to be medaled and use that as marketing leverage. You may be the most amazing therapist in the world but if no one knows about you what good is that? \n\nI know therapists that have won medals and had some notoriety because of it and they have a 3 month waiting list and you’re probably just as good as them but to your potential clients the medals prove it. \n\nAnd in this economy maybe a little help in marketing and networking wouldn’t be such a bad idea…\n\nAnyways, that’s my take. I appreciate the help I got so I could take a second look at them from a different angle and I just wanted you to know I was where you are so I get why it seems unprofessional. Happy to answer any questions or provide help like I got to get a more fuller picture of what they are. If anyone’s interested. You can also dm me. \n\nEdit: I just want to add one more thought I forgot to mention. I like to travel but I can’t afford to do it as much as I want to. But traveling to go to competitions as a competitor judge or instructor would allow me to see parts of the world I’d have to pay to see out of my pocket when this way I can make it a true business expense. That was a 💡 moment. ",

    "text": "I have seen this question before asked, but the answers are always like “this is how you can continue to make massage work.” \n\nSo I am done with massage. Have been doing it for 8 years. Have worked in numerous settings, including having my own business. I’m done. 100%. Commission based pay and being a single mom don’t work. My body is also burnt out. I love massage and it’s time for me to be done. Completely. \n\nSo what NON-massage jobs or careers have you switched to once you’ve reached this point? \n\nI don’t want to do childcare or nursing homes, that’s what I was doing before. I don’t want to do retail or fast food. \n\nI have a cab job now and am working on slowly closing my business. I just have regulars that I love dearly and that’s the only reason why I haven’t just closed shop entirely. The cab job is surprisingly fun, but it’s also commission pay and it’s not something I want to do forever. \n\nI’m burnt out from being a caregiver, but I would be open to something like vet tech or phlebotomy. Also office jobs. Maybe I need to just not have to think and problem solve very much for a while. \n\nI want a job that would pay between $45k-$50k after taxes and is M-F. Is that even a good salary anymore? I live in upstate NY and the cost of living here has risen astronomically, but I’ve never even made beyond $28k/year so I’m not sure what would help. Anything above $40k sounds like a dream. \n\nI’m 32 and do have fibromyalgia, while I’m figuring things out I intend to focus on healing my body from burn out and begin strength training. But even then I don’t think a physically demanding job is what I want to do. \n\nThe aspects I love about massage is the connection and the ability to help someone deeply rest and feel their tension finally release. In my burnout I do struggle with that now, but it’s what comes to mind when I think of what I love about it. I think massage is a beautiful skill and needed, I often want to find ways to break barriers so impoverished and low income folks can have even weekly access to massage. I have a few clients who can afford weekly massages and all of them share the same sentiment, they NEED their weekly massage to get through the work week. Massage absolutely changed my life, as someone who comes from an incredibly poor background where no one gets them because they can’t afford them. Is there a career in advocating for massage access?? \n\nI have a bachelors degree that is halfway complete in psychology, I’m in the process of returning to school to finish it but I’m not sure if I even want to be a therapist in that capacity. \n\nWhen I was in elementary school and all the way to my senior year, I wanted to be a writer and illustrator, I wanted to write and illustrate children’s books. But I let a bunch of adults talk me out of it and now as a single mom I never have time to make art, and I’m crushed that my art skills have not developed or grown and have even gotten worse compared to what I was doing in high school. I think it’s too late for me in that regard. \n\nAny ideas I would appreciate. And if you left massage entirely and never went back and love your new career please tell me your process! I do not want advice on how to try to make massage work for me. I have accepted it’s time to be done with it. So please don’t try to tell me to try a different modality or different setting. I’ve already done that. ",
