    "text": "After 5 years in insurance sales I finally hit the mythical 100k(P&amp;C and Life) in new business premium in a month. I've hit 90 three times, but never crossed the 100 mark until last month.\n\nEvery January I make goals for the year, this year it was to bring in 1M in premium by myself. After a slow January and February I was really behind but last month I talked the agency owner to increase lead volume and we had our best month in agency history. \n\nInsurance is hard, sales is hard. Most of the people I've worked with since 2020 are no longer in the industry. I say all of that to say, if you put in the work and learn how to talk with people instead of at them you can be successful. I'm not a genius, I don't know any secrets, I just talk to people like they are a friend and over explain my policies. I write good policies and will fight for my customers. I truly go into work each day loving my job. \n\n",

    "title": "Getting Sued For $25,000 With 1 Just Phone Call",
    "text": "OK. I have an agent who’s been with me for about 1.5–2 years. Good guy. He recently bought *pre-sold leads* from an offshore telemarketing center. “Pre-sold leads” are supposed to be people who had already agreed to buy a policy, had a budget in mind, and were pre-qualified for health. In theory, the agent just had to “close the deal.”\n\nIt sounded too good to be true—and it was.\n\nOne of the WORST things you can do in this business is buy leads generated outside the U.S. These leads are often sourced in ways that are non-compliant with federal and state TCPA regulations, and the sellers can’t be held accountable due to being out of US jurisdiction.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened here. The agent took a call from one of these \"pre-sold\" leads as a live transfer, went through his normal pitch, and unknowingly gave his info to a professional litigant (somebody who sues companies for alleged TCPA violations on a regular basis). \n\nHere’s what the professional litigator did: he went after the *insurance carrier, not the agent*, for the TCPA claim. \n\nHe’s alleging a $10,000 TCPA violation for the state he’s in, plus $1,500 for several calls made to him from the company. The litigant wants a $25,000 settlement to make this problem go away.\n\nYou may think that the agent is safe. But he isn’t. If the carrier settles, they’ll pass the final settlement cost plus attorney fees to the agent to pay, even though the agent didn’t knowingly violate the Do Not Call list when he spoke to the litigant.\n\nThis isn’t a one-off case either, and cases like these are very common, especially for agents and agencies using crappy leads and questionable lead generation practices.\n\nPro-Tip: If you're purchasing your own leads, I highly recommend two things:\n\n1. **Buy litigator scrub lists** – This list is generated from TCPA lawsuits, and filter out known professional plaintiffs. This is the best way to eliminate the biggest risks of getting sued.\n2. **Phone number change scrub** – Very important here. This helps eliminate leads who have phone number changes after the lead is generated. You are not in compliance when calling a phone number owned by someone other than the person who filled out the lead.\n3. **Don’t buy from overseas vendors** \\- If you’re going to buy leads, make sure your vendor is US-based. Better yet, stick with leads that have a track record of express written consent.   \n\nBottom line: Be very careful where you get your leads. One bad call can cost you big.\n\n",

Listen guys, YouTube exists, this stuff isn’t hard. \n\nFacebook and Google have dumbed setting things up so much it’s ridiculous. You want to know how to create your own leads? \n\nOn Facebook you can find a built in tool called Facebook ads library. Type in the insurance product you sell and filter the results to show active ads that have been running 6month-1year. The older the ad the more successful. If the ad wasn’t making money, they would have killed the ad. Copy/model that ad. \n\nFor Google, pick a big city, Google &lt;what you sell&gt; &lt;big city&gt; whoever shows up at the top probably has a good ad. Look at their ad copy then look at the landing page they use. Copy/model them. \n\nIt’s simple, YouTube to figure out the setup, research what ads work, copy them….

    "title": "Client asked me to commit fraud.",
    "text": "I’m a recently licensed P&amp;C agent, growing my book of business through my existing network in hospitality. A referral came to me yesterday (3/14) needing insurance for his Hampton Inn &amp; Suites property (1 of 10 in his portfolio), existing policy expiring 3/22. He had a letter in hand from his lender saying he would be fined $2500 and be required to pay for insurance that they would purchase on his behalf, obviously he was trying to avoid this. He complained to me that his current agent would not return his calls and ignoring him. I’m thinking to myself, why would an agent ignore a client that’s worth a $million in premiums across his portfolio of hotels?\n\nWell the answer soon became clear. Hilton requires their franchises to carry a $10,000,000 umbrella. This guy asked me to only get him $1,000,000 in coverage but issue him a COI that states he’s covered for $10,000,000. He said his current agent would do that for him all the time. Sometimes the agent would issue the COI and then bind the policies a week or 2 later. I basically told the “client” that 1. He gave me 5 business days notice to find him coverage, and even if I did an AOR/BOR, there is no guarantee that the carriers would respond in that short of time frame. 2. I can only give him a COI with the actual coverages that he has in place.\n\nHe said that wouldn’t work, and he needs a COI now to appease his lender, and asked me again if I would send him one. That’s when I basically told the guy to go kick rocks. I’m going to assume that his previous agent is ignoring him because he’s fed up of the guy asking him to commit fraud. Unfortunately people like this exist.",

    "title": "The Realities of Life Insurance Sales: What It Takes to Succeed",
    "text": "Life insurance sales is often portrayed as a lucrative and flexible career, but the truth is, most agents don’t make it past the first few years. In my experience, more than 90% of life insurance agents fail within their first twelve months. Why? It’s not because the job is impossible, but because many agents enter the industry with misconceptions about what it really takes to succeed.\n\nIf you’re considering a career in life insurance sales, or you’re struggling to find your footing, please continue reading. I’m going to attempt to break down the key factors that separate successful agents from those who don’t make it.\n\n# The Harsh Reality: Most Agents Won’t Make It\n\nUnfortunately, the vast majority of life insurance agents quit within their first few years. The reason? Many new agents underestimate the amount of effort and skill required to build a sustainable business. Consider the following:\n\n* **Life Insurance Is NOT a Traditional 9-to-5 Job** – Unlike a regular salaried job, success in life insurance sales depends entirely on your ability to generate leads, build relationships, and close deals, day-in, and day-out. And rarely do life insurance employers offer guaranteed paychecks, so you eat what you kill as they say =).\n* **High Rejection Rate** – Selling life insurance means dealing with a lot of rejection. Not everyone wants to talk about life insurance, and even fewer are ready to buy. So get used to hearing “No” WAYYY more than you hear “Yes”.\n* **Learning Curve** – It takes time to develop the skills needed to succeed. Not only must you learn how to sell, you must learn how to navigate the application process for each carrier, manage the retention process, and more. Many agents give up before they ever get the chance to refine their sales techniques.\n\n# The Success Formula: What Agents Who Refuse To Fail Do Differently\n\nWhile the majority of agents struggle, there is a group of top performers who thrive in this industry. What do they do differently? \n\nIt comes down to *mindset, strategy, and persistence.*\n\n# 1. They Treat Selling Life Insurance Like a Business, Not a Job\n\nSuccessful agents understand that life insurance sales is not a regular job where you clock in and out. It’s a business, and they treat it as such. This means:\n\n* **Investing in marketing** to generate leads if they are not in a free lead program.\n* **Managing their time effectively** to maximize productivity. Idle hands are the Devil’s playthings in this business =).\n* **Tracking their progress** and constantly improving their sales process. PRO-TIP: The best agents listen to their own sales calls religiously. Nothing is better in improving your game.\n\n# 2. They Master the Art of Prospecting\n\nOne of the biggest reasons agents fail is because they run out of people to sell to. The best agents are constantly prospecting and generating leads. They do this by:\n\n* **Leveraging social media** to build an audience and attract potential clients, whether through organic posts or paid ads.\n* **Networking consistently** and forming connections in their community\n* **Asking for referrals** from satisfied clients\n\n# 3. They Have a Thick Skin and Embrace Rejection\n\nRejection is part of the game. The agents who succeed understand that “no” is not personal. They use rejection as a learning experience and keep moving forward. ALWAYS REMEMBER: The most successful life insurance agents hear NO more than than failed agents ever did.\n\n# 4. They Stay Consistent and Play the Long Game\n\nSuccess in life insurance sales doesn’t happen overnight. It takes months, sometimes years, to build a steady stream of clients and referrals. The top agents don’t give up when things get tough – they push through and remain consistent.\n\n# 5. They Find a Mentor and Join the Right Team\n\nNo one succeeds in this industry alone. The best agents seek out mentorship and surround themselves with people who can help them grow. Joining an agency with strong training, leadership, and support can make all the difference.\n\n# Is Life Insurance Sales Right for You?\n\nNot everyone is cut out for this industry, but if you’re willing to **put in the work, develop the right skills, and stay persistent**, you can build a highly successful and rewarding career. \n\nThe question is: Are you ready to do what it takes?",

    "title": "8 Tips for New Agents to Sell Insurance Successfully",
    "text": "Below I’ve compiled a list of 8 strategies imperative for new agents to execute on, if you want to see success selling insurance, regardless of the agency, niche, or product you sell.\n\nHere they are:\n\n# 1. Clear the Calculator\n\nSelling insurance is largely a mental game. In other words, you have to keep your emotions and focus in check at all times. This means you must not allow distractions from your personal life or sales calls gone sideways to affect your mindset. \n\nHere’s some tips that have helped me stay mentally sharp:\n\n* Treat every sales call as a fresh start. Getting rejected on one sales call doesn’t mean you’ll get rejected on the next. \n* It’s helpful to think of your clients rejecting **your offer**, not you. The rejection is business, not personal.\n* Maintain balance in your personal life—exercise, eat well, and manage relationships. Mental clarity fuels sales success.\n\n# 2. Eliminate Distractions\n\nSelling insurance is great, but especially those who sell remotely, it comes with endless distractions. To stay focused:\n\n* Set clear boundaries with family—work time is **work time**. Make sure your spouse and kids respect this.\n* Keep your phone muted and out of reach during work hours. Group your texts and calls to a scheduled time. Most of them can wait.\n* Social media and internet use while you should be selling kills productivity. Consider a low-cost app like [Freedom.to](http://Freedom.to) limit internet access while you should be working.\n\n# 3. Prioritize Activity Over Everything\n\nActivity leads to “app-tivity.” In other words, tracking your numbers is critical to uncovering opportunities to improve your results. Try tracking these metrics daily:\n\n* **Connection Rate** – How many people are you actually getting to pick up the phone? If this number is low, explore dialing technology that helps keep your number off the spam- and telemarketer-likely lists. I like Convoso and Kixie.\n* **Quality connections** – How many conversations last longer than two minutes? If you’re having trouble keeping your prospects on the phone, work on your opening script by practicing objection rebuttals until you can say them on the fly without hesitation.\n* **Closing rate** – How many policies are you selling compared to presentations?\n\nIf these numbers are low, adjust your strategy. Retrain your scripting. Success is a numbers AND a skill development game.\n\n# 4. Master Your Scripts and Rebuttals\n\nThe best agents **sound natural** but follow a proven process. If you don’t have a script, you’re winging it! And winging it doesn’t work long-term. A good script consists of the following:\n\n* A strong intro that overcomes initial objections while simultaneously helping the client remember that they in fact requested the information you’re calling about.\n* A handful of effective fact-finding questions that help build value and urgency to buy what you’re selling.\n* A good list of underwriting questions that help you figure out which product works best. I like using Insurance Tool Kits for life and final expense policy sales.\n* How to close confidently.\n\n# 5. Stay Consistent with Your Schedule\n\nConsistency wins. The more you treat your profession like a job, the better off you’ll be. I recommend the following:\n\n* Set a fixed start and end time every day. Stay disciplined to this as much as possible.\n* Avoid checking email or social media during work hours. Schedule a time before and after work for this.\n* Batch tasks. Separate prospecting, calling, and follow-ups.\n\n# 6. Improve After Every Call\n\nAfter a completed sales presentation - whether you sell or not - don’t just move on! Analyze what worked and what didn’t. Ask yourself the following:\n\n* Did I control the conversation? Or did the prospect control the pace? Remember that the person asking questions is in control.\n* Did I handle objections smoothly? If you’re stumbling in your script, practice it multiple times until it’s smooth.\n* What could I do better next time? Biggest pro-tip I can offer is to record your sales calls and listen to them. You’ll hear all sorts of opportunities to improve =).\n\n# 7. Develop Thick Skin\n\nRejection is part of the game. If you get rattled after a bad call, you’re losing twice. Keep moving. Instead, think about the following:\n\n* If someone hangs up? Act fast and dial the next lead instead of ruminating. Don’t spiral out of control!\n* If a prospect is rude? Probably like that with everyone. Don’t take it personal. Next!\n* If you get 50 rejections in a row? Think: a sale is that much closer =).\n\n# 8. Work Smarter, Not Harder\n\nSuccessful agents **leverage** tools and systems to increase efficiency:\n\n* Use a CRM to track leads and follow-ups. AgentCRM is a pretty good CRM to start if your agency doesn’t provide it.\n* Automate tasks where possible such as a chat bot to speak with your leads. Or use a compliant powerdialer to speak with more prospects faster. Again, I like Kixie and Convoso.\n* Constantly refine your approach based on data.\n\nHope this helps =)",

    "title": "The Big Beautiful Bill Passed, here are the changes to ACA",
    "text": "Passed Senate and House. House made no amendments to any ACA provision, so it'll hit Trumps desk where he will sign it. Here's the deal:\n\n1. Expiration of Enhanced Premium Tax Credits:\n   * The bill does not extend the enhanced premium tax credits, set to expire at the end of 2025, which were enacted under the American Rescue Plan Act and extended by the Inflation Reduction Act. These credits reduced premiums by capping them at 8.5% of household income and expanded eligibility to those earning above 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL). The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that their expiration would lead to 4.2 million more uninsured people by 2034, with average premiums increasing by about 75% for many enrollees, particularly affecting low-income families, rural communities, and small business owners.\n2. Elimination of Silver Loading:\n   * The bill ends the practice of \"silver loading,\" where insurers raised premiums on silver-tier ACA plans to offset the cost of cost-sharing reductions (CSRs) after federal reimbursements stopped in 2017. This change would increase out-of-pocket premiums for roughly 10 million enrollees who do not receive CSRs, potentially making coverage unaffordable. Some may drop coverage (an estimated 1.2 million or more could become uninsured) or switch to less comprehensive plans, increasing underinsurance.\n3. Shortened Open Enrollment Period:\n   * The annual open enrollment period for ACA marketplaces, currently from November 1 to January 15, would be shortened to end on December 15, reducing the enrollment window by about a month. Approximately 40% of ACA enrollees (around 10 million people) select plans after December 15, often relying on automatic reenrollment. This change could prevent many from enrolling or renewing coverage, potentially increasing the uninsured rate.\n4. Elimination of Automatic Reenrollment:\n   * The bill eliminates automatic reenrollment for ACA policyholders, requiring annual re-verification of income, household size, immigration status, and other eligibility factors starting in 2028. Over 10 million people were automatically reenrolled in 2025, and this new requirement could create administrative burdens, leading to coverage losses if enrollees fail to submit updated information promptly. The CBO estimates this could contribute to 3.1 million more uninsured due to marketplace changes.\n5. End of Provisional Eligibility for Premium Tax Credits:\n   * Currently, enrollees experiencing life changes (e.g., job loss, marriage, or having a baby) are provisionally eligible for premium tax credits for up to 90 days while their eligibility is verified. The bill requires full documentation before subsidies are applied, which could delay or deny subsidies, forcing enrollees to pay unsubsidized premiums temporarily. This could be particularly challenging for new parents waiting for a newborn’s Social Security number, increasing out-of-pocket costs.\n6. Increased Paperwork and Verification Requirements:\n   * The bill introduces stricter eligibility verification, requiring annual updates to income, immigration status, and other data. This could disproportionately affect lawfully present immigrants (e.g., asylees, refugees), who may lose subsidies, leading to higher premiums. Analysts note that younger, healthier immigrants’ exit from the market could leave an older, sicker pool, further driving up premiums. The CBO estimates these changes, combined with a related Trump administration rule, could result in 1.8 million more uninsured by 2034.",

    "text": "**AMA: Nine months ago I’d never sold a policy. Today my ACA book does about $85k/month with a $34 CPA and \\~3% loss. Here’s what I wish I’d researched before spending money.**\n\n**Quick context**\n\n* Licensed end of Oct ’24, started selling Jan ’25\n* Put **$100k** in over the year\n* I buy **live inbound callers only** (no cold lists)\n\n**How I handle calls (this mattered most)**\n\n* Calls only route to me when I’m not already on the phone, so I don’t miss people\n* If I miss a customer service call, I call back the same day—no exceptions\n* Clients get a real number that reaches me—my personal cell, 24/7. Hard work, but it built trust and referrals\n\n**What to research before you spend $1**\n\n* Refund policy in writing: what counts as a bad call, how returns work, when credits land\n* Answer/contact rates by hour and source (real stats, not guesses)\n* County/ZIP targeting that matches ACA networks I can actually place\n* Consent/compliance language used before the call reaches me\n* Delivery control so I can cap/pause and touch every caller the same day\n\n**Money I wasted**\n\n* “Cheap” calls with vague or slow refunds\n* Buying volume before the intake script and follow-up rhythm were dialed in\n* Fancy software I didn’t use every day\n\n**Money that paid off**\n\n* Speed + clarity: short script, quick verify, clear next step, same-day follow-up\n* Call recording + quick QC: 10 minutes a day fixed leaks I couldn’t see in a spreadsheet\n* Knowing ACA cold: networks, formularies, prior auth, renewal quirks—explained in plain English (be the expert and put people at ease)\n\n**My lead-vendor checklist now**\n\n1. Refund/credit rules and SLA (in writing)\n2. Sample ads so I know there’s no fake incentivizing\n3. State targeting and delivery hours\n4. I can throttle/stop calls instantly\n\n**Process that moved the needle**\n\n* 3 steps: verify basics → solve the real problem → set a specific next time/action\n* 1–2 plan options max, with reasons (menus slow everything down)\n* Same-day everything, or conversion drops\n* Post-enrollment customer care (ID cards, network checks, “what now?”) drives referrals and keeps churn low (\\~3%)\n\n**Simple weekly scoreboard**\n\n* Reached calls / total calls\n* Kept appointments\n* Submits\n* Time to first touch\n* Service issues per member\n* Refund rate / turnaround\n* CPA (\\~$34) and trend\n\n**If I had to start over (I could do it much cheaper—$10–20k)**\n\n* Spend the first 2–3 weeks on scripts, routing, notes template, and a manual follow-up schedule\n* Trial multiple **live-call** vendors in tiny batches; only scale the one that proves contactability **and** refunds\n* Keep the tech boring: I run everything in Excel and Google Calendar\n* Give clients a real number and show up—that’s what makes referrals happen\n\nThat’s my playbook and the lessons. AMA about the research, spend, setup, or what I’d cut or double down on.",

    "text": "from the depths of my soul I really need to know the truth of this I have a family to support. \n\ni’ve been selling life insurance for about two years now. I was attracted to all these big checks and the lifestyle that you can control your money and just buy leads and set appointments and do one call closes over the phone and you could make 200k, 300k 500 K a year. and there are tons of people showcase that are doing it. Even twenty something yr olds. \n\nSo I got in and I bought the leads and I grinded my face off. I managed to make over 100 K within a handful of months. \nI thought I had it made and I cracked the code. \n\nAnd then I realized I still felt broke. \nall these crappy lead companies. these leads were supposed to be exclusive and I know they sold them to 10 other agents. I would sometimes dial eight hours a day and only have 1 to 3 genuine conversations. that’s crap. \n\nI was on the phone all day long I was buying thousands of dollars a month in Leads.\n\nThen the chargebacks started hitting me. \nAnd now I have to work for free for the rest of the month. \n\nBut you Gotta keep buying more leads\n\nAnd then customers would call in and need things. \nI needed to call the carriers. \n\nbut I didn’t really have time to talk to them because I need to buy more leads and call more people and make more sales. \n\neventually I realized how unhappy I was I was working a lot and yet I still felt paycheck to paycheck despite writing 20-30k a month. and I feel like I could not get ahead. \nWhat the heck? \n\nThen I looked at some of my leaders I was following and they were making 400 K plus a year. and I thought if I ever get to their level then I will be an easy Street then I could take my foot off the gas and I could have a great lifestyle. \n\nWrong. \n\nAll of them are working their faces off. they couldn’t take time off.  they weren’t spending time with her kids.  they didn’t have time to answer my calls. Or to train me really. And what’s more they didn’t even seem happy. they had this stressed out look in their face all the time.  I thought how could that be? \n\nwas this all a lie? is the money and lifestyle even real? \n\nI saw this guy who wrote $1 million on stage. \nCome to find out he spent 250 K on Leads\n30 to 40% fall off. and then minus the guaranteed issue and administrative costs like his dialer or admin… reallly he was making like 150-200k.\n\nThat ain’t a million. \n\nAnd. He was working 7 days a week. And stressed out couldn’t take his foot off the gas. \n\nNot worth it. \n\nI don’t want that lifestyle. \n\nIf I’m making 400 K a year I better be able to enjoy time with my family and come home for dinner and take nice vacations and make money moves  and investments. \n\nMy goal is to have the lifestyle not to be a slave on the phone seven days a week 10 hours a day. \n\nI’m assuming it’s just unsustainable biz model.  and you’re always fighting off chargebacks . And the lead cost will  eat up all your profits and that’s why most agents won’t stick around. \n\nIs that the cold truth? \n\nam I chasing a pipe dream ? is there ever a way off the escalator if you are selling by yourself without a team? I was mainly doing final expense and mortgage protection..  ",

    "title": "5 Reasons Why Selling Insurance May Not Be For You...",
    "text": "While selling insurance has been a blessing for myself and many others, the reality is that the business is a brutal battle for most, certainly not for the faint of heart, and probably isn’t an ideal fit for most who enter it.\n\nAfter working with thousands of agents since 2013, I think there’s 5 core reasons why upwards of 90% or more of new agents eventually fail out of the insurance sales business. Here they are:\n\n1. **Opportunity Mismatch:** Understanding what you TRULY want from this business is crucial. Are you aiming to recruit agents, sell insurance directly, or something else? Many enter this field based on recruiters and agencies’ misdirection and empty promises, only to discover that their goals never actually aligned. My advice: don’t jump in bed with the first agency that wants you. Instead, take time to evaluate what you want out of the insurance business, and work to find an agency that supports your vision.  \n2. **Multi-Level Marketing Pitfalls:** A significant portion of agents inadvertently join MLMs, where the focus is more on recruitment than on sales. These agency structures can drain your resources while offering lower commission rates than average. If you find yourself in a situation where the agency’s leadership heralds recruitment over selling, you’re likely in an MLM. If that’s the case, then get the heck out ASAP.  \n3. **Lack of Training:** Many new agents fail due to insufficient training. It’s critical you find a mentor who can provide constructive feedback, and help you when the going gets tough. Without the correct type of training and support systems in place, failure is much more likely.  \n4. **No Lead Generation System:** Your leads are the lifeblood of your insurance sales business. Without a solid prospecting system, you’ll find it nearly impossible to succeed. Therefore, it’s essential to ensure that the agency you join has a reliable lead generation strategy proven by others to work.  \n5. **Entrepreneurial Shock:** Transitioning from a regular paycheck to a commission only income can be jarring. Many new agents are unprepared for the unpredictability of entrepreneurial life, including managing taxes and budgeting personal expenses without a guaranteed salary. My advice: take time to ensure you can manage your financial affairs on a straight commission. Consider salary plus bonus or no-cost lead system agencies to help eliminate or defer costs, so you can better eliminate stress that formulates from risking your money in lead systems.",

    "title": "Got fired today by an Incompetent State Farm agent for mentioning toxic behavior",
    "text": "Just venting here because I'm frustrated. I started at a State Farm agency in my area right on new years. I came in with experience. This agent is new (3 years in) and the level of incompetence at the agency was astounding. \n\nHe had nothing prepared for me when I started so I had to literally set my own job up for myself including doing all of my own onboarding. He has 3 staff members: a 55 year old lady who left dental hygiene 2 years ago to work for him and 2 part time girls who plan on leaving the agency. \n\nThey have zero sales process at all. They don't even call leads but instead simply text a price and never follow up. They've destroyed their book of business by nonstop texting them unsolicited life quotes so much so you can't even get them to pick up for service calls. \n\nThe agent is being babysat by the sales leader because they cannot even hit auto quotas before I came in. Despite that he and the lady choose to work 4 days a week, and he pays the lady a base salary. \n\nAnyways, I've been DRIVING sales in. I outsold the entire office by a pretty hefty margin and set up a months worth of life appointments. \n\nHowever, the 55 year old lady is incredibly toxic and the agent warned me about her multiple times when I started. She's the type who thinks the owns the office and despite being a team member herself, micromanages the team members. The problem is that she's not good at sales.\n\nWe had a meeting to figure out how to hit our goals and drive in leads. The fix is pretty simple, but when I lightly make a suggestion she would cut me off and shut me down and get snappy. \n\nI've also been having a problem with her controlling the new leads and giving me only the ones with no contact info. She hasn't been afraid to hijack my active leads and appointments either. \n\nNonetheless, yesterday she pulled the stunt with the leads so I messaged on our team chat and said I professionally said something about (I was nonconfrontational). \n\nI shot my agent a text and let him know what I've been dealing with with her. He brought me in this morning and fired me. \n\nNever working for a captive agent again...",

    "title": "So you've been offered a position as an Agency Owner...",
    "text": "**EDIT\n\nI wrote this post mostly for those with little to no experience in the insurance industry who are being preyed on by recruiters.  \n\nLet me be blunt:  Until you have several years of success and experience in this industry under your belt you have NO DAMN BUSINESS owning your own agency and anyone who tells you otherwise is not your friend.\n\nEven if you've successfully written millions in premium, that's no guarantee that opening an agency will make you a profit. \n\n\nPrequel:  It's May 2025, Most major companies are slashing compensation for their agencies and agency owners to the bone.  Allstate in particular is making headlines for this.  Do a LOT of research!!! \n\nIf you take nothing else from this post, remember this:  The more complicated their compensation plan/commission grid is, the more they're trying to hide.\n\nOr,  the MORE WORDS they use, the LESS PAY you're going to get.\n\nSo you've been offered a position as an agency owner...\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n**EDIT 2**\nI wrote this as a list of red flags to watch out for.\n\nNot all companies operate the same way, obviously.  That being said, companies change.\n\nIf you do find an opportunity to which none of the below applies, I'm genuinely happy for you!  Just remember to be vigilant; companies change.  And not all of these red flags will be visible until it's too late.  Ask lots of questions.  Get things in writing.  Ask about their ability to change your contract/compensation.  \n\nOwning an insurance agency is a huge investment/commitment.  Make that decision accordingly.\n\n\n1: First, you need to understand that you were almost certainly given this offer to meet a recruiting quota.   I have had successful, wealthy people lie through their teeth to me about NEEDING more agents, DESPERATELY LOOKING TO BRING IN agents.  Those must be some pretty good bonuses they're getting if they're willing to go to that much effort.\n\n1A: Few, if any companies actually NEED another agency in your city. Here's the thing:  Let's say I own a \"Farmville Insurance\" agency in my city.  Eventually, Farmville Insurance is going to decide that it's time to expand, and here's the important part- they're going to ask me to expand my agency FIRST.  Only after I turn it down will they look to an external hire.  And If I wasn't interested, why would you be?  If there was REALLY enough money to be made, I would be doing it.  \n\n1B: If you do open a \"Farmville Insurance\" Agency in a town that already has one or more \"Farmville Insurance\" agencies, you will spend the rest of your life dealing with confused clients who can't figure out why you're not their agent and why you can't help them.  99% of people are going to just google \"Farmville Insurance\" and call the first number that comes up (Or say \"Hey Siri call Farmville Insurance\").  No, they will most certainly NOT be taking the time to distinguish between agencies.   Also look forward to having to play \"Is this somebody else's client/prospect\" EVERY TIME you have a potential sale.   Not to mention having to worry about the other agencies poaching your potential clients.\n\n1C: Your recruiter will be more than happy to tell you all about the small number of successful agents, and how well they are doing, but the important question is HOW did they do it, and more importantly, is it reproducible?  Here's an example:  When I worked for AFLAC, one agent was successful because she was the first AFLAC agent with access to the Air Force base, and she opened a bunch of accounts there.  That's not reproducible.  Another agent opened up once-in-a-lifetime accounts like the city, and the school district.  That's not reproducible either. At any rate, you're not interested in the outliers, you're interested in how the average agent performs.\n\n1D: What is their plan for you?  \n\nCold calling/door knocking?  That's a whole lot of unpaid work for very little return.  Who answers a random knock at the door anymore?  If you're calling businesses, the owner will NEVER be available.  If you're calling personal numbers, they're not going to answer some random number they don't know and talk to you about insurance.  Ok, I'm generalizing; but you don't run a profitable business off of the exceptions, you run it off of the rules, and cold calls/cold knocks that actually lead to a sale are NOT the rule.\n\nLeads?  Every vendor out there promises the hottest, freshest, most exclusive leads you've ever seen, and they're all absolute trash.  You will NEVER recover your investment.  Your $50-$100 \"exclusive, highly motivated\" leads either won't answer, will be disconnected, or won't have any idea why you're calling.\n\nNetworking?  Isn't every other agency in the area already doing this?  There are agents in my town that have been networking for 40+ years, how in the actual fuck am I supposed to network their clients away from them?  Same goes for \"working hard\" and \"good service\".  Every other agency in the area is already working hard and providing good service (or at least trying to).  \n\nWorking your warm market?  That'll be good for MAYBE 10 small policies if you're lucky.  Agents who manage to get (and keep) multiple large commercial accounts from their warm market are the exception, not the rule.  Remember, there's a LOT of people in your area selling insurance, some of whom have been doing this for 30+ years.  They've all been networking and schmoozing and making connections.  I guarantee you that any business owner you know also knows a dozen other insurance agents.\n\nIn case you haven't got the picture yet, they're going to load you up with \"success strategies\" that cost them nothing.  Stupid shit like \"Wake up early!!\"  \"Post on Facebook!!\"  \"Reach out to everyone you've ever met in your entire life!  They're going to be SO EXCITED to talk to you about insurance!!\"\n\nBottom line: you can't sell enough insurance to pay your bills by waking up at 4 AM and going to bed at 3 AM or calling every god damn person you went to high school with.  The only way you're going to write policies, ESPECIALLY in 2025 is better prices or better products, and a company that markets aggressively enough in your area that people are going to know who you are and what you offer.\n\n2: If the position is 1099 or 100% commission based, RUN!!  No salary means that the company has no investment in you and doesn't care if you fail.  Even worse is if it's 1099 AND a captive agency (which is quickly becoming the industry standard).  Oh, and of course 1099 comes with massive tax and accounting headaches.  And don't forget, you can't raise the price of your goods to cover your costs the way a restaurant can.\n\n2A:  \"Be your own boss!!\" means LITERALLY NOTHING in this Industry.  You will still have a manager to report to.  They will also have a manager whom you both report to.  You will have a contract which you are bound to.  You are at the utter mercy of the underwriting team.\n\n2B: As a 1099, you already know you're going to pay for LITERALLY EVERYTHING, but some companies won't even advertise for you!  They expect you to pay for that yourself.  If you're lucky, they may let you submit it for reimbursement, but first you have to pay for the whole thing yourself, THEN submit the expense, THEN pray to God or whomever that the marketing department deigns your expense acceptable of reimbursement.\n\n3: You will likely need at least $100,000 to invest, and you will likely not be profitable for AT LEAST 2 years, and that's with a lot of luck, and a lot of 70+ hour work weeks.  Many agency owners never turn a profit.  Many successful agency owners have a high-earning spouse who kept them afloat.  The vast majority of successful agency owners opened their agency decades ago.  The last 6 years have been awful for the industry and Life Insurance in particular has been exponentially more expensive to sell and more difficult to underwrite since COVID.\n\n3A: Don't forget to educate yourself on the true cost of itemizing deductions as a 1099 vs taking the standard deduction as a W2 and remember that deductions aren't tax refunds, they just reduce your taxable income. \n\n3B:  They may promise you a lot of bonuses for opening your own office, hiring associates etc...  But you need to have the money to put in first.  You don't get the bonuses until long after you invest the capital.  Oh and that $25,000 bonus was only if you buy a stand-alone building... you're renting an endcap, so you're not eligible for the bonus.  Whoops!!  Gotta love that fine print!\n\n4: As a new small business owner, people will expect you to prostrate yourself before them at any given opportunity.  Kiss the ring.  Make a donation.  Make another donation.  Buy some advertising from me.  Anyone who so much as looks at your business on Google will expect to be treated like royalty; after all, they're doing you a FAVOR by supporting you, (or considering supporting you).  Every idiot with 12 Tiktok followers thinks they're an Influencer and will expect preferential treatment.  Every idiot with 12 likes on their latest \"Podunk Whiners &amp; Complainers\" Facebook group post thinks they're an Influencer and will expect preferential treatment.   Every disappointment, especially the ones you have no control over, will be treated as a betrayal.  Everyone wants a favor.  Everyone wants a discount (even though giving one person a discount on insurance is illegal)\n\n5: None of your clients will understand that you are a human being and that you deserve time away from the business.  None of your clients will want anything to do with your associates/office staff, because they're too self-important for that.  They deserve only the OWNER of the agency, and they don't give a fuck if you're on vacation, or being operated on, or that you've been dead for 10 years.  \"What do you mean she's dead?  Can you give me her cell number?  When will she be back in the office?\"  They will also expect you to be available to meet with them with no advance notice and will not be able to understand why you're not available RIGHT THIS VERY SECOND.  They will send you emails and text messages on holidays, weekends and during earthquakes, evacuations and emergencies.  They will send you emails and text messages from noon till midnight and every possible time in-between.  They will assume that whatever they ask of you has already been done before they have even finished sending the message. \"Hi, I'm buying a car next week, you already have insurance on it right?  Kthanks!\"\n\n5b: An excerpt from an actual conversation with a client who wanted to talk to my Agency Owner, \"Michelle\":\n\nMe; \"I'm sorry, Michelle is meeting with another client right now, can I help you or take a message?\"\n\nClient:  \"WHAT?  A MEETING?   MICHELLE?!?  WHO IS THIS? HOW CAN SHE HAVE A MEETING AT 4:00 PM?  WHERE'S MICHELLE?  \n\n6: Look out for the scam within the scam- They'll allow you to open your own agency (Captive and 100% commission based of course) and in return, you'll be forced to RENT everything from them for eternity.  You will never be allowed to BUY the hardware/software etc...  You will be required to rent it from your company.  No exceptions or exclusions.  No, you can NOT go and BUY a filing cabinet, that's a violation of your contract! You'll need to rent our COMPLIANCE APPROVED filing cabinets for a small fee of $50/month per cabinet, every month, for the rest of your career.\n\n6A: They'll penalize you if your book of business isn't profitable for any given month.  This is absolutely ludicrous, as the whole point of insurance is to have a large enough risk pool, which one agent  will never be able to manage.  Imagine ONE claim ruining your profitability, and thus your paycheck while the company itself is still profitable.\n\n6B:  You've just invested over $100,000 into your new agency and you're struggling to find new clients?  Good News!  We've found another person who wants to open their own agency!  Your potential client pool has just been cut in half!\n\n\n7: Your contract/compensation grid is almost certainly subject to change at any time.  The products you are allowed to offer are almost certainly subject to change at any time.   Everything you were ever promised is almost certainly subject to change at any time.  That $25,000 Bonus we promised you for opening a new office?  That was the OLD contract, you're under the NEW contract which doesn't offer that bonus anymore.\n\n7B: None of those changes will EVER be to your benefit.",

    "title": "Allstate Insurance The Good Years",
    "text": "Yes there were good years being an Allstate Agent.  My father started in 1959 as an employee agent. Worked at a Sears store for ten years than an office.  \n\nThey had walk up customers at the Sears booth. Didn’t really need to prospect.  Most of the customer service was sent to a rep at a regional office. Agents were expected to just make sales.  \n\nBack then they had a program called “General Agent”.  If you were aged 50 and had 20 years you were allowed this title.  The idea was you only had to take care of your existing customers. No growth requirements, no quotas, no sales meetings, just product education. No real manager.   Just have a good loss ratio, good renewal rate and no customer complaints and they left you alone. My dad worked to age 70.  \n\nI started as an Allstate Agent in 1979 at the age of 22. No college degree,  did have six months experience as a part time agent at Farmers. \n\nI started in a Sears store and worked there for three years. It was shortly after that when things started to change. Around 1981 Sears bought Coldwell Banker real estate, Dean Witter financial service, and started a bank.  They created a financial center in Sears stores.  \n\nIt was a great program for new agents.  We were given a minimum guaranteed salary for three years.  After time your commissions with renewals exceeded your base You learned on the job and trained by your booth buddies. Built up a book of business and then moved to a neighborhood office.  We had full benefits, pension plan, and Sears profit sharing. \n\n\nIn 1999 they terminated employee agents and hired us back as independent contractors with no benefits. Still captive.  They promised us independence to run our agency as we saw fit.  We were told we could sell our agency to our children or anyone else when the time came. \n\nThen came sales quotas with the threat of contract termination if not met.  They added more and more of the back office work directly to our agency.  Commission changes came often.  It was hard as an “independent agency” to do long term planning as Allstate was constantly moving the goal posts. \n\nIt became mandatory that after hours we transferred our phones to a call center for service.  This is when they started stealing our customers. \n\nAfter the 2007 recession things really started to ramp up. I was considered a small agency with a small staff. Always met my “expected results”,  made all the trips, low loss ratio and very high renewal ratio.  Had a good relationship with management. But they figured they didn’t want small agencies anymore. They put pressure on us and encouraged larger agents to buy us out. More commission changes and then the threats got worse.  \n\nThey were now putting restrictions on who we could sell our agencies to. If they didn’t like you they would not approve the sell. They give you a list of approved buyers who were their friends. We had a sales manager that would deny a sale but approve their own spouse to buy it. \n\nIn 2010 I had enough.  It was the first of the year and we were at the yearly kickoff meeting.  \nThese are usually fun and motivating. Management would tell us of all the opportunities and exciting payoff trips.  But that year they divided us into two groups.  Larger agencies and smaller agencies. I was is the small agency group.  In the meeting there was no hoopla no encouragement about the upcoming year. Basically just threaten us to sale or face pulling our appointment. \n\nI left the meeting and put my agency up for sale. I was only 55 and didn’t plan on this. The stress was killing me. I had some family stress along with this and it became too much. Since they liked me I was able to sell my agency to a buyer of my choice.  \n\nI had to sell the big view house on the hill and get rid of the Mercedes and BMW to make this work.  I started an online business and did well. \n\nDuring my employee time with Allstate I was vested in a small pension. I get about $2000 a month from this.  Allstate was very good for me. Allstate has put food on my table since I was a kid as my dad was an agent.  I still have all my personal policies with Allstate. \n\nSorry for the long post. I read about the struggles you all are having now with Allstate. Just wanted to share my experience. \n\n\n",

    "text": "To preface:\n\n\\-Yes, I am 19 years old and in college. \n\n\\-Yes, I understand the enormous amount of risk this is. \n\n\\-Yes, I am probably biting more than I can chew. \n\n\n\nMy background:\n\nI started in insurance at 16 years old, working as a sales specialist (gathering info from leads and passing it onto a producer; basically like a warm transfer) this was for a State Farm agent in my home state of Kansas. I excelled at what I did. And looked forward to getting my insurance licenses as soon as I turn 18.\n\n  \nMoved to Washington State in Aug 2023 (at the time still 16) and focused on my junior year of high school, no work.   \n\n\nOctober of 2024: I turned 18 and got my P&amp;C licenses. Started working part-time for a local, mid-sized State Farm agency in WA state in Jan of 2025.\n\nI also excelled at my job and by May of 2025 I had gotten a raise and went working full-time. I was a fast learner and sales came easy when I was the main acquisition guy.\n\nJune-Sept 2025: Grinded for my boss, trained new hires, whilst still maintaining sales goals each month. \\~30-35k/mo new business premium during that time. On track for a 80k gross salary.\n\nEarly October 2025: I felt that there wasn't much left to learn, I had gone through selling P&amp;C commercial lines, as well as the occasional life/disability income policy. So I left the agency in hopes of finding a local brokerage to work with. \n\nThroughout October: I applied for 30+ jobs in my area (linkedin, indeed, company website, even emailing direct to agency owners). I had gotten 5 interviews and all were duds because they didn't believe that I could juggle college and work at the same time. \n\n  \nEnd of October, my dad comes to visit me and asks me to come back home (Kansas). He has been asking me to come home since I moved there 2 years ago. I told him the only way I would move back is if there were \"more opportunity in Kansas\". He told me he would support my business endeavors and offered me $50,000 to start my brokerage. \n\n  \nOctober 30th: I am now home in Kansas, started my LLC, EIN, Business Bank account, domain, website, google business profile, etc. I am now in the process of transferring my WA resident licenses to KS resident, and applying for an agency license through the state. \n\nI will be making my home address my business address and working from home in my own designated office. Whilst going to my local university. \n\n\n\nWhat is some advice you guys could give me? \n\nDirect appointments are probably not an option for me, so I am only looking into aggregators like Smart Choice, First Connect, and SIAA. \n\nI prioritize freedom and exit clause. I am leaning towards smart choice. \n\n\n\nOpinions???\n\n  \nI know they use EZlynx so I will have to learn it, but if there is a aggregator/cluster I can work with that allows me to choose my own CRM/VOIP/Rater that would be great. \n\nI enjoy State Farm's software. Salesforce CRM, Cisco Jabber VOIP\n\n\n\n(also I have 3 mentors, all SF agents I've grown close to, but I would love to connect on linkedin and possibly have a mentor on the independent side. please PM me to connect!!!) ANY ADVICE IS GREATLY APPRECIATED. \n\n  \n\n\n  \n",

    "title": "Future outlook of insurance as a career",
    "text": "Insurance is in a tough place right now. We are still growing, but right now most of the quotes I am doing are just re-writes for our existing clients, due to premiums jumping anywhere from 20% to even 50% on some properties. We do mostly P&amp;C with quiet a few small businesses. I'm currently 28, I've been doing insurance for 2 years, and have enjoyed it so far. We've done well, and my wife and I were even able to buy a home last year with a 20% down payment. But I'm apprehensive about the future. With AI, increasingly large natural disasters due to a myriad of factors, a tightening economy, and consistently high inflation, I'm concerned that this won't be a tenable career in 5-10 years. Another huge factor is home insurance, I'm concerned that it will get so expensive that people that have their homes paid off will opt out, and only those with mortgages will keep insurance. Which will cause premiums to go even higher for those that are forced to insure their homes due to their mortgage.\n\nAll in all, I would just like to get a feel for what you guys think. I'm thinking about maybe training myself in another area so that I have something to fall back on. If you guys have any advice, it would be appreciated. Thanks.",

    "text": "I’ve been lurking here for a while, and like many others, I’ve been considering getting licensed to sell health insurance. I’ve noticed there are *a ton* of weekly posts asking “Should I get into insurance?” and most of the responses are really positive and encouraging.\n\nBut what surprises me is what’s **NOT** being discussed much:\n\n**#1 Major carriers are cutting commissions or removing them entirely**. Here are some examples:\n\n* **United Health Care** will stop paying commissions on 100+ Medicare Advantage plans and all PDPs in over 20 states starting July 1, 2025. The NAIFA denounced UHC's decision to cut agent commissions.\n* **Aetna** is withdrawing from the ACA marketplace and slashing commissions after 2025.\n* **Cigna, Centene, Elevance (Anthem)** are all making similar moves.\n\n**#2 The recent passing of the new \"Big Beautiful Bill\".**\n\nFrom what I can tell, these are pretty major shifts and could seriously impact how agents make a living going forward. Yet almost none of this shows up in the “how do I start” threads. Why?\n\nSo, I wanted to ask more directly:\n\n* Why isn’t there more discussion about these changes here? Is the impact overstated, or are we just not seeing the effects *yet*?\n* Do veteran agents think ACA/Medicare will still be viable long-term?\n* Should newcomers treat this as a full-time career or more of a side hustle moving forward?\n* How are current agents planning to adapt in the next 5-10 years?\n\nGenuinely curious. I’m not trying to be negative. I'm just surprised there isn’t more open talk about what seems like some pretty big red flags for the industry.\n\nWould love to hear what those of you already in the trenches think. Thanks!",

    "title": "Warning: My Experience with Symmetry Financial Group – Please Read Before Joining",
    "text": "Hey Reddit,\nI’ve been in the insurance industry since 2021 and have had success in multiple roles. I know what real mentorship and growth look like. That’s why I feel the need to warn others about my experience with Symmetry Financial Group — because it was one of the most toxic, disorganized, and emotionally draining environments I’ve ever worked in.\n\nHere are the biggest red flags I encountered:\n\t\n•\tThe leads are extremely aged. I was handed leads from as far back as 2016. Calling people who haven’t requested life insurance info in nearly a decade felt unethical — more like harassment than service. It genuinely made me uncomfortable.\n\t\n•\tThe culture is toxic. Uplines and agency owners frequently humiliate agents on Zoom calls in front of everyone. There’s no support — just power plays, ego, and public shaming.\n\t\n•\tYou’re not in control of your own business. They make you ask for permission to get licensed in new states, claiming they won’t get paid if you get licensed somewhere they aren’t. It’s controlling and makes no sense if this is “your business.”\n\t\n•\tShaming over conferences. Can’t afford to attend one of their big events? Be ready to get publicly called out and guilted like you’re not serious about your career. It’s manipulative and unprofessional.\n\t\n•\tThe training is the worst I’ve seen in this industry. There’s no real structure, no proper onboarding, and no consistent support. You’re left confused, overwhelmed, and underprepared.\n\t\n•\tIt affected my mental health. I’ve never struggled with anxiety — not even in high-pressure sales environments — but while working with SFG, I had debilitating anxiety that impacted every area of my life. As soon as I walked away, that anxiety vanished. That tells you everything.\n\nThe good news? I’ve since joined a different IMO with real leadership, training, and respect — and I’m flourishing now. This experience taught me that it’s not the industry that’s the problem — it’s the people you align yourself with.\n\nIf you’re thinking about joining Symmetry Financial Group, please think twice. Don’t ignore the red flags. You deserve better.",

    "text": "There isn’t much anyone can do with this, so it’s mostly a vent. \n\nI’m a captive who has been open 4 years. I won’t say the name of the carrier here because I don’t want to throw shade. I actually love being an agent with them overall. It’s just this one tech issue that’s killing me. \n\nFirst three years were great. We grew about $1M in book size each of those years. Was in the top 3 in our territory for auto production last year. 75% of our business came from Google ads. Spent about $4k/mo there and the ROI was better than any other lead or marketing method I’ve tried in my 20+ year career. \n\nWas paying a management company to run the ads and dump the clicks off on a quote generation page, which fed into our CRM. \n\nLast October that just ground to a halt. We had zero leads. I talked to the ad manager and all the analytics looked great. We were getting the same number of clicks as always.  \n\nStart digging in with corporate. Someone there showed me backend data. I had 100+ visits to our quote start page but ZERO quotes generated from there. They tried blaming the ad company and I called BS. Going from a 50% conversion rate to quotes to a 0% is not possible. \n\nI eventually had friends go to my quote website directly. I got none of those leads in my CRM. \n\nI ran this up three or four different departments in corporate. Someone finally acknowledged that sometimes the CRM software can break on the backend and not populate the information from our domain vendors quote page. The problem is that they admitted nobody in corporate knows the CRM coding to fix it when this happens. \n\nThe real rub is that we are contractually obligated to use the corporate approved domain vendor. If I did the logical thing and create a new website with a different hosting company- it would be considered cause to terminate my contract. \n\nI keep pushing different people at corporate and it’s just dead ends. We’re now coming up on a full year of not being able to run Google ads. This year we’re looking at $300k of growth after three straight $1M years. \n\nI generally have loved everything about my experience being a captive owner with this company.

And I don’t expect the SIE and Series 6 exam prep will make you qualified any more than the P&amp;C exam prep makes you an insurance expert. \n\nI have a great deal of confidence that when I give clients insurance advice, I have an absolute understanding that what I tell them is sound. There’s a lot of trust I’ve built with my book over the years. The idea of using that relationship to convince people to trust me in an area where I have zero previous experience…. gives me heartburn. \n\nAt the same time, I’m missing a fairly large opportunity if I don’t pursue the path the company is incentivizing. \n\nAnyone out there in a similar situation? \n\n",

People always call the phone or put in an online email submission for a quote. \n\nAlmost 70% of these people are unqualified due to claims history, a need to put a 16y/o driver on the auto policy (comes out stupid high always), strict underwriting rules ex.

    "title": "For New Agents: 2 Tips to Find a Great Insurance Agency to Work For",
    "text": "Finding the right insurance agency to work for is one of the most critical decisions you’ll make in your career. The right agency can set you up for success, while the wrong one can lead to frustration, burnout, and ultimately, failure. \n\nSo how do you make sure you’re making the right choice? \n\n*It all comes down to DUE DILIGENCE and NOT SETTLING.*\n\n# Tip #1: Do Your Due Diligence – Research Like Your Future Depends on It (Because It Does!)\n\nThe fact that you’re here on Reddit, taking the time to research the insurance industry, already puts you ahead of most people. What I’ve seen is that most new insurance agents jump into an agency because of flashy marketing, big promises, or a hyped-up recruiter. \n\nDon’t fall for this trip. Slow your roll, and consider the following before you jump into bed with the first agency you meet:\n\n1. **Talk to Multiple Agents in the Agency**\n\n* Find out what current agents think about the agency. What your recruiter presents versus what the agency is really like can be dramatically different.\n* Ask them about their experience, training, support, and commission structure. \n* When talking to the hiring manager or recruiter, look for red flags—does he dodge questions? Are they hesitant to speak openly? Are they telling you only what you want to hear?\n\n1. **Ask for References**\n\n* A great agency should have nothing to hide. Ask the owner or recruiter, “Can you give me the contact info of three agents I can email with questions?”\n* If they hesitate or act like that’s a problem, consider it a red flag. An agency that delivers on its promises will not mind assisting.\n* When you reach out to these references, ask:\n   * How long have you been with the agency?\n   * What kind of support do they provide?\n   * Are they transparent about commissions and fees?\n\n1. **Check for Transparency**\n\n* A great agency will be upfront about everything: the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n* If you feel like they’re sugarcoating or avoiding certain topics, dig deeper. If you still get resistance, find another agency to partner with.\n* A company with integrity has nothing to hide.\n\n# Tip #2: Interview Multiple Agencies – Don’t Settle for the First One That Sounds Good\n\nThink about this: Would you marry the first person who asks you on a date? Probably not. Likewise, why commit to the first agency that offers you a contract?\n\nExploring multiple options ensures that you find the best fit for your skills, goals, and personality. \n\n# The Risks of Choosing the Wrong Agency\n\n* Joining the wrong agency is costly for you. The wrong choice can waste months (or even years) of your time. In fact, many agents flat-out quit the business altogether.\n* The right agency will *want* you to explore other options because they know they offer something valuable. Further, shrewd agencies know that mis-hires cost the company tremendously, and prefer agents that partner with them are all-in and totally clear about expectations BEFORE they start to minimize post-hiring problems.\n\n# Tips On How to Compare Agencies\n\n1. **Meet with at least two or three agencies.**\n   * Get a feel for their culture, leadership, and values.\n   * See how they compare in terms of training, commission structure, and product offerings.\n2. **Ask Hard Questions.**\n   * What kind of training do you offer new agents?\n   * What are the biggest challenges agents face at your company?\n   * How do you support agents when they struggle?\n3. **Look for Agencies That Invest in Their Agents.**\n   * Do they have ongoing training programs?\n   * Are there mentorship opportunities?\n   * Is leadership accessible, or is it just a corporate hierarchy?\n\nRemember, when you compare multiple agencies, you put yourself in the driver’s seat. You’re making a decision from a position of strength, not desperation.\n\n# Why Taking Your Time Could Save Your Career\n\nToo many agents fail not because they’re bad at sales, but because they chose the wrong agency. They get stuck in bad contracts, receive little to no support, or realize too late that they were sold a dream that doesn’t match reality.\n\nTake your time. Be patient. There’s no rush. The extra few weeks (or even months) you spend vetting agencies could mean the difference between thriving in this business and washing out before you ever get started.\n\n# A Few Last Points:\n\n* Don’t let the excitement of getting licensed push you into a hasty decision.\n* The right agency will set you up for long-term success.\n* The wrong agency can cost you time, money, and confidence.\n\nThanks for reading =)",

    "title": "Am I wasting my talent?",
    "text": "I got licensed about a year and half ago. I originally started out with an Allstate Agent with very small base pay ($1500 month) plus commissions. They had me start out with Auto policies. I must have quoted over 100 people but couldn’t compete price wise. Wrote two policies, 1 auto, 1 small commercial, made $76 in commission in two months. At that time they weren’t comfortable showing me home insurance yet, due to my performance. I stopped working for them. \n\nWe are a two income family. I needed to find work with a stable income and I needed to find it fast. I took a salaried job with a big independent company in my area. I figured I would work there for a year or so to learn the business. Well it’s been a year. I really like the company I work for, everyone is good people and they genuinely care about their employees, but the workload is massive, partly because as a P&amp;C account manager I don’t have a CSR. So I’m doing ALL the work, quoting new business, applications, policy changes, taking payments, payment reminders, renewals, cancellations, answering phones, transferring calls. I even work on weekends sometimes even though I’m technically not getting paid for it just so I can get caught up and not fall behind or get stressed during my work hours. It’s a lot. I feel like a have a pretty good handle on how to do the job. I’m a quick study and generally good at whatever I try. I’m told by customers and my managers that I’m doing a great job as well and for the most part I enjoy the work. Customers even refer me to their friend and family.\n\nMy question is this. I’m making salary of 45k my first year but with no option to make commissions. I’m also licensed in life insurance as well but they wouldn’t pay me commission on any life policies I wrote so I won’t write life for them. I see tons of job offers for agents that are base salary plus commission. Would I be putting my talents to better use with a company that offers commissions? I feel like I would most definitely make more money in the long run but my financial situation isn’t one where I can take 2 to 3 years building a book of business so feel kind of stuck. I would need to make at least 45k a year to leave where I’m at now. Is that doable? Am I being unrealistic? Or am I being taking advantage of by my salary only position? ",

    "text": "Background, I'm mid 30s, 2 kids, and I've just about had it with my extremely high stress/toxic culture job (in a healthcare/pharma marketing related field). I have a few years of savings and I'm ready to pivot my career into something more personally rewarding.....I'm seriously considering insurance!\n\n\n\nI know how to build a brand, manage CRM systems, create effective communications (the one-on-one sales aspect is new to me, but I know I can figure it out). Plus I have a solid background in many aspects of prescription drugs and healthcare (i've taken a practice licensing test without cracking a book and got a 72%, so there's more for me to learn, but a solid foundation)\n\n\n\nThe idea is to start a medicare-focused agency, brand it to appeal to the communities I want to target, partner with an FMO, and begin sourcing paid and earned leads directly (this is not a challenge for me, I'm been doing it in the pharma space for years). \n\n\n\nMy goal is to use the next 6 months to start up the business, get my licenses and begin lead generation. I would then quit my job in time for the end of year enrollment season, see how that goes - (pick up some light contract work throughout next year to supplement my income) and then go all-in on the business late 2026 - hoping that I can be clearing $150k+ in 2027 and back to 200k+ earnings in 2028. Over time I'd branch out into other lines, but I want to keep a narrow focus for now so I can effectively source clients.\n\n\n\nThat's the high-level plan, of course their are many more details that I'm figuring out (I'm building  financial projections, comparing FMOs, analyzing the competitive landscape for local agents and the large nationals...and a lot more to make sure I'm going in with solid goals and expectations)\n\n\n\nSo, am I crazy to get into this world? What are the biggest pitfalls to watch out for that will get in the way of me being successful? What is the biggest deterrents for those starting out that will my make feel burnt?",

Just take a msg and tell em im busy”. \n\nMy agent says and does that. But then expects me to go out to do the same to go through that.

    "title": "Leaving New York Life (and surviving)",
    "text": "If you have worked for New York Life (or one of the other captives) as an agent, financial professional etc, there will come a point in your career when you'll ask whether the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.   I've posted parts of this before in response to other questions in this and other forums, but I've updated it and consolidated into one place.  \n\nHere's my experience -- other advisors who have left NYL or Northwestern (or others) can feel free to chime in on their own experiences, thoughts, tips.   Anyone who wants to reach out to me by DM with questions can do so.   I honestly think NYL is a financially strong company -- and in that way, a great company.  It just wasn't a great company for me.   \n\n Here's a few tips for planning / executing your departure, and some things to think about on the Comp side if you do leave (especially if you're staying in the financial services industry)\n\nMY STORY:   I was an EC level agent for 5 years.   I earned well, I played by the rules, I contributed to the office, helping to grow my partner's team etc..   However I got to a point after a few years that I felt like management and product consultants were a revolving door (with each manager bringing a new sales objective/technique/language model and product consultants changing so fast I couldn't keep up), support and training for securities sales was non-existant (ask your Mainstay Rep how many offices he/she has to cover, then ask the Annuity Rep the same question) and made change to a wealth management practice where I wasn't obligated to sell life insurance and annuities in order to keep my Council status.   \n\nIf you're a NYLifer -- Look at your comp -- if you're not PC or CC level, you're getting absolutely hosed on GDC and quite frankly you're subsidizing those who are PC and CC.   NYL pays 55% GDC for EC agents, and 35% for QC agents.  This is WELL BELOW industry standards if you're managing a book of invested assets, and especially if you're in the advisory side of the business.    When they changed the Council points system back in 2021/2022 they pretty-much put cement shoes on new advisors who want to follow the financial track.\n\nTIPS FOR LEAVING / ITEMS YOU NEED TO KNOW BEFORE YOU WALK OUT THE DOOR\n\n1.   Your Ledger at NYL-- If you're leaving NYL of your own volition, plan your exit based upon your ledger -- and be sure to zero that sucker out before you submit your letter of resignation and to do so BEFORE they tack-on the monthly service fees that they charge and AFTER all your commissions have come through.  This is a delicate dance, and you may have to ask for multiple ledger clears that final week, but the last thing you want to do is have a balance held hostage.   If you can time it to leave on the last day of a month or the first day of a new month, this stops those monthly tech charges before they are posted.  If you have ongoing income coming from a BGA, make sure it is NOT routed through NYL and goes directly to your personal bank account.   I can't provide any input if you have a debit balance on your account -- but the quicker you sever ties, the easier it will be.\n\n2.  Recently sold/placed Policies -- If you've placed any policies (life or annuity) within 90 days of leaving the company, be sure to have copies of delivery receipts.   I had 2 instances where they claimed the policy was never delivered and tried to claw-back commissions, but luckily I had copies of delivery receipts.    If you have a client who backs out of a policy within the first year of the policy (and after you've left), they may try to charge you for that as well.   If you've made the decision to move, be judicious in what business you take as you wind down at NYL.   I know of an agent who was sent to collections over this bullshit.  Also, if you are detached from the office and must file weekly correspondence / check receipts logs, make sure this is done so they don't have anything to report to FINRA or the Ins Commissioner.\n\nIf you're staying in the business, its actually not a bad idea to consider placing life policies with other carriers during your last few months so you can keep any trailing commissions (and as referenced above, control any cancellations).   NYL makes New Org work with Crump as their BGA.   Once you get out of your initial contract, it isn't a bad idea to find a BGA other than Crump.   Commissions through there won't be included in your Council Points, however you will likely get better service, and if you leave you'll be able to maintain that relationship.   \n\n3.   Your Clients -- When you started working with NYL, you signed a 2 year non-solicit.  Note -- this is NOT a non-compete, its a non-solicit, meaning that YOU cannot approach these clients.  The difference between the two is that a non-compete would mean that you can't work in the industry.   Don't be bullied into thinking that this is what you have -- because people throw around words that they don't understand.  The agent who was succeeded my book was convinced that I couldn't talk to my clients because this is what management told him to say.  I disabused him of this notion, and had to do some damage control when he started talking to clients.\n\nSo under a \"non-solicit\" -- you cannot solicit business from existing NYL clients.   They are mainly concerned (see below) with annuity, life and LTC business, and not necessarily concerned with non-annuity investment business.  If you read the contract, there's nothing saying that clients can't approach you.   \n\nNYL takes this shit seriously, and they have a bunch of lawyers sitting around signing nasty and threatening letters all day.  You'll likely get a UPS about a week after you leave with a copy of the Non-Solicit you signed.\n\nA good model I got from another advisor who left the company a few years prior to me was to contact your clients that you want to continue to work with, and ask them to call YOU after your departure date.   You can tell them you're working on something good that will benefit them in the long-term, but you shouldn't tell them outright that you're leaving as that could violate your non-solicit.   Be very careful what you say -- and if you can put together a script so you say the SAME THING each time, you'll thank yourself later.  I cannot confirm that I employed this tactic.    \n\nSo hopefully if you did the \"call me\" thing, your phone starts lighting up with client calls.  Be sure to KEEP A LOG OF WHEN THEY CALL YOU as you may need this.  As you likely know from your FINRA exams, you cannot and should not tell them that they have to move but you should be prepared to give them good reasons to move.   For my advisory clients this was simple -- \"Thanks for reaching out to me.  Sorry I couldn't explain what was going on prior to XXX.   Hey do you want to save 25 bp AND keep working with me, or do you want your account transfered to someone who you've never met?  My new affiliation allows me to charge a lower rate, offer better product etc etc\"\n\nNote that NYL will not let you touch any annuity or life business for 2 years (even if the annuity is out of surrender).   If you have invested assets (things held at Eagle, NYLIFE Securities, or held away at a Mutual Fund company) you can bring those assets with you as long as you didn't \"solicit\" the business (See above).   \n\nSeriously -- don't fuck around with the annuities or entice people to replace life policies.  I know this is/was an easy pay day at NYL, but it just isn't worth it.   If you have someone coming out of a term policy, make sure you document the absolute SHIT out of your interactions with them before you put in the application for replacement.   If you're moving family business, you should be able to do so without trouble, but again -- be able to back it up.   Your nephew and niece are easy moves -- but if you placed a policy on your 2nd cousin and didn't identify them as \"family\" when you wrote up the life policy, you're opening yourself to trouble.  Is a $30 check-o-matic even worth it?\n\nIf (after you leave) a client calls and wants to cancel policy or needs policy service, be sure to let them know that you no longer work with NYL and cannot provide them service or advice about their policies anymore.   My general practice would be to give them the 1-800 number.   After this happens, LOG IT.  Send an email to yourself (using a personal account not your business account), indicating the time you received the call, and what you told them to do.  If you have a good friend who understands what you're going through, copy them on the email.   If the person contacts NYL and cancels their policy, you will likely get a letter from their attorneys telling you how naughty you've been.   Having a time-stamped email with your version of events can be a critical piece of evidence.   About a year after I left, I had a woman contact me.  I gave her the 1-800 number, she called and in the course of the conversation, they asked her who she had spoken to about cancelling the policy, and she gave them my name.   This kicked off a nasty letter, but I was able to respond with my version of the events and I never heard another peep.    \n\nAfter this instance, I got a call from a person who was not one of my clients asking for service on his annuities.   I'm not making any accusations, but i had already had a number of back-and-forths with their legal department, and it seemed like he was trying to get me to say something that would put me in breach of contract.   I mean-- it could have been coincidental, but it was still strange that this guy called me out of the blue asking about options he had for an annuity policy that was coming out of surrender.... As soon as I identified that I wasn't a NYL rep and couldn't provide him service on that policy, but could provide him some information on other options that might be in his interest if he asked me to do so, he suddenly wanted to get off the line.   \n\nPlease note that AFTER you leave, they will assign your assets to another advisor, but it will take a few weeks for that advisor to get full access to the book.   Those first few weeks are critical for you to get your story out to those clients.   Why You Left.  When You Left.  How You Left.   It isn't uncommon for an agent succeeding a book at NYL to insinuate that you left under a dark cloud to try to sow distrust amongst the client base.   Get your story out first.  This could be a social media post, or perhaps word of mouth through clients with whom you speak.  I wouldn't do a mailing as this could be considered solicitation of business.   A timely FB post or LinkedIn Post saying \"Thank you\" to clients, COIs, etc. and make sure you spin the story that you're doing this in the best interest of your clients will go a long long way.   \n\n4.  Servicing -- You may not represent yourself to \"service\" policies.  NYL gets a case of the ass about that.   Also if your new B/D says that they have a \"relationship\" with NYL, that's usually the new B/D not knowing what they're talking about.  Don't expect to be able to service or get trails from VAs even after your 2 year non-solicit is over.   If a client calls you asking for a service document, you can inform them that many of those documents can be found on NYL's website and that they DON'T need to speak with a representative to get many of the forms.  NYL trains their clients to contact their agent (because it drums up more sales in the long term) -- by guiding them to the website and/or the 1-800 # you can help the client save time and energy meeting with an agent.\n\n5.  Income &amp; Cost of Business -- If you do stay in the industry, you'll be surprised to find out how expensive affiliation fees, tech fees, etc are.  NYL subsidizes those pretty heavily.  If you're staying in the business and moving to another B/D, make sure you stockpile funds to cover these costs until your revenue-generating assets move over --or negotitate that into your onboarding agreement.   At an independent B/D you can expect to pay up to $700 or more/month in tech/affilication/insurance costs.   \n\nAlso have them spell out what your monthly costs will be BEFORE you move so you don't get sticker shock.   For example, if you're on the advisory side and you have $15 million in Assets and you're an EC agent, let's say you're making 1%, and you have 55% GDC -- that means you're grossing $6875/month.   If you go to another BD and you're makign 1% and have 75% GDC, that's $9375/month.  Make sure you know the ADDITIONAL monthly/quarterly/annual costs.   Between tech fees, affiliation fees, you could be looking at $9500 annually, and then quarterly DST fees, you might be looking at another $700.  You'll also be getting paid under a 1099, so NYL won't be contributing to your SSI, so throw that on top of it.   Also -- CE is now \"on your own\".  You can get free CE credits here and there, but if you're taking a Kaplan course for your Insurance License, you're likely paying for it yourself.  \n\nOn the plus side, its uncommon for a BD to offer you a bonus of 20 or 30bp on all new assets brought over in the first year.  Also not uncommon to have a 2nd bonus out there for additional business, but ASK FOR IT.  If you are bringing over a substantial size book, you can also ask for free clerical support from the new B/D.  You may not get it -- but ASK for it.   Also -- Ask the new B/D to cover your re-registration fees for the year in which you move over.   And -- if you're bringing over a sizeable amount of assets, don't be afraid to ask them to waive some of your affiliation fees for the first few months.   They may not go for it, but you don't know until you ask.\n\nReally run the numbers for yourself, and don't be afraid to include your accountant on the decision.   Also be aware that unless you have a spouse who has coverage through their employer you'll likely have to purchase your own health insurance... which ain't cheap!  There's a cost to going independent, but in the long run no one is telling you what to sell, you're not forced to sit in monthly or quarterly \"rah rah go team\" meetings at the GO, and you don't have a partner asking you to take a noob under your wing and split commissions with them to \"get them started\".   Also note that you won't be getting advanced commissions for sale of life and annuity.  That's a tough pill to swallow, but get used to it.   \n\nSpeaking of annuities, Life Insurance and LTC, the comp structure is very different than NYL.   It isn't uncommon to get upwards of 7% on a VA (depending on age of annuitant and carrier of course), and commissions of 85% or 95% FYP on a life policy if you're independent.  Again -- you probably won't sell even 25% of the VA, LTC and Life that you do with NYL, but it is nice to have that additional comp for the work that's involved.      I think NYL caps at what...3.5% on annuities and 55% on FYP on life policies, but then they throw money into expense allowance account and your pension.\n\n6.   The Exit -- Do not.  Do NOT tell anyone you're leaving.  If you even hint that you're leaving to a manager or to someone in the general office, they are obligated to tell management, and you'll get terminated and cut-off from your email and your client files immediately.  Don't tell another agent what you're up to either.  There will be plenty of time to talk to them AFTER you leave.   If there's some service aspect for a client, IT CAN WAIT until after you leave.  If you care about the clients you're leaving behind, make sure you have a succession plan in place so that they don't get assigned to some shitbag.   But of course if you want to take the investment business with you, make sure the person you succeed the book to doesn't have their securities license (mwahahaha).\n\n  \n7.   Your Files -- NYL will tell you that all client information is now theirs.   They never made an effort to come after my paper files, so unless you were keeping paper files at the General Office, they likely won't ask for them.   If they \\*do\\* ask for them, you are under no obligation to deliver those files to them -- they have to come and get them.  You will need to make arrangements to return your keys etc to them, and any tech that you might have.  \n\n8.  Electronic Records -- Not a bad idea to run reports on SalesForce and/or download or print client policy information.   NYL will know that you've done this (they track this)-- and often this is a tip-off for them.   Of course if you're doing this WHILE working at NYL, they can't hold it over your head, but them seeing you downloading reams of data is a warning bell.   Not to be too paranoid here, and not saying that I did this, but I'd put any client information I downloaded onto a password protected external hard drive, and NOT on my laptop.   I'm just saying.  \n\nIf you have assets at DSTVision or NYLIFE Securities or Eagle, you'll want to download that information as well before you leave, and if you have any SIMPLE IRA or 401ks, make sure you have ALL the contact information for the plan administrator, the TPA, etc. etc.   as your VISION and NYLIFE Securities access will be obliterated within hours of your resignation.  \n\n9.   Registration at your new B/D -- If you decide to move to another B/D, be careful that you do NOT have them register to sell product or change your B/D PRIOR to leaving NYL.   The managing parter at our GO would get a report from corporate when any NYL employees were appointed to sell elsewhere.   One of the women we worked with did this prior to leaving and they knew she was headed out the door.   They'll also use this to flag your existing business -- so if you get appointed with TransAmerica or PacLife and all of a sudden there are a few policies in your book that get replaced by those carriers, they'll refer you to legal.\n\n10.   Family Business -- The non-solicit doesn't apply to family business.   If you plan on moving family business (siblings, parents, nieces, nephews, kids, wife etc), they can't come after you about that.   You can (if you choose) include those names in your letter of resignation.   More likely you should use when responding to nasty letters from their attorneys.\n\n11.  Responding to NYL Attorneys -- If they request a response, always respond.   Don't make the mistake of blowing off their letters or they'll use that against you if they decide to pursue you.  I would advise that you do so from a PERSONAL email account or using your home address, and NOT on letterhead or email through your new employer.  \n\n12.  Your Resignation Letter -- As indicated above when I spoke about your ledger -- make it short and to the point, and have it delivered at 8:00 AM.   Don't be an asshole in your letter -- be professional.   Your email access and portal access will be cut off immediately, so make sure you have everything you need (and make sure any subscription services you have or any personal email addresses you need etc are cleared off -- you might also want to change your NIPR and FINRA contact emails or BGA emails over to a personal account if you can).  If you have a conversation with a NYL employee AFTER you resign (the Managing Partner or the Compliance Manager or Development Manager) record the conversation if you can and/or document what was said.  This can be helpful in the future.\n\n13.  Your Pension -- NYL has a pension.  You are vested after 5 years.  Leaving at 4 years 11 months would be a terrible mistake (obviously).  Make sure when you leave that you have contact information for the pension benefits manager, and that your personal email address can be used to access the system.\n\n14.  The new BD -- Before you make the move, be sure to speak to someone who's done it.  Not all BDs have streamlined paperwork processes, and you'll have to learn new systems on your own.   Not a bad idea to ask \"show me the process for setting up new accounts\" and have them show your their electronic delivery platform etc.   Its going to be different, and likely more complicated depending on where you go -- but you'll figure it out.\n\n\n\n  \nWould love to hear others' experiences.",

Currently, I'm working under a mentor agent where I keep 100% of my NB commissions (6-10% of premium) and have a base salary of about $2000. The agreement is that any friends and family will transfer to my book when I launch, along with any other accounts that wish to have me as their agent moving forward. I have my P&amp;C license, and this will be my 3rd month as a producer. I've brought in over 35K in premium so far in auto/home only. I have to have two producers under me to open my agency in this program. I work leads that the mentor agent pays for, but that's only about 6 per day. The mentor agent even says not to waste time or money on leads since they don't pan out, and you'll burn yourself out. I would like to work more commercial accounts, but since I won't be able to take them with me, I feel that it wouldn't be in my best interest except to get some experience for my own agency. \n\nHere's my question:\n\nWhat does the typical take-home income look like for agency owners?

    "text": "NWM is a terrible place to work…. I’m embarrassed that I was ever affiliated with them… worked there for 6 months and want to warn all those thinking about taking the leap into that cesspool of a company.. Don’t do it! \n\nMy opinion is based on a 15 year career in sales, and having other 1099 positions to compare this place to.\n\nI’m Putting this post out there to hopefully persuade people not to join this company. I wish I did more due diligence before accepting a position there, but I guess all I can do is live and learn.. I was naive and confident that I would do well there.. that did not happen!\n\nInstead of writing a novel on the subject, I want to summarize my six month stint, and observations I made throughout that time.. as a prelude, I’m going to demonstrate why it’s a pyramid scheme.. although the company sells legitimate insurance products, their hiring, training, culture and compensation are set up to line the pockets of the people higher on the pyramid..\n\nThings I hated about the company…\n\nTRAINING- 1 month of being trained on how to reach out to your network.. no time at all spent on learning about the companies products.. Basically, reach out to everyone in your network with the message that you just joined NWM as a financial planner and want to see if there is an opportunity to help them… \n\nThe reason they do this is because they want to invest as little as possible into their new people’s education and industry knowledge, and just milk them immediately for their contacts.. the best case scenario is that these meetings result in someone having an actual life or disability insurance need.. if this is the case, you’re trained to pitch them on whole life insurance and try to convince them to buy in..\n\nMy take on the subject is as follows; whole life insurance is the optimal solution for very few, mainly the ultra wealthy.. term life insurance makes more sense for 99.9% of people and unfortunately you won’t make a living selling those policies. \n\nMANDATORY MEETINGS-\nNot sure if this is consistent across every office, but in my specific case, you had mandatory meetings on Monday and Friday mornings with the entire office.. \n\nthe mandatory meetings that I despised were the 2x a week meetings with an activity coach.. You would think that this “activity coach” would have experience in your role, but this wasn’t the case for me, and I’m pretty sure it’s not the case across the board.. these meetings consist of you telling that coach how many meetings you’ve set, what they’ve resulted in, and how does next week look.. they aren’t there to help you, they just want to push you to bombard your network harder… and do more “joint work” \nJoint work means bringing in a more senior person and if business is closed, you split that deal with them.. not only that, all future business done with this person will be split with that person as well..\n\nCULTURE &amp; KOOL AID-\nI’m not a kool aid drinker, I didn’t drink it while at the company… I do regret not spitting in it more than I did though..\n\nIf you decide to join the company, get familiar with the name Al Granum.. he is worshipped.\nIn a nutshell, he’s an insurance agent who worked at NWM in the 60s, and created a prospecting/activity system based on metrics.\n10 meetings result in 3 business opportunities, which should result in 1 new client..\nThe framework isn’t bad, but the way he is talked about and shoved down your throat is beyond annoying.. “If you do granum activity, you’ll succeed in the business”.. if you do granum activity with your warm network, you’ll quickly have very few friends :)\n\nAdditionally, there is an annual trip to Milwaukee where everyone at the company is pressured to attend.. it’s basically mandatory without the use of the word mandatory.. \nheres the kicker.. you have to pay for flight and accommodations out of your own pocket!!! Leadership tries to convince you that it’s a no brainer!! You’re investing in your knowledge and career!!! My employment was terminated before this trip took place, but I can assure you that I would’ve would been pressed hard to attend.\n\nLACK OF INVESTMENT IN EMPLOYEES-\nAs stated in the beginning of the post.. I’ve been employed as a 1099 in other industries and believe the following;\n\nIf you are an independent contractor, and don’t receive a base salary/benefits.. the company should invest in items that will enable you to do your job efficiently and effectively.. that’s the trade off I would expect. \n\nThis isn’t the case at NWM.. any software, whether it be LinkedIn Sales Navigator, or zoominfo, or anything else…. You have to pay for it out of your own pocket.. want to do business in a different state, you pay to get licensed in that state… \n\nI found it inequitable that NWM wants you to make rain and shove their products down your friends throats without at the very least providing you software that might help you automate some of this work..towards the end of my stint, I preferred cold calling and trying to \nSwindle strangers, because it was way more comfortable than trying to convince people I like and have a relationship with to buy the crap I’m peddling.\n\nMUTUAL TERMINATION-\nMy behavior towards the end of my time at NWM was not good.. I’ll be honest about that.. I was frustrated to the point that I wanted to poison the water while swimming out of there.. in the back of my mind, I knew what the result would be. NOW, here’s the interesting part of leaving the company.. after I was fired, I had to have an “off boarding meeting”.\nIn this meeting, they told me the amount of commission I’m owed, and the amount I owe the company.. this is how the conversation goes….\n\nSoo, you’re owed $3000 in commission from the deals you closed last month, and you owe $500 because someone cancelled their policy..\n\nIf you expect me to say that I was paid $2500, you’re wrong.. here is what they say instead..\n\nYou owe $500 to us immediately, and the $3000 you’re owed will be held in escrow for 13 months, and if none of those deals cancel before then, we will pay you in 13 months.. \n\nI could ramble for days about how bad my experience was at NWM, but my attention span prevents me from doing so.. \n\nIn conclusion… don’t work for this company.. \nyou can make a better living practically anywhere else..\n\nThat is all! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "What’s the best route for acquisition? I’m trying to help my father navigate this world because he’s looking to sell around May of next year. We’re located in Chicago suburbs. He wants to lessen the blow on selling cost such as working with an m&amp;a. My question is- what do you recommend? From what I’ve read we should be contacting agencies all around us asking if they’re interested. We’re also considering going to Gallagher/marsh mclellan to possibly get a “tuck in”. \n\nSome background: \nMy Father has a small agency that brings in roughly $350k in commissions annually. Mostly employee benefits with some commercial/personal p&amp;c. With an agency this size he is hoping to get at least 2x his book. Since this agency is his whole retirement plan I’m looking for some advice on how he can minimize selling cost and hopefully get a deal that pays him a salary for 2-3 years. ",
