Long days, nonstop stress, and I’m basically in survival mode most of the time.\n\nyesterday, I was doing quick pre-rounds, I went to check on one of my patients, an older Chinese woman with metastatic endometrial cancer. Cancer has spread to her bones and maybe her liver. We’re doing all the scans and workup, but realistically there’s not much that can be done.\n\nShe started speaking to me in Mandarin. I couldn’t understand her, but she looked like she really wanted to ask something. I usually go back after rounds for updates and conversations with pt and their families. And I still had more patients to see, so I was honestly kind of annoyed, but I called the interpreter line anyway. It takes a few minutes to get someone on, which feels like forever during pre rounds.\n\nFinally the interpreter came on, and I asked what she wanted to say. I must have sounded hurried and annoyed. I was expecting something about pain or her treatment. Instead, through the interpreter, she asked me,\n\n&gt;“Doctor, you’re already back. Were you able to get some rest? Did you eat before work? Are you doing okay?”\n\nI just stood there. This woman is dying, and she was worried about *me*.\n\nI felt awful for being irritated. Here I was, thinking she wanted to ask for something, but she just wanted to make sure I was doing alright. It hit me hard.\n\nI got so caught up doing tasks on a list. I forgot that I am treating people who also want human connections and regular conversations. I felt ashamed.",

It was unplanned but we figured hey, there’s going to have two of us so my wife can handle most of the childcare and I’ll step in more once I’m done with residency (I’m oversimplifying here). \n\nFlash forward to today. They’re barely a year old. She dies suddenly on a run after being hit by a teenager who was texting and driving, going 40 in a neighborhood. \n\nI’m a second year peds resident. I get, at most, one day off a week where I do nothing but sleep because the day before I’m on call for 24 hours (if I’m lucky but probably not). I work a week of nights once a month. \n\nI cannot take care of two babies and balance this schedule, and I sure as hell cannot pay for this much childcare for two people. I don’t know what to do. \n\nOur parents can’t help because they’re estranged and mine live in a different country. \n\nI want to drop but if I do I’ll be trapped in student loan debt for the rest of my life. \n\nI need help. Any advice appreciated. \n\nUPDATE: My solution as of now is for me to take an LOA while I get shit sorted. Maybe I’ll drop afterwards, maybe I won’t. I honestly don’t give two shits anymore. \n\nThank you to everyone who has offered advice. ",

    "text": "https://www.11alive.com/article/news/local/family-claims-atlanta-nurse-declared-brain-dead-kept-alive-pregnancy/85-eac5257d-a329-4dd7-b80f-5c0ecd30225a\n\n&gt; The family of a 30-year-old metro Atlanta mother and nurse said she was declared brain dead more than 90 days ago — but is still being kept alive because she’s pregnant.\nAdriana Smith, a registered nurse at Emory University Hospital, was nearly nine weeks pregnant in early February when she started experiencing intense headaches. \n\n&gt;According to her mother, April Newkirk, Smith sought treatment at Northside Hospital but was released after being given medication. Smith was declared brain dead. Her family has been by her side every day since, including her young son, who they said still believes his mother is just sleeping. She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk said. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.” \n\n&gt;Newkirk said doctors told the family the baby has fluid on the brain and they're not sure how much fluid. They're concerned about his health.“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk said. \n\n&gt;Under Georgia’s heartbeat law, abortion is banned once cardiac activity is detected — typically around six weeks into pregnancy.  The law includes limited exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger. But in Adriana’s case, the law created a legal gray area.\n \n&gt;Because she is brain dead — no longer considered at risk herself — her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability. The family said doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.\n\nNot mentioned in this article but she was 9 weeks pregnant when she died. Insane to me that apparently the only legal option to turn her into a zombie incubator for 6-7 months. ",

After I was done with my call, I checked my phone and saw her last text to me. I frantically looked for where she could've wandered to outside this late at night and calling out her name. When I came back inside, I saw she left her phone by the TV, took her gun and her ID with her. I called the police and friends, but it was already too late when they found her body. The past few days have been incredibly tragic and difficult. I remember her popping into my bedroom to use the bathroom for a second. Then, she disappeared forever, so fast. I can't believe that would've been the last moment I saw her. I wish there was something I could've done. I miss her so much. I've been studying sometimes and attending mandatory things in school, since it happened. Now whenever I'm at school, I feel so exposed when I'm there, because I couldn't hold back my tears.

She had been experiencing these symptoms for most of her life, which as you can imagine might be frustrating.  \n  \nWell, as I’m performing my physical exam I notice something peculiar - as far as I can tell, her testicles are missing. I couldn’t believe no one had picked up on this before.  \n  \nAt first I was thinking this could be a case of cryptorchidism. My attending and the rest of the team thought I was crazy, but I insisted. They finally agreed to ordered some imaging to see if we could find where those pesky little fellas were hiding out at.  \n  \nImaging came back with some very interesting findings. Her family jewels were missing altogether. This wasn’t just a case of the testes failing to descend. This was full on anorchia!  \n  \nThe absence of the storage organs for urine was causing the urine to constantly flow straight from the kidneys to the urethra - causing the total incontinence - and this constant flow combined with abnormal anatomy was irritating the lining of the urinary tract - causing the dysuria.  \n  \nI cannot stress enough how important it is to remember the basics. This poor woman could have been spared a lifetime of distress if only her previous care teams had remembered this one simple, foundational fact of medicine:  \n  \nPee is stored in the balls. ",

    "title": "My mom passed this morning at 5am. Thanksgiving is in two days. I'm stuck doing twelve-hour shifts in the emergency department, unable to go home for the holidays to grieve with my family. I've never felt more alone in my entire life.",
    "text": "A bunch of people from my school are going to immediately know who this is, but honestly, idc anymore.\n\nI moved to New York about 6 weeks ago, and I'm completing the last few rotations of my M4 year in various hospitals around the city. I intentionally set up my M4 year to be in New York, because I really liked the area, wish to match here, etc.\n\nI can't even go home. My family's on the other side of the country. I'm currently rotating through Emergency Medicine, and I'm at the hospital for 12 hour shifts and have to commute up to 3 hours a day. I'm in $400,000 of med school tuition debt that compounds at 6% interest a year and have spent my entire life in school. Applying to residencies right now just for the \\****opportunity***\\* to slave away for 120 hours a week for what's basically minimum wage.\n\nMedicine, at our level becoming physicians, is also such a no-BS field where you have to put your entire personal life on the backburner for 11+ years that it's depressing that I have to even be afraid to post this on Reddit on the chance a residency program (or someone at my hospital) can identify me through this information and see my grief/venting as a red flag - because why choose a doctor with family issues and risk factors for depression when we can take a completely happy-go-lucky resident who's never faced hardships before and has slightly higher board exam scores? Exactly - they don't. There's hypercompetitive residency programs that will even single out female applicants/doctors because of risk that they may plan to start families during residency or fellowship training - always big respect to my female colleagues for a field that's inherently not friendly to people who can't dedicate 11+ years to studying 24/7.\n\nI watch all of my friends from high school and college be in successful relationships and careers who are living out their early adult lives on facebook traveling the world and being happy, while I am forced to dig my nose into a book for over a decade of my life, all while I read Reddit threads, comments, comics, and posts that make front page about people loving shitting all over doctors nowadays. We've all gone from the heroes of COVID in 2021 to clowns that nobody respects anymore and blames for high healthcare costs - not the billionaire private equity groups and CEOs and multi-conglomerate trillion dollar insurance industry with its lobbying - no, it's doctors, of course. It's the medical equivalent of blaming the cashier of Starbucks for a latte being super expensive - I'm just the messenger. I'm not related to the gigantic, expensive private group of suits who own my hospital system and rake in millions to buy a 2nd yacht. Every layperson's an armchair doctor nowadays, too, using chatgpt and all.\n\nMy mom also passed away at 5am this morning, at the young age of 58 - grade III intraductal carcinoma, stage IV metastatic breast cancer with multiple internal organ failure. Tumor metastases in her lungs were compressing her respiratory tree and her pulmonary vasculature, with additional metastases to every segment of her cervical spine, thoracic spine, and more than half of her ribs. Septic shock, paraneoplastic SIADH, ARDs, liver, lungs, and kidneys failing. AST/ALT chronically elevated, hepatocellular mets causing damage. Ischemic myocardial damage indicated by elevated troponins on admission, nearly reaching cardiac arrest at multiple times during her ICU course with a resting HR of 140, in permanent SVT on EKG. BUN topped at 100, Cr at 3.0, trending steadily 2/2 fluid overload from lack of diuresis due to unstable pressures from sepsis. Intubated for 13 days, eventually needing maximal supplemental oxygen and respiratory paralytics, which didn't help at all. Limbs turned black and necrotic from being on vasopressors for shock for over two weeks - family has been grieving.\n\nA week ago was my dad and mom's 32nd anniversary. My dad brought balloons and flowers to my unconscious, intubated mom in the ICU. He picked special flowers from the park that my mom would bend over to pick up and smell just weeks prior, and set them by her nose, hoping she would be able to smell them while she was obtunded.\n\nAll of this, yet, I'm stuck. Up here. Halfheartedly trying to see people in the ED when I missed the death of my own mom back at home. It's so ironic - as a 4th-year student, I PAY 80-100k/yr to work for a hospital - for a rotation that I set up myself and had to pay for - for FREE, and I ***literally indirectly paid money to miss my mom's own death.***\n\nI have no friends, no family up here in New York. Just me. Every attempt to make a friend at a bar or club or somewhere out in public met with semi-cold shoulders or just transient connections that fizzle in ten minutes. I meekly try to search the MeetUp app for things to do to meet more people, but I remind myself, nobody wants to talk to someone who's going to dump a bunch of TMI trauma on them within 5 minutes of meeting. I'm someone who's great at using humor and cheerful friendliness to deflect feelings of grief or underlying sadness as a coping mechanism - I've always really identified with the idioms where class-clown-type-people are actually very chronically depressed on the inside. That's me. And it's coming crashing down all at once.\n\nIt's just so crazy. We all learn in our OSCEs about how to show empathy in a scripted way - ***\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, I truly am,\"*** bla bla bla. It's easy to show fake-empathy. I've never had someone so close to me pass like this, and I'm sure many others in this sub have had people pass in other, much more traumatic ways - but it's never hit me until now what it actually feels like to lose someone who's been there for your entire life. All the things my mom said she couldn't wait to do - ***\"Oh! If you ever have grandkids, I'm going to give them these old clothes of yours! If you get married, I can't wait to dance with whomever you end up marrying at your wedding!\"*** All of that, she won't be around to do or see. She won't see me graduate medical school in 5 months. I will never hear her talk or laugh again. Her last audible words to me were two weeks ago before her hospital admission, where I couldn't even tell what she was saying because she was coughing so much. Didn't get to tell her I loved her. Already regret all the times we bickered over small things that didn't matter in retrospect.\n\nAs a transplant to New York, I mean, obviously the sense of anonymity from starting fresh and feeling of independence that NYC in general gives people like me feels really freeing at first. You like it - you're your own person. I'd always wanted nothing more to experience it again ever since I visited for the first time a year ago.\n\nNow, I've never felt more alone.\n\nI will be spending Thanksgiving **alone.** I will be spending the entire week **alone.** The rest of the month and most of December, **alone.** The world will forget my mom - people will forget me. It's hard not to feel very unappreciated sometimes in medicine and that we're not doing anything to make a difference. I tried to take a basic history yesterday in a patient who came to the ED and almost got assaulted. Because I'm just \"*another dumbass doctor who doesn't listen to anyone.\"* I spent the rest of the evening after getting home tearing up into my bowl of Greek food from Greenpoint (an area in Brooklyn) that I bought to try and cheer myself up, even though I barely had time to shower and go straight to bed to get back up at 5am the following morning for my next shift.\n\nPeople always say other fields and people don't understand the sacrifices physicians have to make to get the training they need, and it's so true. Half of the reason I'm typing this is because I know all of you here can empathize. My school's policy is that we HAVE to finish EM by a certain date (late Jan/Feb), but I got this rotation via VSLO - it took six months to set up, and the rest of my academic year is already locked in. I have no other option but to finish this rotation - already talked to the preceptor and everything, who's been very kind and empathetic and helped move a few things around, but I just can't not finish this rotation - it'd mean deferring graduation, giving up all of my residency interviews and reapplying, paying another 80-100k next year, etc etc. It's not an option.\n\nTyping this, I can feel the tears flowing again now. It doesn't make it feel any better. All it's doing is making me cry even more.\n\nI'm just so damn sad.\n\nFuck.\n\nsigned, an M4 DO student. salutations to my fellow bone brothers and sisters 🦴",

I notice the classic white fingers and just make quick bathroom small talk - again, as one does.   \n  \n\"Got some Raynaud's, huh?\"  \n  \nThe 40 year old gentleman utters with a lovely portuguese accent: \"I'm sorry what?\"  \n  \n\"Oh...\" I realize I have started a conversation in the bathroom when I only meant to comment on a portion of his physical appearance. \"Its called Raynauds. Your fingers turn white when it is cold out, right?\"  \n  \nLearning that this has a name, he is now concerned. \"Yeah, this has always happened. Warming them up in the sink fixes it for some reason.\"  \n  \nWell shit. I am an M3 who is on their last clerkship. I know enough to know this is Reynauds, but not enough to say anything other than some nifty little science facts. Should I really be practicing medicine with a stranger in the 3rd floor bathroom of a campus rec center while I have poop on my middle finger?   \n  \n\"Yeah, it is caused by blood vessels constricting in the cold. It is usually benign, but definitely talk to your doctor about it for more info. Enjoy your workout!\"\n\nAlright, i'm safe. I rushed out of there probably quicker than I should have. My fingers don't smell so I am probably fine. OK, now to the exercise bike. I am 30 minutes into my Anki bike ride (Anki on the bike or treadmill is the only acceptable time to Anki, you \"sitting at a desk for 3 hours\" heathens). Guess who starts wandering over.\n\n\"Hey! What did you call it \\[the fingers\\]? I wanted to look it up.\" I confirm the name. He sits at the bike three down from me, on his phone I presume looking things up. \"Oh wow, i never realized this had a name! Looks like it can be associated with a lot of conditions, but you said it is normally benign?\"\n\nShit, he is on to me. \"Yeah, it is normally benign. There are some conditions it can be associated with in rare cases, but you seem healthy enough!\" Why did I say that? I don't know this man. He is 6'5\" with large muscles and looks like he exercises frequently. 'Healthy people don't have chronic illnesses' said the little gremlin in my head that convinced me to say he looks healthy. \n\nHe leans into the conversation: \"Yeah, I come to the gym 3-5 times a week for a few hours at a time. My dad, uncle, and grandpa all died in their 40s from some heart disease. I made sure to start working out in my 20s so I would be healthier.\"\n\nWell shit. I don't know about you, but when a medical student hears 'My parents and grandparents died young from an unknown condition but it was all the same way' you think bad thoughts. Do I drop it? Do I engage? What do I do? \"Oh that is unfortunate, I'm sorry to hear. Definitely something to bring up with your doctor.\"\n\n\"Why would I see my doctor if it is benign and I am doing what you are supposed to already? Haven't been to a doctor in years, this is all my own motivation.\"\n\nOh no, he is both gorgeous and stupid. I hesitate; \"Well there are some diseases like Raynaud's...like your fingers.....that can happen in other places in the body. It is super rare though so not likely, but definitely bring it up with your doctor.\" I am trying to get out of this conversation but encourage this man to see his doctor. \n\n10 minutes go by. He is still on his phone. He could be looking at anything though, its a good bike sesh. I get a card about Uterine Rupture incorrect; the UWorld image of the demon baby bursting through the uterus (you know the one) is taunting me when I hear a familiar voice. \n\n\"This sounds like it could be related to my family dying. Could it be?\"\n\nGoddamn it bro stop googling and go talk to your doctor. Sure, I am a seasoned November M3 at this point, but this is not the place. But I have already told him thrice to talk to his doctor. Ok, here we go. \"There is a possibility. While not always or even definitively linked, there is something called 'vasospastic angina' that has a very similar mechanism of action as the Raynaud's. Thankfully they both have the same treatment, **so i would talk to your doctor.**\"\n\n\"I've had like a few dozen times in the last few years where I just passed out after having some chest pain. Thought it was just reflux. So I should see a doctor about this? How do I do that?\" Excellent. I have converted this man to the ways of modern medicine. 'Passing out after chest pain' is a reason to go to the doctor more than anything.   \n  \nI reaffirm \"even rare things have to happen in someone....definitely reach out to your PCP. Like I said, easy treatment most of the time.\"  \n  \nFast forward to 2 weeks ago. I am on my bike again. I catch a glimpse of our guy strolling across the gym. \"Hey man!\" he shouts. \"I went to the doctor and you were right. Had to wear a heart monitor thing...\" blah blah he thanks me etc.   \n  \nI am happy to have convinced him. Turns out he likely has familial vasospastic angina, which is connected to global vasospastic disease in a minority of cases. His family is actively being evaluated as well. He started on nifedipine and his raynauds plus chest pains haven't happened since.   \n  \n\"Wanna come lift a set?\" he asks me.   \n  \n2 weeks on, I have gone lifting with this man 6 times. We will be riding a 100 miler next week after the polar vortex ends. We get along great. Potentially saved a life and gained a friend out of it.  I am delighted that poop finger bathroom small talk is in fact the place to make a diagnosis. \n\n",

    "title": "Had my first baby after the mother attempted an abortion at home due to my state’s abortion ban",
    "text": "I have been a NICU Respiratory Therapist for almost 10 years. In the largest NICU in my state. I have seen a lot of sad cases and infant death but I’m struggling quite a bit with this one. More than I have in a long time. My state like many others recently made abortion illegal with few exceptions. So I knew this day was going to come but nothing prepared me for just how bad this was. The baby had a severe case of a horrible extremely painful and gruesome fetal anomaly which I won’t say what it was. The anomaly isn’t always fatal so it doesn’t fall under one of the exceptions in the state for fatal anomalies. But with how horrible of an anomaly this was the mother tried to do the abortion at home. I don’t know much about the mother’s situation and I wouldn’t share anything if I did. But my state is at the very bottom in the country for access to prenatal care. So I would guess that she wasn’t made aware of the disease until late in the pregnancy. So when she attempted the abortion and had excessive blood loss and came to the maternity ED, the baby was far enough along we are required to resuscitate. \n\nEven though the baby was not wanted, I still had to resuscitate. I had to get an airway and secure it and again in my 10 years experience, this was the most grisly thing I have ever done. And for what, the baby didn’t even live to 24 hours old. It was horrifying. \n\nIt’s been weeks now and I can’t get it out of my head. Due to the abortion ban, I knew something like this would happen but never like this. My heart is broken for that mom. My heart is broken for that baby and how much pain it must have been in. But the biggest feeling I have is anger for all those people that voted for it. I have been talking about and showing google pictures of the disease to everyone I know so they too can know the gravity of what this abortion ban means. Even though there are exceptions in the law, it doesn’t matter because either our access is so low that women are not able to get abortions even when they are suppose to be allowed to or they have a technically not 100% fatal disease and so are not except. This is so inhumane, I don’t know how I’m going to carry on doing what I do. Is this going to be my new normal? I have always had to deal with patients that I thought to myself they should have been aborted. But the parents made the decision to try anyway. But for this baby NO ONE I mean NO ONE in that deliver room wanted this baby. Everyone in the room from the mom, the dad, to the neonatologist did not want to have this baby born and have to resuscitate but some law maker and the people that voted for it that are not even in the fucking room or in the same universe of understanding are forcing us to. Im sitting here sick to my stomach about what happened and for the future of what this means and I don’t know if I can carry on with this. ",

If you have anything, please share!\n\nEdit #2 (2/1/2025):\nSome people wanted more specifics and an ELI5.\n\n● ELI5:\nThe CDC used to have a bunch of data that scientists and doctors could look at to study diseases, like COVID-19, vaccines, and deaths. But recently, they removed or changed some of these datasets, making them harder to find or use.\n\nThink of it like a big library where people go to read books about health. Public health professionals could correlate data between these 'books' to study trends, look at patterns, etc. This can guide future studies, policy decisions, and lets people know what is currently going on with population health. \n\nFor me, a student, I used to be able to download datasets in basically a large spreadsheet. I could then use statical software, like SAS or R, to look at data trends, make graphs, find p-values, odd ratios, etc. And now I can't. \n\nThese are the datasets that were publicly or semi-publicly available. I don't think anyone knows what is happening with the non-public data that the CDC and health departments collect. \n\n\n\n● Specifics:\nSome examples of now missing datasets include (on mobile so hyperlinking these are hard, but they're a google away):\n\n• Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) CDC Data (website is down). BRFSS websites for some state websites are still up, but the data won't download.\n--- A nationwide survey that tracks health behaviors, chronic diseases, and preventive care use among adults.\n\n• Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) (gives a \"webpage not found error\")\n--- A survey that monitors health behaviors in high school students, including drug use, mental health, and sexual health.\n\n• Social Vulnerability Index (website is down)\n--- A tool used to identify communities most at risk from disasters, disease outbreaks, and other public health threats.\n\n• Environmental Justice Index (website is down)\n--- A dataset that helps measure how environmental hazards disproportionately impact different communities, especially marginalized populations.\n\n\n● Not datasets per se, but still valuable on a public health level that is going missing:\n\n• Atlas Plus Tool (website is down)\n--- A platform providing data on HIV, viral hepatitis, STDs, and tuberculosis, with detailed information on various demographics, including LGBTQ+ populations\n\n• Current STI Treatment Guidelines for medical providers\n--- A guideline that provided medical providers with up-to-date information on how to treat STIs.\n\n• Numerous LGBTQ+ related webpages on federal websites are being scrubbed. Too many to link.\n\nFinal Edit (2/1/2025):\nLink to the data is ready [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/s/k2OBgo7ypp)! \n\n\n\n",

    "text": "[https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/legal-news/appeals-court-upholds-landmark-75m-verdict-against-radiologist-er-doc](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/legal-news/appeals-court-upholds-landmark-75m-verdict-against-radiologist-er-doc)\n\nAn appeals court recently upheld a “landmark” $75 million verdict against a radiologist and emergency physician, plaintiff attorneys announced Tuesday. \n\nThe case dates back nearly a decade, to October 2015, when Jonathan Buckelew collapsed while receiving chiropractic care for his neck. He was transported to a hospital leading to a series of negligent events, *Radiology Business* reported [previously](http://radiologybusiness.com/topics/patient-care/75m-malpractice-verdict-splits-fault-between-er-doctor-radiologist).\n\nEmergency imaging showed Buckelew, 32 at the time, suffered a brainstem stroke—a diagnosis that should have prompted immediate treatment. However, his attorneys argued that the care team failed to reach a definitive diagnosis until the patient’s second day in the hospital. During the protracted wait, Buckelew’s brain was so severely damaged that he is now permanently stricken with “[locked-in syndrome](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/locked-in-syndrome/#:~:text=Locked%2Din%20syndrome%20is%20a,the%20movements%20of%20the%20eyes.),” rendering him unable to feel or control any voluntary muscle groups except those of his eyes.\n\nA jury sided with the man in 2022, awarding $46 million in civil damages and $29 million in medical expenses. About 60% of the sum was pinned on the EM physician, and 40% on the radiologist, while other clinicians were cleared. \n\n**Matthew Womack, MD, an emergency doc at North Fulton Hospital at the time, fought the decision.** But a Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the $40 million ruling against him on March 10. **Plaintiff attorneys believe this is the largest ER malpractice verdict in the state’s history.** \n\n“This decision is a victory not just for Jonathan Buckelew and his family, but for patient safety in Georgia,” Lloyd Bell, founding partner of [Bell Law Firm](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belllawfirm.com%2F&amp;esheet=54228022&amp;newsitemid=20250325615172&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bell+Law+Firm&amp;index=3&amp;md5=271bf87a7c29a641c2c592d0390104e2) and co-counsel in the case, said in a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250325615172/en/Georgia-Court-of-Appeals-Affirms-Record-Verdict-in-Locked-in-Syndrome-Case) shared March 25. “The court of appeals has made it clear that emergency room physicians must be held accountable when their actions—or inaction—lead to catastrophic harm.”\n\nBell Law emphasized that the ruling “upholds this verdict in full.” According to court [documents](http://belllawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/25-03-10-Opinion.pdf), radiologist James Waldschmidt, MD, also appealed but later filed a notice that Buckelew’s claims against him “had been resolved,” and he withdrew. \n\nWaldschmidt’s attorney had previously pointed the jury to evidence showing the radiologist read Buckelew’s imaging “with an eye to answering the specific question” of whether one of his arteries was torn. The attorney had compared a stroke to a forest fire.\n\n“\\[Waldschmidt’s\\] job is not to go down there and put \\[the fire\\] out,” the radiologist’s attorney said previously. “His job is to identify the smoke, and he did that.”\n\nA 10-year case. Since this was lost on appeal I assume this means bankruptcy and asset loss for the ER doc. Name dragged through the mud online. I wouldn't be surprised if he was experiencing SI. I know I would.\n\nWhat a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g clown world.\n\nGeorgia has no cap on non-economic damages. Think about that when picking a state to practice medicine in.",

    "text": "I’m still trying to process what happened.\n\nI’m a prelim IM intern, and yesterday I was on call covering 40 patients. One new admission came in for a UTI. According to the note, the patient’s son is an anesthesiology resident at another hospital. The nurse told me he wanted to speak with me. I figured it would be a straightforward conversation since he’s a fellow physician.\n\nThe moment I stepped into the room, though, he started aggressively pimping me. asking what organisms ceftriaxone covers, what organisms doxycycline covers, and the differences in empiric treatments for complicated vs. uncomplicated UTIs. My mind stalled for a second, and I found myself answering his questions before realizing I was caught in some kind of power trip.\n\nThen he asked me to list every single medication his parent received in the ED, down to the exact times they were given. It became clear he wasn’t trying to collaborate. he was trying to either embarrass me or assert dominance in front of his family.\n\nI eventually just said, “If you have any concerns, please let me know and I’ll share them with the team.” At that point, he switched to saying he thought ceftriaxone should be escalated to Zosyn. I told him I’d pass that along to the team.\n\nThe way he was pimping was so unnecessarily aggressive that I’m still unsettled by it. Honestly, I just feel bad for the junior residents in his own program. ",

    "text": "To all fourth-year medical students preparing your rank lists,\n\nAs a current Internal Medicine resident at the University at Buffalo (UB), I feel it’s important to share some hard-earned lessons about my experience here. If you’ve been following UB’s residency programs, you might recall that we unionized and even went on strike back in September to fight for fair treatment and wages. After more than a year of tense negotiations, we finally ratified a contract in December that included salary increases and a $2,000 educational stipend. At the time, it felt like we had made real progress.\n\nHowever, shortly after we signed the contract, GME abruptly stripped all programmatic and wellness funds from every residency program at UB. Historically, these funds were used to support things like lunches during didactics, wellness programming, and even our graduation ceremonies, which were entirely covered in the past. This decision has gutted many aspects of our programs that contributed to resident well-being.\n\nEven more disheartening, it appears GME’s intention all along was to repackage the old programmatic funds into the “new” stipend as a way to placate us. To make matters worse, they’re claiming we’re not eligible for the full stipend this year because the contract was signed mid-academic year. Too bad we couldn’t trust GME to be decent people—this feels like a calculated move to punish residents for standing up for ourselves.\n\nIt’s gotten so bad that someone even started a GoFundMe to help cover what GME took away. Imagine having to crowdfund wellness for residents at an institution like this.\n\nI want to be honest with those of you considering UB for residency: this is not an institution that supports or values its residents. The wellness and professional development resources we once had are gone, and the culture here has become one of disillusionment and distrust.\n\nFor those finalizing your rank lists, I urge you to think carefully before applying to or ranking UB. There are many programs out there that genuinely prioritize the well-being and development of their residents. Learn from my experience and weigh your options carefully.\n\nI share this not out of bitterness, but as a word of caution from someone who’s been through it. I hope it helps you make the best decision for your future.",

    "text": "Since many asked for an update I was reinstated! Here is a guide for any future students etc. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/s/dAiEU34sOR\n\n^ MY GUIDE ON APPEALING AND DISMISSALS BTW\n\nI first and foremost want to thank all of you on Reddit for giving me your advice when i hit rock bottom. the people who DM me, who messaged me, and who have commented on my post a few months ago thank you 🙏 \n\nEven now, my DMS are still flooded with people going through something very similar and facing dismissals. Many have reached out asking the same question so I’m just gonna put everything on this post to help anyone down the line. Hopefully no one needs this.\n\n\n1. Why were you dismissed?\n\nWithout going into details and to keep it vague, I was dismissed for being in bad standing when I actually was not and had written documentation. \n\n2. Did you appeal?\n\nYes, I did two rounds of appealing internally. My school has three campuses. And I was denied on both of my appeals and they gave me BS answer citing the handbook as their reason. And on my last appeal, the dean said that the decision was firm. \n\n3. Why get a lawyer? \n\nSo I was at a crossroad- either take this dismissal and never be a doctor in the USA again or fight for myself and lawyer up. So I hired an attorney to save my career. There was absolutely no way any medical school would accept me if I reapplied with a dismissal on my transcript. On top of that, I actually have multiple written proofs of my claims.\n\n4. What kind of lawyer? \n\nYou have to get a lawyer who is aware of the education system, which are education attorneys/ student defense attorney/ medical school dismissal attorneys. And no, they don’t have to be in your state or your medical school state.\n\nIf you Google it, you will see some pop-up.\n\nFind two attorneys that you like pay the consultation fee. Have that one hour conversation tell him everything that happened and ask them what they can do for you? Do you have a fighting chance? What are your options?\nAnd have they worked with medical students before?\n\n5. How much did it cost? \n\n$14,000 for MY case which was NOT litigation or a lawsuit. \n\nand I also paid around $1000 in total for consultation fees from other lawyers. \n\nAnd I want to emphasize this is a fuck ton of money absolutely. I am broke. did take out another credit card for this. However, I have absolutely have no regrets.\n\n6. How long did it take? \n\nIt took around two months of back-and-forth for me to be reinstated. I do want to emphasize that every law firm is different, and every school is different for my own research. It can take anywhere from a couple weeks to around 5 to 6 months to get a resolution.\n\nIt all depends on your school how they respond and how fast your attorneys respond. \n\n7. Was it worth it?\n\nAbsolutely. I’ve had people tell me not to get an attorney and to reapply or go to the Caribbean. My transcript is saved. My entire career is saved, and I can graduate with my MD.\n\nBut the second a medical school sees that you have an attorney they will take you seriously. It’s incredibly fucked up that this is how schools are, but the day my attorney started being mean to the school and threatening them with accreditation violations and potential lawsuit there was a resolution offer within a week. \n\nI can’t make the choice for y’all, but I worked hard to get into medical school. I declined other medical school acceptances for the school that I chose. And I knew that there was absolutely no way I would ever be a physician with a dismissal on my transcript unless I was gonna go Caribbean etc. \n\nRegardless of what you’re going through fight for yourself. Stand up for yourself. And exhaust all options because your entire future is on the line. I hope this helps someone because know that you’re not alone in our medical school system is just shitty.\n\n\nEdit: IF IT WAS NOT CLEAR THIS IS FOR USA MED SCHOOLS!! I’m not well versed or sure how programs in Europe/ Australia work im sorry 😢\n\n",

They refuse to acknowledge that I’m a doctor/resident and refer to me exclusively as “the learner.” I share a workroom with them and get to spend all day listening to them talk about how they’re better off when the attendings don’t “interfere” with how they practice medicine and whatnot.\n\nToday, a high-acuity patient came in, and I signed up for the case. I was immediately told by the NP that “as the learner,” I’m not allowed to take care of patients like that. This NP is probably ~10 years younger than me, with a bachelor’s degree and an online NP program under her belt. Meanwhile, my first job in medicine was 16 years ago. I have a master’s, PhD, MD, and a year of residency completed…but apparently I’m not nearly as qualified to manage patients as an NP??? I hate it here. ",

    "title": "Stop Glorifying Academics",
    "text": "**Disclaimer:** If your dream is to match into a competitive fellowship and become a niche subspecialist, lecture in grand rounds, publish until your name is a PubMed footnote, and win the holy trinity of teaching awards, by all means, aim for a strong academic program. This is not for you. This is for the 95% of future physicians who will not become career academics, despite what their deans, mentors, and inner monologues keep whispering.\n\nI graduated from a so-called “top” MD school. I rotated through Harvard hospitals, dined at lavish departmental dinners at national conferences, nodded reverently in the clinics of the greats, and ghostwrote more book chapters and manuscripts than anyone should admit. I don't list these as accolades but as branding marks. I have the CV of someone who was supposed to be seduced by the ivory tower. And yet, I didn’t rank a single academic program highly. I’ll never go back.\n\nBecause academic medicine, despite its pressed white coats and awards dinners, is a scam.\n\nWhy do so many M4s chase academic residencies? I suspect it's the same old disease: the need to keep climbing. You wanted Harvard for undergrad. Then for med school. Why not for residency, too? But here’s the part no one says out loud: being a student at Harvard is not the same as being an employee at Harvard. The latter is far more Sisyphean and considerably less romantic.\n\nI have seen the insides of these towers, and what I found wasn’t prestige or excellence or even much mentorship. It was scaffolding: hollow, gleaming, soulless. You sell your time, your weekends, your sense of self, all for a line on your CV no one reads past the first interview.\n\nLet’s be honest. If someone studied academic attendings, especially those in the upper reaches of Chairdom, I’d bet good money the DSM would be heavily referenced. As a student, the “dedicated teachers” pimped us, gave us no autonomy, and called it “training.” Their standards of perfection aren’t about medicine. They’re about themselves. Residency isn’t about becoming a good doctor; it’s about shaping you into a loyal foot soldier in the endless war of subspecialization.\n\nAs a medical student, you’ll do the grunt work: data entry disguised as research, CV-padding with someone else’s name first. As a resident, the pressure only builds. Publish, present, promise mentorship to the next crop of wide-eyed students. Some will fall for it. Some won’t match. And some will do a “research year,” only to not match again, like a Kafka novel with scrubs.\n\nYou’ll hear administrators, those without MDs or DOs or much empathy, whispering ugly things about struggling residents or students. You’ll watch attendings laugh along. You’ll be told you’re “not academic enough,” when what they mean is: you're not useful enough for their branding.\n\nAnd if you survive the gauntlet into fellowship and finally become an attending, congratulations. You’ll now earn less than your community hospital peers to spend your “free” time grading student presentations, fighting for funding, and flying to conferences you can’t afford to miss. All so you can stay relevant in a system that never cared about you.\n\nWhat should you pursue instead?\n\nA program with good people. A place that lets you grow as a doctor and stay human. You’ll find those places, quietly, without brochures, mostly in community hospitals, the unsexy kind, where nobody cares if you trained at Mass General and everyone cares if you show up for your patients.\n\nI remember hearing these warnings years ago before medical school: how I’d be used for research scut, chewed up, and discarded. But I didn’t believe them. I was a poor kid with something to prove. I thought prestige was the antidote to shame.\n\nThe joke, of course, is that the people telling me the truth wore the same tired scrubs I do now.\n\nI'd love to discuss, and understand I may invite some sour academics who hate what I told the \"impressionable students\" about their game.

    "text": "In the last seven months, the Medical Council of Canada has seen a 750% increase in the number of Americans creating accounts on its site to initiate the licensure process, NPR reported May 29.\n\nThe number of American physicians seeking to move to Canada to practice has ebbed and flowed for decades, usually in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but it has never been this high, experts told NPR.\n\nHere are five things to know:\n\n1. The first step in becoming licensed in Canada is to create an account on physiciansapply.ca. In the past seven months, 615 physicians have created accounts, compared to 71 applicants during the same time last year. In recent years, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations and expedited licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.\n\n2. Both medical licensing organizations and companies that recruit physicians into Canada reported many physicians citing the Trump administration as their primary reason for moving.\n\n3. The Trump administration declined to comment on the trend when asked by NPR, but did ask if the news outlet knew the number of physicians and their citizenship status. The news outlet did not provide or have this information.\n\n4. Some recruiting companies reported a 65% increase in the number of American physicians looking for Canadian jobs between January and April. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario said it received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained physicians — and registered 116 of them — in the first quarter of 2025. British Columbia, another province, said it licensed 28 U.S.-trained physicians in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.\n\n5. Rural communities in Canada launched an advertising campaign after President Trump’s election to recruit American physicians. The campaign focuses on physicians in Florida and North and South Dakota. Its key selling point: “zero political interference in physician patient relationship.”\n\nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/hospital-physician-relationships/us-physicians-seeking-canadian-licensure-up-750-in-7-months-5-notes",

    "text": "I came to the US from my home country in the EU for residency after finishing intern year back home about ten years ago. I was excited to be where real innovative medicine was practiced and doctors were well-paid, and didn't have strong feelings one way or the other about private insurance (back home it is socialized healthcare). Over the past few years as an attending though I have been increasingly haunted by the feeling that I am profiting from blood money, even though I deliberately chose to work at a state hospital that provides care to uninsured patients we are still billing and bankrupting them. I scaled up my free clinic hours, my husband and I donate to M4A advocacy groups, I am not sure what more I can do. I tried waiving my copay for patients in my clinic who indicated it was a barrier. But, my chairman somehow found out about this and was LIVID, he just came in and shouted at me \"do you have any idea how much trouble this could get the whole department in\" and \"how could you possibly think this was an OK thing to do?\" I just broke down crying because, who is it hurting? It only comes out of my compensation, and made me feel like I was making a system that feels like a sea of sh!t just a tiny bit more human.  \n\nSomething else I have noticed is that Americans are sooooo sick. I did med school and internship in one of Europe's top teaching hospitals which handles the most medically and socially complex patients. The sickest patient I ever saw would be just a regular patient in America. You get young patients presenting with diseases in advanced stages that basically only exist in textbooks in my country, for example kids in their 20s with no kidneys anymore because of being unable to treat T1DM.\n\nAm I the only one to feel this way? I have been really contemplating moving back. Attendings make just above $100k, which is considered a very good salary in my country, I am just worried about whether my husband could take that adjustment psychologically as he is procedural and currently makes a lot more--he is American and when I have talked to him about it, his solutions basically amount to vote for Bernie Sanders. \n\n",

    "text": "Hi. First time posting but after going through a difficult time I received some comfort on these threads so I thought I would contribute. Maybe my story could help someone else going through a rough time.\n\n  \nI am a general surgery residency grad. Had a great residency, started a beautiful family while in residency and got the fellowship of my dreams (so I thought). Life was good. 2 months into my fellowship I started to struggle. I think I was much more burnt out from residency than I had realized without any time to recover but I was pushing through. I was feeling extremely overworked, disrespected and not growing as a surgeon in this particular program. \n\nI don't talk much to my wife about work. I enjoy hearing more about her day at work (works from home) and how her and the kids are doing but on this particular day I shared with her my struggles. She then confessed that she was getting pretty miserable working, taking care of the kids, being pregnant and most of all, feeling like I was never around. After hearing this and coupled with some other family issues I lost every ounce of fire I had that carried me through residency and fellowship training to that point. I was done. I decided I was going to resign, take a break and start my career as a general surgeon. \n\nIt took me almost another month to get the courage to talk to my PD. I have never quit anything before. I felt like a failure. I also was bothered by the call burden I would be placing on my co-fellows very much. I replayed the scenario in my head over and over imagining how bad the conversation was going to go. But when I finally had the talk with my PD he was very understanding. He could tell I was going through it. So we made a plan for my exit. I talked to my co-fellows about the situation and apologized. Im staying on for another month to help with call while they figure out my replacement and their next move but after that I am gone. It feels like a weight has been lifted off my shoulders and I am excited to start my career as a general surgeon. \n\nIt was probably the hardest decision I have ever made but I know it was the right one. Life is too short to be miserable when you don't have to. My family has already sacrificed enough. I couldn't live with myself making them miserable for another 2 years. If you are thinking about leaving just know it is going to be ok. Talk to mentors about the decision (I did a lot). Make a plan. Be professional. This stuff happens. You are still a doctor, husband/wife, Dad/mom, bother/sister to somebody at the end of the day and that is great. ",

Rolling my eyes at consults that felt lazy. Laughing along with other specialists about how emerge is just glorified triage. How they call for the stupidest shit. How they punt. How they don’t think.\n\nBut I had a moment tonight that I feel embarrassed even admitting.\n\nI realized I’m the fool.\n\nI’ve spent years getting irritated at what I thought was incompetence, when really I’ve just been blind to how structurally opposed our incentives are. I want them to do more; assess thoroughly, initiate treatment, tidy up the mess so my clinic stays clean. So I don’t get woken up at 3am when I have to work regardless the next day. \n\nBut they’re under relentless pressure to move people. The hospital isn’t judged on the quality of the primary assessment. It’s judged on time to bed, time to disposition, minutes to triage. They’re trying to stay afloat in a system that punishes them for doing too much and rewards them for offloading.\n\nAnd here I am, acting like their priorities should match mine. Like they’re just bad at their jobs, instead of crushed under an entirely different set of expectations.\n\nIt hit me that if emerge did everything the way I wanted, they’d clog up worse than ever. There aren’t enough staff. There isn’t enough space. Every minute they spend thinking deeply about a case is a minute someone else waits in a hallway. So of course they defer. Of course they cut corners. It’s not laziness. It’s survival.\n\nThe real problem, again, like always, isn’t each other. It’s the system. It’s the horrific, machine we’re all trapped inside, where throughput wins over thought, and deferral is built into the architecture. And the worst part is, we all know it. But we still act like it’s each other’s fault.\n\nBut it’s not just a nameless machine. It has a face. It’s the administrators shoveling quality metrics down our throats, who haven’t spent a single minute talking to a real patient in their entire miserable lives. Who make rules about our work without understanding its substance. Who treat “efficiency” like it’s the same thing as care.\n\nI don’t know what to do with this realization yet. But I know it’s changed how I see things. I know I’m not going to laugh so easily next time.\n\nEdit: yes I was an asshole. Probably still am. Will try to be less of one.",

    "title": "U.S.-Trained Doctors, Suddenly Unallowed to Work",
    "text": "Many of you have heard the phrase “travel ban” and assumed it only affects people trying to enter the United States. Since 2017, that was largely true. You would occasionally see stories about residents unable to start training because a visa was delayed or a ban blocked entry. But earlier this month, under the current administration, the scope shifted. What is happening now is different, and unprecedented in how far it reaches.\n\nThis has expanded beyond the border and is now impacting legal immigrant physicians already living and working inside the U.S. These are not new arrivals. These are physicians who have been here for 7 to 15 years, trained in the U.S., and built their lives here, not because of anything in their individual history, but solely because of their country of birth. For many international graduates, the path from intern year to a green card takes close to a decade, often longer with fellowship.\n\nMany of these doctors completed U.S. residency and fellowship, served in underserved communities under waiver obligations, and worked through COVID in ICUs, nights, weekends, and holidays. They followed the legal pathways: waivers, approved employment-based green card petitions, including cases deemed in the national interest, and routine work authorization renewals while their green card cases remain pending.\n\nNow those pathways are being placed on indefinite hold.\n\nGreen card processing, visa renewals, and work permits, the basic administrative steps required to keep showing up to work, are being placed on indefinite hold with no clear timeline and no meaningful guidance. People who have lived here for a decade are being pushed into quiet, indefinite limbo.\n\nThis is not theoretical. I personally know multiple physicians affected.\n\nI know nine colleagues, including a cardiologist, a critical care physician, and a plastic surgeon, who are months away from losing their ability to work solely because their pending green card work permits are not being adjudicated or renewed. They also cannot travel because re-entry is effectively impossible under current entry restrictions. I know an internist at a major institution who has already been forced off work for three months, despite multiple prior work permits and doing everything by the book. I know a friend recruited to become the first pediatric subspecialist in an underserved rural area whose contract negotiations stalled, not due to need or qualifications, but because the hospital cannot take the risk of hiring someone whose authorization could be arbitrarily frozen.\n\nThe human side is hard to describe unless you have lived it.\n\nOur profession demands certainty and accountability. We cannot practice medicine with “maybe.” Patients do not get to pause heart failure, STEMI, septic shock, or an airway emergency until bureaucracy feels ready. Our duties demand that we be present, calm, precise, and deeply empathetic. Many of us perform life-saving procedures and make high-stakes decisions that require focus and emotional stability.\n\nAnd yet we are being asked to do all of that while our own lives are held in suspense.\n\nImagine walking into the ICU to treat someone else’s crisis while not knowing whether you will be allowed to keep working next month. Imagine trying to reassure families and plan discharges while you cannot plan your own children’s schooling, your mortgage, your lease, or even whether you will still have an income. Imagine being placed in limbo indefinitely, not because of anything you did, but because of where you were born.\n\nIt is not just stressful. It is degrading. It feels like being denied basic dignity.\n\nI am not posting this for pity. I am posting because this is a patient-care and workforce issue, and it is happening quietly. Its been only 2 weeks since the expansion to include legal immigrant inside the US. Hospitals will feel this. Patients will feel this. Underserved areas will feel it first.\n\nIf you can help, please do.\n\nIf you have connections to medical societies, hospital leadership, government affairs offices, journalists, advocacy groups, or lawmakers, raise this issue. Ask them to look into the impact of this broad freeze on legal immigrant physicians already practicing in the U.S. Push for transparency, timelines, and a process that does not destroy careers and patient access by default.\n\nWe understand the need for security vetting and sensible reform. But blanket sweeps without precision create predictable collateral damage. Many of the physicians I know with approved green card petitions and waiting final step are not even asking for the green card to be issued immediately. They are simply asking for the ability to keep working through a stable, lawful immigration pathway. Placing work permits on hold and pushing long-term physicians, their families, and their patients into indefinite limbo should not be an acceptable outcome, especially when training each physician in the U.S. costs taxpayers roughly $750,000 to $2 million.\n\nEven sharing this helps. This is already happening, its been two weeks and it will get worse unless people speak up and advocate.",

    "text": "I was never an angry person. Ever. But how can you not be furious when you’ve spent over a decade of your life dedicated to medicine, only to be hated by the general public. And you realize your years of training and medical knowledge carry zero weight compared to the words of a podcaster or influencer pushing the latest alternative medicine BS. \n\nMeanwhile, you’re working 60+ hours a week for less than minimum wage. At my hospital, they pay midlevels **still in training** more than residents (make it make sense!!!). And we get gaslit every single day with, “This is a calling, it’s a sacrifice,” and told that we must work these insane hours for years in order to be competent and safe to treat patients… but somehow, an NP with an online degree is allowed to work the same job as us with 1/10th the training.\n\nMy program preaches “evidence-based medicine,” yet somehow all the evidence on the importance of sleep, diet, exercise (the very things we tell our patients to prioritize) are completely disregarded for us. The hospital gives you an Uber home after a long shift, which is basically admitting you're unsafe to drive, but apparently not too tired/unsafe to care for critically ill people?\n\nAnd then, the longer you stay in medicine, the more you realize the best, kindest, most amazing patients often die miserably. And the mean, abusive, alcoholic jerk somehow lives forever and has perfect labs despite everything. There’s no justice. \n",

    "text": "With July coming up, lots of nurses are posting about how often they have to save patients from physicians, especially residents, and especially interns. \n\nIn my time as a resident, I've definitely had nurses alert me to a lab or vital I may have missed that or question an order that I realized is a mistake. But I swear 95% of the time they've questioned an order, they're usually telling me something I already know and considered before giving the order, or something I don't care about in relation to the order. If I do change the order it's more often to make the nurse feel better rather than any sort of change in my medical decision making. \n\nI do appreciate nurses for double checking orders and I'm sure I will make major mistakes in the future that will be caught by a nurse, but overall it's a rare instance. I know in nursing school they're basically taught it's their job to save patients from physicians, but this mentality is killing the confidence of residents and worsening the relationship between nursing and medicine.

    "title": "Fraud, Controversy, and Debauchery - Cedars Sinai",
    "text": "I am Internal Medicine resident at **Cedars-Sinai;** I just became an **R3. I inherited this account from my mentor and like them I** have my regrets with coming to Cedars.\n\nAt the start of my intern year, a Reddit post claimed Cedars was unsupportive of residents and their mental health. I vividly remember thinking it had to be a joke, because, compared with my East Coast friends, residency **seemed so much better here.** Yet no one talks about how the “superficial” culture of Beverly Hills permeates downward from the Program Director.\n\n**Plain and simple:** Cedars-Sinai is a privately owned community hospital that “entertains” having residency programs and prostrates itself as an academic institution. Program Directors like pretending it’s an academic institution, but our emails are still “.org” instead of “.edu,” and, depending on the specialty - research opportunities are sparse. Realistically, the hospital serves private patients and private attendings – hence why PDs have little to no influence when advocating for their programs and are subject to whatever the hospital executives decide. Even now, residents lack a proper workspace.\n\nComing from an East Coast academic hospital, the biggest transition was dealing with private attendings. For example, in the ICU or on wards, when you need a Derm or Ophtho consult for a peculiar rash or candidemia, private attendings will actively try to block the consult despite it being medically indicated. Actually Absurd.\n\n**The worst issue is dealing with fraudulent or lackadaisical private attendings:**\n\n·       **Dr. Youram Nassir** \\- committed **$3 million** in Medicare fraud and still treats most of the cancer patients on our wards list. He never responds to messages or pages; at best, you hear back from one of his NPs who has never seen the patient in question. How such an individual is allowed at a “teaching hospital” reinforces that Cedars values only its bottom line. Details of the case can be found here: [https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/mid-wilshire-cancer-doctor-and-his-medical-office-agree-pay-over-3-million-settle](https://www.justice.gov/usao-cdca/pr/mid-wilshire-cancer-doctor-and-his-medical-office-agree-pay-over-3-million-settle)\n\n·       **Dr. Payam Shadi** \\- notorious for mismanaging patients. He skips proper med-recs, neglects major issues, and a large number of his patients end up in the MICU (to the point where MICU attendings ask him to leave). His patients are nicknamed “Shadi patients” because of his poor management. Despite countless complaints, he retains full privileges because he sees so many patients and brings in revenue.\n\n·       **Dr. Omar Tirmizi** \\- another private hospitalist infamous for poor patient care. He was recently fired by a patient yet continued dropping notes and billing without seeing them; the patient went a week without a primary MD. An administrative hearing produced no consequences.\n\n·       **Dr. Ramin Gabbai** \\- a nephrologist who always asks, “What year are you?” and refuses to speak to anyone who is not the senior or attending. A medical student once consulted him and was yelled at while he reminded her that he trained at Harvard (Beth Israel). This is normal here; nothing is ever done.\n\n·       **Dr. Noah Marin and NP Jose (“Joey”) Causin** \\- on the bone-marrow transplant service, NPs are notorious for mismanaging patients, and the overnight/weekend resident gets blamed. Their patients frequently end up in the MICU. Dr. Marin is infamous for berating residents and patients alike. Despite program awareness, no changes have been made.\n\nTalk to any IM resident at an actual academic hospital: wards is where trainees learn the most and their mettle is tested. Cedars is different. A wards team consists of two seniors, two interns, and one to two medical students. The list is split evenly between interns, and, at any time, at least six patients are discharge or social-work issues. You have only three medically active patients to learn from while spending the rest of your time with case management and social work. More than half the list at any given time are “rocks.”\n\nAdmin “attempted” to help by transferring the “rocks” to private groups, but because those patients are uninsured or on Medi-Cal, they must stay on the teaching service, the only service at Cedars that treats low-income patients. Even so, most of our census is filled with patients who are medically inactive and simply awaiting placement.\n\nEvery year, the ACGME issues surveys to residents about their programs. Cedars’ PD and APDs hold mandatory sessions to “guide” residents on how to respond “appropriately” - a practice difficult not to call unethical.\n\n**Over the past year, three IM attendings left and one department head stepped down:**\n\n·       **Dr. Paul Noble** \\- IM department chair for a decade - steps down this year after his wife, Dr. Anna Noble, got a DUI. Dr. Paul Noble was arrested during the incident for being unruly. Dr. Anna Noble still directs Saban Clinic, where many residents rotate. Details here: [https://www2.mbc.ca.gov/BreezePDL/document.aspx?path=%5cDIDOCS%5c20230515%5cDMRAAAJD2%5c&amp;did=AAAJD230515161047159.DID](https://www2.mbc.ca.gov/BreezePDL/document.aspx?path=%5cDIDOCS%5c20230515%5cDMRAAAJD2%5c&amp;did=AAAJD230515161047159.DID)\n\n·       **Dr. Catherine Cardoza** \\- one of my favorite attendings, compassionate and caring. Fresh out of residency, she had a habit of staying up late chart-checking patients and messaging overnight residents with care suggestions. Co-residents complained until she suddenly quit. The program never explained; she was simply removed from the schedule. She was goated.\n\n·       **Dr. Nicole Van Groningen** \\- a TikTok doctor who left Cedars. I’ll never forget her being 20 minutes late to rounds because she was “making a TikTok.” Look up her reviews online.\n\n·       **Dr. Jonathan Duong** \\- appointed associate program director last year; now, a year later and some change later, he’s gone. Cedars lures physicians from reputable institutions with promises of titles and salaries, only for them to realize it doesn’t compare to real academic centers. Dr. Duong came from UCSF and has returned to the Bay Area.\n\nFinally, I can’t stand how many co-interns and seniors do drugs. Maybe it’s LA, maybe it’s because Cedars doesn’t drug-test residents, but countless residents take molly, shrooms, marijuana, snort Xanax, or regularly use Adderall. At our recent retreat, I’d never seen so many drugs in one place. The admin seemed aware, said nothing, and simply handed out Zofran the next day.\n\nThis isn’t just airing dirty laundry; it’s a plea for real change and accountability. Enough is enough.\n\nEdit (7/17/2025):\n\nAn ex Cedars employee messaged this to me instead of posting because of lack of Comment Karma:\n\n\"The fraud and debauchery are unparalleled. Its a very admin run hospital- admin bean counters are in bed with privates. This means that academic programs are looked at as afterthoughts/ secondary. Patients come thinking they will get superior world class care. Most of them (with ppo insurance) get shuttled to privates and get substandard care. Most division/department chiefs are research/admin and not clinical. Hence they dont completely know the ground reality, or choose to ignore it so that they can keep their million dollar jobs. Again this gets at how admin heavy the hospital is.\n\n1. The director of artificial intelligence and imaging - **Guido Germano** was arrested a few years ago for downloading/uploading child pornographic images! **Gary Goulin**, ex-pediatric intensivist, was also sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for distributing child pornography.\n2. The director of cardiac imaging- **Robert Siegel** is not allowed to see female patients by himself due to complaints that were made about harassing female patients.\n3. **Jeff Toll** settled a lawsuit with LA County for fraudulent billing worth millions of dollars during the Covid pandemic . It was all over the Internet . He used to attend on the inpatient Housestaff service.\n4. Wasn't Anna Noble Paul Noble's fellow at one point in time? Heard rumors that they had been having an affair during her fellowship. This is very common at Cedars- for example the director of heart Institute would commonly go on dates with post doc students of his senior colleagues.\n5. **Barry Brock**\\- we all knew him as being verbally inappropriate at times. But never realized that he was a monster behind the scenes. Litigation is ongoing right now. \"",

In their lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, the group said the rule is \"arbitrary and capricious,\" as it grants the department unfettered power to target specific state policies or social programs.\n\n&gt; \"This administration has created a political loyalty test disguised as a regulation,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition of state AGs. \"It is unjust and unlawful to cut off loan forgiveness for hardworking Americans based on ideology.\"",

Kennedy, Jr., commit to preserving Americans’ access to vaccines and protecting the nation’s scientific and public health infrastructure. We, like so many others, hoped that the legions of career public health professionals who valued evidence and science would be able to educate the Secretary and his team, thus safeguarding our nation’s public health infrastructure and preserving public confidence in the work of these important institutions. Under the Secretary’s leadership, key public health protections have been weakened, and the immunization review process is devoid of experts and evidence.   \n\nThe Secretary’s consistent pattern of circumventing process and ignoring or downplaying scientific evidence is undermining the ability of any member of the Health and Human Services department to operate effectively. His own conflicts of interest and inability to see the conflicts of those in his inner circle further undermine his credibility and that of his entire department.  \n\nToday, we are in an environment where HHS and its leaders are fostering confusion, chaos and conspiracies.

A professional degree is a degree that:\n\n(i) Signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree:\n\n(ii) Is generally at the doctoral level, and that requires at least six academic years of postsecondary education coursework for completion, including at least two years of post-baccalaureate level coursework:\n\n(iii) Generally requires professional licensure to begin practice; and\n\n(iv) Includes a four-digit program CIP code, as assigned by the institution or determined by the Secretary, in the same intermediate group as the fields listed in paragraph (2) (i) of this definition.\n\n2. A professional degree may be awarded in the following fields:\n\n(i) Pharmacy (Pharm.D.), Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.), Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.), Law (L.L.B. or J.D.), Medicine (M.D.), Optometry (O.D.), Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.), Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.), and Clinical Psychology (Psy.D.) \n\n(3) A professional student under this definition:\n\n(i) May not receive title IV aid as an undergraduate student for the same period of enrollment; and\n\n(ii) Must be enrolled in a program leading to a professional degree under paragraph (2) of this definition.”\n\nI have mixed feelings on this, because I have a great respect for each of these fields. I think each healthcare team member is vitally important (from the sanitation technician to the physician). My dad is a PT (DPT, OCS), and to think of him as not a professional, given his level of expertise, seems short-sighted. I also hate the idea of people not being able to afford to become a nurse, PA, PT, etc., because their loans are capped at a much lower tier, because they are not \"professional\" degrees. Overall, I am just not sure if this is a W or L.\n\nTL;DR Loans are going to be capped lower for non-\"professional\" degrees per a new definition created by the Dept of Ed; nursing, PT, PA, and others appear to not qualify as professional per new guidelines to be potentially implemented July 2026.",

And I can show you the definition of abortion in Texas and it says removal of a miscarriage is not an abortion.\"\n\nHughes said the legislature is working on clarifying the language, but the law has yet to be amended.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n[https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban](https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban)\n\n...\n\nBut because D&amp;Cs are also used to end pregnancies, the procedure has become tangled up in state legislation that restricts abortions. In Texas, any doctor who violates the strict law risks up to 99 years in prison. Porsha’s is the fifth case ProPublica has reported in which women died after they did not receive a D&amp;C or its second-trimester equivalent, a dilation and evacuation; three of those deaths were in Texas.\n\n...\n\nTexas doctors told ProPublica the law has changed the way their colleagues see the procedure; some no longer consider it a first-line treatment, fearing legal repercussions or dissuaded by the extra legwork required to document the miscarriage and get hospital approval to carry out a D&amp;C. This has occurred, ProPublica found, even in cases like Porsha’s where there isn’t a fetal heartbeat or the circumstances should fall under an exception in the law. Some doctors are transferring those patients to other hospitals, which delays their care, or they’re defaulting to treatments that aren’t the medical standard.\n\n...\n\n“Stigma and fear are there for D&amp;Cs in a way that they are not for misoprostol,” said Dr. Alison Goulding, an OB-GYN in Houston. “Doctors assume that a D&amp;C is not standard in Texas anymore, even in cases where it should be recommended. People are afraid: They see D&amp;C as abortion and abortion as illegal.”\n\n...\n\nStill, the doctor didn’t mention a D&amp;C at this point, records show. Medical experts told ProPublica that this wait-and-see approach has become more common under abortion bans. Unless there is “overt information indicating that the patient is at significant risk,” hospital administrators have told physicians to simply monitor them, said Dr. Robert Carpenter, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works in several hospital systems in Houston. Methodist declined to share its miscarriage protocols with ProPublica or explain how it is guiding doctors under the abortion ban.\n\nAs Porsha waited for Hope, a radiologist completed an ultrasound and noted that she had “a pregnancy of unknown location.” The scan detected a “sac-like structure” but no fetus or cardiac activity. This report, combined with her symptoms, indicated she was miscarrying.\n\nBut the ultrasound record alone was less definitive from a legal perspective, several doctors explained to ProPublica. Since Porsha had not had a prenatal visit, there was no documentation to prove she was 11 weeks along. On paper, this “pregnancy of unknown location” diagnosis could also suggest that she was only a few weeks into a normally developing pregnancy, when cardiac activity wouldn’t be detected. Texas outlaws abortion from the moment of fertilization; a record showing there is no cardiac activity isn’t enough to give physicians cover to intervene, experts said.\n\nDr. Gabrielle Taper, who recently worked as an OB-GYN resident in Austin, said that she regularly witnessed delays after ultrasound reports like these. “If it’s a pregnancy of unknown location, if we do something to manage it, is that considered an abortion or not?” she said, adding that this was one of the key problems she encountered. After the abortion ban went into effect, she said, “there was much more hesitation about: When can we intervene, do we have enough evidence to say this is a miscarriage, how long are we going to wait, what will we use to feel definitive?”\n\n...\n\nPerforming a D&amp;C, though, attracts more attention from colleagues, creating a higher barrier in a state where abortion is illegal, explained Goulding, the OB-GYN in Houston. Staff are familiar with misoprostol because it’s used for labor, and it only requires a doctor and a nurse to administer it. To do a procedure, on the other hand, a doctor would need to find an operating room, an anesthesiologist and a nursing team. “You have to convince everyone that it is legal and won’t put them at risk,” said Goulding. “Many people may be afraid and misinformed and refuse to participate — even if it’s for a miscarriage.”\n\n...\n\nSince Porsha died, several families in Texas have spoken publicly about similar circumstances. This May, when Ryan Hamilton’s wife was bleeding while miscarrying at 13 weeks, the first doctor they saw at Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville noted no fetal cardiac activity and ordered misoprostol, according to medical records. When they returned because the bleeding got worse, an emergency doctor on call, Kyle Demler, said he couldn’t do anything considering “the current stance” in Texas, according to Hamilton, who recorded his recollection of the conversation shortly after speaking with Demler. (Neither Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville nor Demler responded to several requests for comment.)\n\nThey drove an hour to another hospital asking for a D&amp;C to stop the bleeding, but there, too, the physician would only prescribe misoprostol, medical records indicate. Back home, Hamilton’s wife continued bleeding until he found her passed out on the bathroom floor. “You don’t think it can really happen like that,” said Hamilton. “It feels like you’re living in some sort of movie, it’s so unbelievable.”\n\nAcross Texas, physicians say they blame the law for interfering with medical care. After ProPublica reported last month on two women who died after delays in miscarriage care, 111 OB-GYNs sent a letter to Texas policymakers, saying that “the law does not allow Texas women to get the lifesaving care they need.”\n\nDr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, told ProPublica that if one person on a medical team doubts the doctor’s choice to proceed with a D&amp;C, the physician might back down. “You constantly feel like you have someone looking over your shoulder in a punitive, vigilante type of way.”\n\nThe criminal penalties are so chilling that even women with diagnoses included in the law’s exceptions are facing delays and denials. Last year, for example, legislators added an update to the ban for patients diagnosed with previable premature rupture of membranes, in which a patient’s water breaks before a fetus can survive. Doctors can still face prosecution for providing abortions in those cases, but they are offered the chance to justify themselves with what’s called an “affirmative defense,” not unlike a murder suspect arguing self defense. This modest change has not stopped some doctors from transferring those patients instead of treating them; Dr. Allison Gilbert, an OB-GYN in Dallas, said doctors send them to her from other hospitals. “They didn’t feel like other staff members would be comfortable proceeding with the abortion,” she said. “It’s frustrating that places still feel like they can’t act on some of these cases that are clearly emergencies.” Women denied treatment for ectopic pregnancies, another exception in the law, have filed federal complaints.\n\n...\n\nThis past May, Marlena Stell, a patient with symptoms nearly identical to Porsha’s, arrived at another hospital in the system, Houston Methodist The Woodlands. According to medical records, she, too, was 11 weeks along and bleeding heavily. An ultrasound confirmed there was no fetal heartbeat and indicated the miscarriage wasn’t complete. “I assumed they would do whatever to get the bleeding to stop,” Stell said.\n\nInstead, she bled for hours at the hospital. She wanted a D&amp;C to clear out the rest of the tissue, but the doctor gave her methergine, a medication that’s typically used after childbirth to stop bleeding but that isn’t standard care in the middle of a miscarriage, doctors told ProPublica. \"She had heavy bleeding, and she had an ultrasound that's consistent with retained products of conception.\" said Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, who reviewed the records. \"The standard of care would be a D&amp;C.\"\n\nStell says that instead, she was sent home and told to “let the miscarriage take its course.” She completed her miscarriage later that night, but doctors who reviewed her case, so similar to Porsha’s, said it showed how much of a gamble physicians take when they don’t follow the standard of care. “She got lucky — she could have died,” Abbott said. (Houston Methodist did not respond to a request for comment on Stell’s care.)\n\nIt hadn’t occurred to Hope that the laws governing abortion could have any effect on his wife’s miscarriage. Now it’s the only explanation that makes sense to him. “We all know pregnancies can come out beautifully or horribly,” Hope told ProPublica. “Instead of putting laws in place to make pregnancies safer, we created laws that put them back in danger.”\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://www.smfm.org/emtala#:\\~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Alliance,care%2C%20even%20in%20emergency%20situations](https://www.smfm.org/emtala#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Alliance,care%2C%20even%20in%20emergency%20situations)\n\nSigned into law in 1986, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals that receive Medicare funds to treat and stabilize anyone who presents with an emergency medical condition, regardless of their ability to pay and regardless of the type of care required.  If the hospital is not equipped to provide treatment, it must arrange a transfer.  [EMTALA requires hospitals to offer abortion care](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-22-22-hospitals.pdf) if needed to stabilize a pregnant person in an emergent situation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers several [resources](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)[ ](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)for providers. \n\nSince the Dobbs decision, there has been litigation focused on whether EMTALA’s requirements to provide stabilizing care supersede state abortion bans.\n\n...\n\n*Texas*\n\n* In October 2024, the US Supreme Court denied the [Biden Administration's petition](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/court-turns-down-bidens-bid-for-intervention-in-texas-emergency-abortion-dispute/#:~:text=By%20Amy%20Howe,threatens%20their%20lives%20or%20health) to hear the Texas case, thereby leaving the lower court’s ruling intact. \n\n* In August 2022, a federal judge agreed with the State of Texas and temporarily blocked the HHS EMTALA guidance.

Some portions of this guidance are now unenforceable in Texas and for members of certain anti-abortion organizations due to a court injunction.  \n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hate how lawmakers and families are putting the blame on their physicians and hospitals when we have elected representatives who campaigned on and wrote an anti-abortion law with massive penalties for violation and unclear exemptions for emergency care. No wonder Ob/Gyns are fleeing the state, who wants to watch their patient hemorrhage to death while you wonder if you will be prosecuted with a risk of life imprisonment for providing life-saving treatment?",

You might've seen our campaign a few months back when we voted to unionize and strike in September—yeah, that fight.\n\nAfter more than a year of painful negotiations, we finally ratified a contract in December. It gave us a much-needed salary bump and some bonuses, including a $2k educational stipend from GME. It felt like a win for, like, five seconds.\n\nNow? GME has *completely gutted* every residency program's wellness and programmatic funds. These were the funds that covered things like lunches during didactics, wellness activities, and even our graduation celebrations. All gone. It seems like they just repackaged our old funds into this “new” educational stipend to make it look like they were giving us something extra. And to add insult to injury, they're claiming we’re not even eligible for the full $2k because we signed the contract mid-academic year.\n\nIt feels like this was their plan all along—throw us a bone, take everything else away, and punish us for standing up for ourselves. Wellness? Nah, apparently not something we deserve anymore.\n\nTo give you an idea of how desperate things are, someone even started a GoFundMe to help us cover what GME ripped away. I’m not linking it here (because rules), but just know: it’s bad.\n\nI’m so sick of the exploitation. If you're in the medical community or just care about how healthcare workers are treated, please spread the word about what’s happening here. UB residents deserve better.\n\nEnd rant.",

    "text": "Some new reporting came out yesterday regarding a previously widely publicized study that purported lower mortality rates in black babies cared for by black rather than white physicians.\n\nHere is the initial reddit post when the study was published: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/s/HMNte8DCTy\n\nAnd here is the discussion of a review of the study performed in PNAS: https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/s/7Wo8Qr6zPf\n\nThe short summary is that the review showed that the initial statistical analysis failed to control for birth weight of the infants, one of the strongest predictors of infant mortality. White doctors were much more likely to care for low or very low birth weight infants, leading to their higher overall mortality rates. When controlling for this variable the survival rates were not significantly different. \n\nNow there's this. A reporter filed a FOIA request for correspondence between authors and reviewers of the article and found that the study did see a survival benefit with racial concordance between physician and patient, however it was only with white infants and physicians. They removed lines in the paper stating that it does not fit the narrative that they sought to publish with the study. \n\n\nhttps://dailycaller.com/2025/03/31/exclusive-researchers-axed-data-point-undermining-narrative-that-white-doctors-are-biased-against-black-babies/\n\n\nPretty wild that they were so open about that in official correspondence.

    "title": "Medicine Isn’t the Golden Ticket It Used to Be",
    "text": "There’s often an overly optimistic view of medicine’s financial outlook. People repeat “don’t go into medicine for the money,” yet counter with “find me another job with stability, reasonable hours, and $300k+ pay.”\n\nWhen I applied to medical school, I also applied to competitive finance programs, which many of my peers pursued. Now, in their late 20s to early 30s, they work 40–50 hours a week, earn base salaries around $300k (plus bonuses), and carry far less debt.\n\nI value medicine for the work itself, but financially it’s only an okay, not exceptional, decision. Physician salaries have lagged behind inflation, while education and practice costs rise. Finance has risks, but overall stability is comparable to medicine. Advancement to managing director or partner is competitive, though not nearly as difficult as matching into neurosurgery or orthopedics, and compensation at that level reaches multiple seven figures.\n\nMost in finance choose mid-level roles for lifestyle reasons, yet even those roles pay more than the average GP with far less debt. For anyone entering medicine primarily for “stable” income, it’s important to recognize there are equally stable paths with higher earnings and fewer barriers.\n\nEdit: I think the biggest draw to medicine, especially after looking at the comments of those that worked in finance is that you never have to question if you are taking away from society or giving to it. Medicine is one of the very few careers that offer this while paying well. ",

    "text": "Full disclosure, i'm a male EM Doctor, so my perspective here may be limited.\n\nIn my practice, i've noticed that women tend to find a simple speculum exam quite uncomfortable and the only reason i'm not more liberal with versed or fentanyl/morphine is i don't want allegations of impropriety (though i always have a female chaperone present). I tend to provide topical/local anaesthesia for bartholin cysts/abscess drainage and IV pain meds (which i also do for normal abscesses).\n\nBut talking to my gf, female friends/family/coworkers/patients, it seems the only analgesic used in the office is ibuprofen. For anything -- IUD insertion, cyst/abscess drainage, biopsy. A lot of these are at least somewhat invasive and definitely painful. I know conscious sedation isn't an option on the office, but topical lido and cervical blocks exist. It just seems more nicer.\n\nEDIT:  \n1. I've removed some of my more inflammatory wording, since i was definitely in a bad mood when i posted this.  \n2. I've also removed some of the procedures i initially listed as i was probably just misinformed.  \n3. To the many of you responding that you offer pain control or anxiolysis other than ibuprofen, i appreciate it. It would seem the women in my life and the patients i get in my ER are just unlucky with their physicians.  \n4. Pertaining to the people who've been kind enough and thorough enough to provide literature support, that's fair. In my own practice, i'm still erring on the side of offering meds.

    "text": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/ridgewood/nj-surgeon-who-resigned-over-charlie-kirk-comments-calls-nurses-accusations\n\nThe article below:\n\n“BERGEN COUNTY, NJ — A doctor who resigned from a North Jersey hospital last week after a nurse reported his reaction to the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk disputed the accusations against him in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nSurgeon Matthew Jung said he \"do[es] not condone violence for any reason\" and said that the stories about him have resulted in \"a wave of racial slurs and death threats against me. Sadly, it also led to threats against other minority physicians I once worked alongside, and against the hospital itself.\"\n\nJung said that he resigned from the hospital on Sept. 15 not because he was guilty, but because he wanted the threats to end.\n\nPolitical violence against health professionals has been on the upswing, reports say.\n\nThe controversy began after media outlets reported that Lexie Kuenzle, a nurse at Englewood Hospital in Bergen County, filed a lawsuit in Bergen County Superior Court on Sept. 12, alleging that she was suspended after reporting Jung's comments in relation to Kirk's killing.\n\nFind out what's happening in Ridgewood-Glen Rockfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nYour email address\nSubscribe\nKirk was assassinated during a stop on his \"American Comeback\" tour on the Utah valley University campus on Sept. 10. A suspect in the fatal shooting, Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody two days later. READ MORE: 5 Things To Know About Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk's Accused Killer\n\nIn her lawsuit, Kuenzle alleged that when news was reported about Kirk's fatal shooting, \"In front of patients and staff, Dr. [Matthew] Jung cheered and publicly praised the murder.\"\n\nKuenzle said that she was concerned that a doctor who had taken the Hippocratic Oath had celebrated someone's death in earshot of other medical professionals and a patient.\n\nShe alleged that as a Christian, his comments created a \"hostile work environment.\"\n\nThe hospital responded with a statement on Sept. 13 saying that it had not fired Kuenzle—as some news outlets reported—but that it had suspended both Kuenzle and Jung in order to investigate the situation.\n\nTwo days later, the hospital sent a short statement saying that they had accepted Jung's resignation.\n\nAt the time, Jung did not give his side of the story publicly.\n\n\"I Am Also A Christian...'\n\nKuenzle's lawsuit noted that her employers were aware of her Christian faith and asked, \"What happened when a horrified Christian Nurse was the victim of Dr. Jung’s anti-religious rant? As a result of Plaintiff’s engagement in the protected activity above, she suffered an adverse job action.\"\n\nJung said in his statement on Tuesday afternoon that he, too, is a Christian, as well as a \"minority and queer\" man.\n\n\"Several hospital staff asked me who he was and why this [the assassination] might have happened,\" Jung said in his statement on Tuesday, giving his own account of that day. \"In trying to explain, I mentioned that his platform had included rhetoric that many – including minorities like myself and several of the staff – found discriminatory. I spoke about how hatred can fuel more hatred and often leads to violence. But I was in no way 'cheering' for Mr. Kirk to be shot and killed, as has been alleged.\"\n\nJung said, \"While his words have caused real pain for many, he did not deserve that kind of hatred – nor did racial minorities or those in the LGBTQ+ community who were targets of his rhetoric. Words are powerful – both his and mine. And I am deeply sorry I did not choose mine more carefully, especially as they’ve been so badly misrepresented.\"\"\n\n\"I am a minority and Queer,\" he said, \"two groups Mr. Kirk frequently targeted. But I also am a Christian, born and raised in New York who worked my way through college and then medical school. I dedicated my life to serving my patients with compassion at their most critical moments, regardless of their race, political beliefs, gender identity, or anything else. Those who have worked with me know me best. And amidst all the hatred and vitriol, I also have received a tremendous outpouring of support.\"\n\nHe said his discussion was with hospital staff, and that the nurse released a \"misleading narrative about what I said and meant. She did this while casting herself as the victim ... In fact, I am the one who no longer works at the hospital. She continues to seek the television limelight for her own publicity.\"\n\nEnglewood Hospital did not respond by press time when asked for a comment.”\n\nSounds like this started as a verbal misunderstanding at work, nurse doxxed him online, led to threats against him, coworkers, and hospital. And the hospital forced him to resign but kept the nurse….\n",

    "title": "Hawaii’s largest hospital alerts staff after imaging backlog reaches 8,000 exams",
    "text": "[Link.](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-staffing/hawaiis-largest-hospital-alerts-staff-after-imaging-backlog-reaches-8000-exams)\n\nHawaii’s largest hospital recently alerted staff after its backlog of unread medical images reached 8,000, according to a report published Thursday. \n\nQueen’s Medical Center in Honolulu—and others in the Aloha State—are grappling with significant shortages of both radiologists and technologists. The state needed at least 10 more rads as of last year, a number that has likely worsened in 2025, the University of Hawaii’s John A. Burns School of Medicine estimates. \n\nAmid these shortages, Queen’s Medical Center radiologists are prioritizing exams for emergency patients and individuals with upcoming appointments or procedures, Hawaii News Now reported [April 17](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/04/18/radiology-workforce-shortage-hits-hawaii-hospitals-with-thousands-patient-scans-queue/). \n\n“Like other healthcare organizations in Hawaii and across the United States, we are facing a shortage of radiologists,” Darlena Chadwick, Queen’s Health Systems chief operating officer, told the TV station. “We are seeing high volumes of diagnostic imaging requests, which \\[tend\\] to be some of the sickest patients in our community. The care of our patients is our highest priority, and we are working diligently every day to address any delays.”\n\nChadwick said this includes active efforts to recruit additional full-time radiologists, along with bringing aboard telerad temps to work through the queue. Meanwhile on the technologist front, the Healthcare Association of Hawaii [estimated](https://www.hah.org/hwi) in January that there are about 160 open positions. This represents a 39% increase since 2022 and includes 49 ultrasound technologist job openings, a 24% vacancy rate. \n\n“Healthcare leaders are increasingly concerned about filling radiologic technologist and ultrasound technologist roles,” the association, which represents over 170 healthcare organizations in Hawaii, said earlier this year. “The demand for these professionals is growing, but because these roles require specialized education, employers struggle to find qualified candidates,” the HAH added, noting there was no sonographer training program in Hawaii at the time of the report.  \n\n[Indeed.com](http://Indeed.com) currently lists over 50 open radiology-related jobs in Hawaii including radiologist, tech, PACS administrator and nurse. Queen’s Health System is [advertising](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=920f90872ae5f748&amp;from=shareddesktop_copy) a salary of $840,000 for a general radiologist who’d work at its North Hawaii Community Hospital in Waimea. (That’s compared to a national average of $520,000, [Medscape](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/radiologist-salary/radiology-rises-no-2-highest-paid-specialty-surpassing-cardiology-and-plastic-surgery-medscape) estimated last week.) The four-hospital system has 11 CT scanners and 7 MRI machines, according to the job listing. Queens wants a rad who’d work a 40-hour week on a hybrid basis with shifts ending at 3:30 p.m. at its 35-bed rural acute care facility. It’s also offering a $20,000 signing bonus, $25,000 for relocation and $4,000 annually toward CME. \n\nWhile providers nationwide are grappling with staffing challenges, Hawaii’s struggles may be more pronounced due to its isolation and high cost of living. As of January, the state had about 4,700 open healthcare positions, the Healthcare Association of Hawaii estimated. When adjusting for various factors, the tally was about 3,835 (or 14% unfilled), down from 3,873 (or 17% unfilled) in 2022. ",

Free unlimited office food, free parking, free EV charging, free equinox membership. He got $10000 joining and relocation bonus. He gets to WFH whenever he feels too lazy to leave the house. He can call out sick at 8.55 am and doesn’t have to worry about coverage and what his manager/colleagues will think of him. He gets yearly appraisals, these don’t have any upper limit so if you’re a top performer in the company you can easily cross $1 million salary \n\nThe perks my husband enjoys is standard in the tech industry. He’s had jobs like this since he graduated from his 4 year undergrad. He graduated with an average GPA and had only 1 tech focused internship so it’s not like he was the top 0.1% of his class to be able to get jobs like this.\n\nAnd here I am slaving away in residency, working 80 hour weeks for &lt;$12/hr. I’ve been grinding for this since I was 18, went to one of the top med schools in my country, now I’m nearly 30 and I don’t even have 1/50th of my husband’s net worth. I’m in IM so the only job I can think of that comes close to my husband’s WLB is being a PCP, for half his salary alas. If I want to make as much money as him as a pcp I would need to move to rural middle of nowhere. PD and seniors are unsupportive and passive aggressive, no matter how hard we work we can never catch a break. We don’t get free cafeteria food and have to pay $200/month for parking.\n\nI hate my life. I wish I could go back in time and do engineering instead of med school. Rant over",

    "title": "99% done with MD; dismissed; sent healthcare career possible? Desperate for advice.",
    "text": "So.. here is my story. I’m lost, I’m ashamed, and I am desperate for career advice. I went to a Caribbean medical school. I was a decent student, but I struggled with exams and anxiety. I got through basic sciences w/o any trouble until the end. I just couldn’t pass the Basic Science Comp and ended up repeating Med 5. I struggled with depression/anxiety only made worse by repeated failure. At my lowest I was entangled in an abusive relationship (got out), dealt with financial struggles, and some health problems (my dental health in shambles, multiple teeth missing, unable to afford care). Despite all of that, I passed comp, I passed Step 1 and got to clinicals.\n\nClinicals started out well—Honors in everything. Until the pandemic. My school dropped the ball and we had chaos. No in person rotations. Our rotations and shelf exams didn’t match up anymore so I was in psychiatry rotation but studying for the OBGYN shelf in the rotation that ended 6 weeks ago. In peds, but studying for surgery shelf. Mentally and physically, I was defeated. I sludged my way through and completed the curriculum. I even got 2 interviews w/o a Step 2 score during my poorly timed attempt at matching (1 in peds and 1 in anesthesia) But I could not pass the comp for clinical sciences. I failed the comp multiple times. My school changed the criteria to pass. I just wasn’t up to snuff. I wasn’t allowed to take Step 2 &amp; got dismissed. I have done everything I can to get back in. I’ve begged and battled with the school for 2 years. I got into another Caribbean med school with some fishy loans not covered by the department of education. I couldn’t qualify and never enrolled.\n\nSince then, I have been working as a medical scribe and a server at a Chinese restaurant. I stay medically relevant, I get health insurance, and can pay my monthly minimum to Sallie Mae. I owe 1/2 an M at this point—there’s some loans from undergrad &amp; grad school (MS in Cell Biology) added in there. I earned enough money to get my whole mouth fixed (multiple implants, major dental surgery). I was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease that’s now managed (doctors were saying I was crazy for years), in therapy and medicated for depression &amp; anxiety, lost 40 lbs, and got married. Rebuilding my confidence, but I don’t want to live like this.\n\nMy dream is still to be a doctor. It was never a job to me. It was my passion, but I believe that ship has sailed. It hurts my heart, but working on it in therapy. I am looking at other avenues to work in medicine—NP, AA, PA, Dentistry (I learned SOO much during my autoimmune/depression/dental traverse through hell). I was an ace at diagnosis, great with my hands &amp; procedures. My attendings used to say I had the skill &amp; knowledge.\n\nIf you’ve made it this far, I love and appreciate you. Any advice? I’m willing to start over. But who would take me, a dismissed med school failure? With expired MCAT and prerequisites. Some PA programs specifically say they don’t want applicants like me (former MD candidates). I don’t want to insult allied health programs like they’re a consolation prize. I would do anything to be in the world of medicine again. Any career advice? I’m lost and I’m in a hole.\n\n\nTL;DR: I finished a Caribbean medical school’s curriculum. But I couldn’t pass the final comprehensive exam which allows me to take Step 2.  Dream is to be a doctor. But reality: I failed and I owe &gt;500K. Desperate for career advice. Follow dream on a decade long path or pivot to Allied Health like PA/AA/NP. Would I even be considered??\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*UPDATE*\n\n\nHonestly, I’m humbled by the response. Yeah, I did a bit of cross posting but I did not anticipate this amount of support, advice, and honesty when I wrote this. I gave medical school my best shot and it makes my heart ache. But I’m looking into allied health programs like ABSN, PA, and AA—NOT as a consolation prize (please don’t come for me!!) This has helped me more than you know.",

    "title": "Some of you are terrible romantic partners (and should probably apologize to your exes).",
    "text": "This is going to be long so buckle up and grab some popcorn.\n\nTo give a little bit of background information about myself, I'm a current med student in a relationship. However, I dated two med students before I started medical school. I also spent a little too much time lurking on this sub before matriculation, being the gunner I am.\n\nBefore I say anything, I will say yes, medical school is extremely difficult. It takes an immense amount of time, sacrifice, and resources, and will end up impacting your mental health and relationships at some point. The person you are with has to understand that going in. There will be nights where you talk to them for five minutes before crashing in bed. There will be days where you cancel plans because you have to study. There will be times where school destroys you mentally and emotionally and your SO will have to pick up the pieces and put them back together. Your partner is going to have to understand that they will essentially be the 1b priority for the next four years (if not longer).\n\nAll that being said, Jesus Christ. Some of you treat your partners terribly. They are not your 24/7 on-call therapists for you to constantly complain about everything in your life: school, family, finances, your friends and classmates, even the relationship itself. You cannot expect endless emotional support with almost none in return. They are also human beings. They have off days, they have frustrations, they get stressed, they make mistakes. Giving yourself maximum grace because you're in medical school and extremely stressed while giving them very little is ridiculous. They're also not robots. They're people with emotions who go through good times and bad times. If their bad times (within reason) become a burden to you and stress you out while you're constantly venting about the bad time that is medical school, you're a bad partner.\n\nGiving them very little time or attention. Sure, you may text throughout the day, but if you go weeks without doing things as a couple, whether it's going out for a meal, watching a movie, or just enjoying time in each other's presence, then why are you in this relationship? I understand there are certain blocks and rotations where time is scarce, but again, this is your partner. They are supposed to be priority 1b, not priority 17. I've seen classmates who make sure they sleep a certain number of hours a day, meal prep, exercise for 30 minutes to an hour multiple days a week, get research and shadowing in, even occasionally hang out with friends or classmates, and when they finish their exams, they go out to celebrate and let off some steam. I then hear them complain that their boyfriend or girlfriend is upset they never get to see them. If in all that you aren't finding a few moments of time for the person who is emotionally supporting you through all this, then you are a bad partner, plain and simple.\n\nCheating, oh my goodness. Cheating is rampant. I understand you're getting a bunch of 20-year-olds and putting them in the same space for hours a week, but holy shit. The first week of med school I saw multiple classmates cheat on their partners during orientation. I've seen students get drunk and end up in strangers' beds. I've seen students making out with classmates at the bar in front of everyone when we all know they're in relationships. I've seen people break up with the person they dated for years in college and who supported them on their premed journey because they wanted to \"see what was out there.\" Medicine is the only field I've ever known, so perhaps there are other fields where it's worse, but I don't think I've ever seen people use their partners more transactionally than med students. It's almost psychotic.\n\nLong-distance? Forget about it. Those of you who make it work are incredible people, and I wish more people in this world in general were willing to put as much effort into their relationships as you do. Some of you, however, are the opposite. You have to go wherever you get in for medical school. This is our dream, and we are willing to move to Timbuktu to achieve it. That being said, the parameters of a long-distance relationship are different, and you have to adjust. Being in a relationship as a med student, your partner will already have to sacrifice a lot. In this case, they may have to be the one making a lot of the trips to come see you. They may have to be the one that moves to be closer to you. If they're willing to do these things and you are not going to support them at all in return, then please do not be in a relationship.\n\nI dated someone going to school in San Francisco. She was constantly complaining about the distance, and I was ready to move out there, leaving my friends and family behind to be with her and support her during school. She, however, wanted to live with her friends, so she essentially wanted me to move out there and get my own place. Her family financially supported her, so her apartment was paid for. My apartment would not be. She also wanted me to have an open-door policy where she could come see me whenever she was stressed, needed to vent, or wanted to spend the night. If those same things happened to me, I would have to text her in advance, and she would then decide on whether I could come stay with her or if she was too busy and needed to focus. Needless to say, I did not move to San Francisco and ended the relationship. This was just the tip of the iceberg, but long story short, long-distance is tough for everyone. If you're in one as a med student, please keep in mind it is not easy for either party. Be kind.\n\nThe responses of other med students, whether on here or in person, are wild. Anytime I see a post about someone going through a painful breakup on this subreddit, the comments are essentially along the lines of, \"This person didn't deserve you. You are going to be a successful doctor making good money, and if they can't deal with the circumstances of you being a med student, then they're a bad partner.\" Bitch, no. Some of you don't understand this, so I will say it very clearly: you becoming a doctor and making a great salary does not mean your partner has to put up with years of bullshit. Again, they will not be the main priority, but they should be 1b. If you want 1b to be taken up by something else, whether family, friends, having fun, whatever the case, then do not be in a relationship. I wish medicine actually attracted the most kind and empathetic people to the field, but in reality, a large portion of med students are people in their early twenties who come from affluent backgrounds, have no life experience, and have never really had to struggle in life. This tends to reflect in how their relationships go.\n\nI know that some people will read this and get upset, perhaps because they recognize some of the things they did to people they were in a relationship with and they don't want to admit it, and others because this is an extremely long and poorly written post that wasted 5 minutes of their life that they will never get back. I'm sure many of you are great partners, given the circumstances, who do as much as they can to be with their forever person. Others of you, I don't even know what to say. Your partner is not an emotional dumping ground for you to pull off the shelf when you feel like it and throw away when things become slightly inconvenient.  Please, just be kind.",

I imagine a lot of us wish it did because we all choose this career path and want to be interacting with medicine. But with the exception of a few schools, our success depends on our ability to pass a shelf exam and eventually STEP 2. This was an institutional choice, not ours.\n\nWe have duties outside of on site hours. Residents don't. We're not getting paid. Residents are. Please stop treating us like we are residents. We aren't residents. When I'm not expected to take ten exams a year, the failure of any of which may well lead to my dismissal from the program, I will gladly work 70 hours a week without a complaint. Until that day, for the love of all that is holy, we do not need to be working 12 hour days multiple days a week. \n\nThat's all.",

    "title": "The AAMC, Thalamus, and AI for Residency Applications: We Have a Major Problem",
    "text": "After seeing a recent post about the[ new AI-assisted tools rolling out for ERAS 2025](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1n730kd/fyi_cortex_thalamus_ai_application_screening_tool/), I did some digging and the situation is worse than I thought:\n\n* In an unprecedented first, the AAMC (a nonprofit) has taken a big stake in the private, for-profit company Thalamus, leading a $30 Million Series B funding round with other venture capitalist funds ([Jan 2025](https://www.thalamusgme.com/blogs/thalamus-raises-30-million-series-b-to-expand-physician-workforce-for-health-systems-and-patients-nationwide)). They are here to 10x+ the value of Thalamus and sell it off to a larger company. There is no good reason why Thalamus isn't non-profit.\n* Thalamus’ AI/ML powered software suite is being offered free to all ERAS-participating programs for the 2025 application season. This is a classic tech industry tactic to create dependency. Once programs are hooked, Thalamus (and its investors, including the AAMC) can monetize this tool. The AAMC is using its monopoly over ERAS to funnel users toward a product it now owns a piece of.\n* Since 2004, the Match has enjoyed **congressionally granted antitrust immunity**. This protection was meant to ensure a fair and efficient system for students and programs. Here, the AAMC is leveraging its monopoly to partner with, and profit from, a for-profit entity. This is a blatant abuse of power and the AAMC itself does not have antitrust immunity.\n* There is extremely limited transparency on how any of this AI/ML is being used. Right now, it seems that they have not rolled out the major AI features from their recent acquisition of Medicratic. They will be rolling these out throughout this ERAS season and will have them ready to go for ERAS 2026. There has been some study of AI for residency application screening, and there are good reasons to be concerned about this rolling out. (See [here ](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39509905/)and [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lary.32308)).\n\n**The AAMC’s investment in Thalamus isn’t just about interviews and application review. It’s about the AAMC selling the physician workforce pipeline to for-profit companies and venture capitalists**.  Thalamus is expanding into “broader physician recruitment” and “physician workforce management”, meaning they are aiming to impact the entire training pathway, job placement, continuing education, etc.\n\n[https:\\/\\/youtu.be\\/F7RjZamNXYY?t=2345](https://preview.redd.it/7ugeqj2gxrnf1.png?width=1336&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f0ed4e2734f4cdf7841344836582a41c9d5cbeb4)\n\n**If we don’t push back now, the entire trajectory of our careers will be shaped by for-profit algorithms.** When private equity controls both the hospitals and the physician training pipeline, it's over. This is your warning before the enshittification of this entire profession accelerates. There are still levers we can pull, but we really need to start making some noise. The AAMC just sold us all out, and I write this hoping that we have the spine to fight back. **We have power in numbers. At the end of the day, their revenue comes from us.**\n\n**The ask is simple: Keep for-profit companies out of the residency application process and increase transparency on the use of AI in application screening.**\n\nIn my last [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicalschool/comments/1n730kd/comment/nc4omsd/), I asked people to **reach out if you are interested in contributing to or signing off on some sort of Viewpoint article in JAMA+AI.** I initially wanted just 1 person from each school, but now I think we should try and gather everyone we can.

    "text": "Today was a very confusing day. \n\nDuring a break between lectures, I was chatting informally with another student in our classroom about specialty choice. We were both interested in Peds vs Psych vs Child Psych. I talked about the 2 weeks I spent on Child Psych and how I expected to like it but ended up pretty strongly disliking it.   \n  \nPLEASE NOTE: I really don't want this to be a thread about whether or not we all love child psych. I hope this is obvious, but I am not anti-child psychiatry. I simply do not think it is a good fit for me personally.\n\nAmong my reasons were these two:  \n  \n1) At my institution, we were overtly instructed not to be wholly truthful in our inpatient notes. Unlike adult psych consult notes, which are almost always \"blocked for privacy reasons,\" our child psych notes are not, and parents read them and apparently frequently get upset if they say anything they disagree with. I did not like this dynamic, personally. I think it would bother me too much to navigate that issue for the rest of my career.\n\n2) At my ambulatory child psych clinic, we saw a ton of kids with ADHD. Of course, there is nothing inherently wrong with that. But again, I did not always cope well with the dynamic of parents bringing in kids glued to their iPads and expecting medications to solve the problem. I'm not saying medications are bad or unhelpful. But there were frequently times when the provider and parent view were not aligned, and it was hard for me. And my personal opinion as a private individual is that I feel somewhat conflicted about these prescriptions and the decisions being made for these children. Maybe it's a me issue or a training issue, but regardless, I'm not willing to take a gamble that in the future I'll feel great about it and have no problem prescribing according to guidelines without feeling any distress.\n\nTherefore, despite loving Peds and loving my earlier adult Psych rotations, I did not enjoy Child Psych at all and feel it would likely be a very bad fit for me.  \n\n\nNow for the problem:\n\nApparently in or near this classroom was a staff-person listening. I don't know any details, but given the time/place (classroom between classes), it was most likely one of the numerous admins I've never met who have various roles in day-to-day operations like tech or scheduling etc.\n\nI received an email from one of medical school deans asking to meet for an un-named reason. I was wracking my brain trying to figure out what kind of major assignment I could have forgotten or messed up badly enough to get literally summoned, which has never happened to me before.\n\nThe Dean says I've been reported by someone who is a parent of a child who sees child psychiatry and was very offended by what I said. So offended, in fact, that they presented physically crying in her office. The exact complaint was pretty unclear, but the term \"parent-blaming\" was used. I was instructed to be more \"trauma-informed\" in the future. Those are really the only two specific terms I can recall. (I might have blacked out a little from shock, I don't know.)\n\n  \nMy thoughts:\n\nI mean, I obviously would not have been so blunt if I was (knowingly) speaking to a general audience with patients/families in the room. That said, this felt like a pretty average, appropriate, reasonable conversation for medical students to have in a medical school classroom. I feel weird that someone was lurking and reported it, and that my school's reaction was to honor this report and summon me and essentially \"give me a stern talking to\" and expect an apology. Am I happy I said something that resulted in someone crying? No, I'm not a monster. But.... something about this feels off to me.\n\n  \nHas anyone ever experienced something like this?? AITA??",

Funny, because I somehow made $700K this year while spending most of my life inside an OR and answering nonstop consults at 3 AM for things that definitely aren’t surgical.\n\nHow?\n\t•\tI learned how to bill properly. Turns out, saving someone’s life is actually worth more than a Taco Bell salary, who knew?\n\t•\tI own a surgery center. Because if the hospital is going to make millions off my work, I might as well get a cut.\n\t•\tI say yes to everything. Hernia? Sure. Gallbladder? No problem. Someone stubbed their toe but thinks it’s an emergency? Why not.\n\nI have partners who make over $1M, but they also haven’t seen their kids in years, consider sleeping four hours a “win,” and spend their vacations taking trauma call in a different state.  No, I do not need a “sign-on bonus” or a “stipend” I need RVU multipliers and a real buy-in, thank you very much.\n\nAnd let’s not forget profit sharing. Turns out, when you actually own a piece of the pie—whether it’s an SC, imaging center, or even a stake in the anesthesia group. You get a little extra on top of your base salary. While some docs cry about RVUs, I’m out here getting a cut every time someone orders a CT scan. \n\nOh, and before you cry about loans, I paid mine off in cash within two years. You can do it too, just say goodbye to sleep, happiness, and most of your relationships.\n\nFor any med students wondering if general surgery is worth it. Yes, if you like long hours, high stress, and being the person everyone calls when things go wrong.\n\nAnyway, gotta go, I just got consulted for an “acute abdomen” that’s really just constipation.",

    "text": "Most of us probably heard about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.  \n\nOn the bottom of the Maslow's needs pyramid are basic necessities, like food, shelter, employment, security, resources, etc., while the top of the pyramid are things like achievements, self-esteem, self-actualization, etc. \n\nOnce you get accepted into a USMD school, you're almost guaranteed to become some sort of doctor, make \\~250k-300k/year, with unparalleled job security. You just gotta pass your classes + board exams and don't do anything stupid, which, if you're aiming just for the bare minimum to get by, isn't ridiculously hard. \n\nSo most medical students don't have to stress about being able to fulfill the basic needs at the bottom two rungs of Maslow's needs pyramid (assuming nothing financially catastrophic happens to you during med school when you have 0 income). \n\nInstead, most of med students' stress comes from our desire to become the best doctor we can be for our future patients, match into our top choice specialty, build our ideal life, and reach our potential. In other words, most of our stress comes from our desire to fulfill needs at the top of Maslow's needs pyramid. \n\nThis is not true for most other people, including people in professions that are as competitive as medicine. For example, in fields like high finance, you gotta grind your ass off just so you can keep your job and not get laid off. Anecdotally, someone I knew got laid off from her finance job because she did not perform well enough to get promoted to the next level after a certain number of years, despite consistently working 60+ hours per week. Another example is scientific research. If you decide to do a PhD, the amount of job opportunities after you finish is depressingly low, and many people just have to take whatever job they can get. I know of multiple (brilliant) scientists who trained at top research institutions who ended up stuck in postdoc hell or abandoned their passions and left science completely, as they can't find any decent jobs in it. \n\nFor many people outside of medicine, difficulties with fulfilling needs in lower rungs of Maslow's needs hierarchy are a huge driver of their stress. And that type of stress sounds   much more soul-sucking than stress from wanting to reach self-actualization. \n\nJust want to share this perspective with y'all, as it had made me more grateful to be in med school and made the stress a bit more bearable, so maybe it can help you, too. \n\n ",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n  \nMatch Day has come and gone, and our current third-year medical students have started to think seriously about where they’ll be applying come September. A few of you really enjoyed both your pediatrics and internal medicine rotations, and perhaps you’re having a difficult time choosing between the two specialties. “How can I do both,” you might be asking yourself, “while keeping my future options open?”\n  \nEnter med-peds, a convenient specialty that squishes two three-year residencies into one four-year sprint. It’s full of kind, supportive people that are disproportionately involved in medical education and are really, _really_ passionate about their jobs. What’s not to like?\n  \nWell, some things, perhaps. In this post, I’d like to take an honest look at the state of med-peds, in part because I think that the specialty promotes itself well but is small enough to avoid many honest critiques. Keep in mind that I’m an n of 1; you should ask the med-peds residents at your institution about their experiences and form your own opinions.\n  \nMy credentials: I’m a recent graduate of a large university med-peds program. The specialty is a fairly small community that defends itself quite passionately, so I’ll be keeping my own background/experiences vague to allow for a bit more honesty in my post here. I’ll start with a few observations, in no particular order, along with some related recommendations:\n  \n*Med-peds attracts many smart but indecisive individuals that probably should’ve picked a categorical program.*  \nNot tooting my own horn, but I was one of these medical students. Many med-peds applicants loved every single rotation in medical school and did well on their boards and shelves, but when it came time to narrow their focus, they froze. Some (at least implicitly) bought into the falsehood that family medicine is “low prestige” and sought an “academic” specialty that would nevertheless allow them to climb the professorial ladder while maintaining a broad knowledge base. Others just didn’t get enough data from their medical school rotation to rule out med or peds, so they delayed a decision that should have been made during MS3 into residency. However, by the end of PGY2 or so, these residents decide that they prefer one specialty or the other, then have to grin and bear it through the latter half of their program.\n  \n_Recommendation:_ If you find yourself caught between IM and peds, sit down and really invest some time in making a thorough pros/cons list about the two specialties. Ask mentors to help fill them in. If you see the scales tipping definitively towards one or the other, _pick that specialty_! Don’t go into med-peds “just in case,” and have a legitimate reason for applying if you do!\n  \n_Pediatrics is changing rapidly._  \nMy bias is showing here, but I don’t think this is for the better. In the wake of the pediatric hospitalist controversy (look it up or ask a friend if you haven’t heard about this), the ACGME retooled their curriculum standards for pediatric residency programs to de-emphasize acute care settings and prioritize outpatient/preventive care work, a change that was ultimately implemented across the country in the past year. As a result, trainees have forfeited significant autonomy to fellows and midlevels. During my own training, the “responsibility gap” between IM and peds has widened noticeably with the passage of time. Moreover, parents have become more demanding and antivax sentiments are more common. It’s just a tough field to enter nowadays.\n  \n_Recommendation:_ Thoroughly examine your motivation to incorporate pediatrics into your medical career. If you’re doing it out of some vague enjoyment in contributing to the well-being of children, there are easier ways to do so. Hang out with your own kids/nieces/nephews, volunteer to coach a soccer team, or whatever. Only go into med-peds if you *absolutely need* to care medically for children in some area of your professional life. \n  \n_Family medicine provides a better broad-spectrum outpatient training experience…for most patients._  \nFamily med physicians spend more high-quality time in clinics than med-peds docs do, with an equivalent knowledge base for most disease processes and better procedural foundations than we have. Some med-peds attendings will argue that our emphasis on inpatient time better prepares us to manage more complex patients, but I imagine that intra-specialty variation on this point is more significant than between the two fields. My one caveat is that most med-peds programs place a heavy emphasis on outpatient care of medically complex children transitioning to adulthood, so if this topic appeals to you, med-peds may be a better choice. \n  \n_Recommendation:_ If you’re set on practicing broad-spectrum, outpatient healthcare for patients of all ages (and are certain that you don’t want to subspecialize), I encourage you to take a long look at family medicine. Consider doing an away rotation if your medical school doesn’t have an affiliated family medicine residency, and most importantly, **don’t rule the specialty out because of \"prestige stigma\" from peers or professors**. If you want to improve your ability to care for medically complex children with chronic diseases into adulthood, med-peds might be a better fit for you.\n  \n_(Good) reasons to apply to med-peds_  \nNow that we’ve covered my med-peds caveats, I can think of multiple reasons why someone might be a good fit for the specialty, though this list isn’t exhaustive:  \n- You like full-spectrum primary care for medically complex patients (though I’d argue that family docs do this every day!).  \n- You are pursuing a subspecialty with an interest in the lifelong care of a particular condition, particularly during the transition from childhood to adulthood (e.g. endo for T1DM, cardiology for congenital heart disease, heme/onc for sickle cell).  \n- You want to practice full-spectrum hospital medicine (and are willing to pursue PHM fellowship if you’re staying in academics).  \n- You are planning on going into an acute care pediatric fellowship like PEM or PICU and want more resuscitation experience as a resident.  \n- You have eclectic, wide ranging interests in treating a variety of adult and pediatric conditions and prefer a generalist specialty that has more depth of training over a longer time period than family med offers.  \n- You want to pursue an academic career at an institution with no family medicine department, but still want to care for both adults and children.\n  \n_So, You’ve Decided on Med-Peds_  \nA few closing recommendations if you’ve decided to proceed into the Wonderful World of Med-Peds™:  \n- _Don’t cut corners_: You’re fitting two distinct specialties into a four-year residency; look for a program with sufficient rigor.  \n- _Who will your co-residents be_: Your experience in med-peds will be, more than other specialties, defined by personnel external to your program. Look closely at the categorical programs that you’ll be rotating with and ask if their cultures differ significantly from the med-peds program’s.  \n- _Clinic matters_: Ask hard questions about the quality of a program’s continuity clinic—if you want to do outpatient med-peds, this is critical. Ask about the balance of adults and children seen there.  \n  \nWould love to hear thoughts from other med-peds residents/attendings in the comments. For current med students, I wish you all the best on your specialty decision journey!\n  \n**tl;dr: Med-peds is a great specialty for applicants that want to focus on primary care for medically complex patients OR have a particular interest in transition care of a certain disease, but medical students should do some soul-searching prior to applying and many should ultimately choose a categorical program.**\n\nEdit: Some formatting",

    "title": "Bipartisan bill Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act (H.R. 879) introduced to House to reverse 2.83% payment cuts while also granting payment adjustments for inflations, for a total positive adjustment of 6.62%",
    "text": "[https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/879](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/879)\n\nThe bipartisan bill [Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act (H.R. 879)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/879?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hr+879%22%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=4) was reintroduced in Congress to try and block the 2.83 percent Medicare pay cut physicians and actually increase the amount paid to cover inflationary costs.\n\nIf passed, this legislation would prospectively stop the 2.83% pay cut physicians received starting Jan. 1, 2025. The bill would be in effect from April 1 through Dec. 31, 2025. Compounded with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates of a projected 3.6% increase in practice cost expenses for this year due to inflation, physicians could face a 6.43% cut unless Congress acts. This bill looks to reverse the payment cuts while also granting payment adjustments for inflations, for a total positive adjustment of 6.62%.\n\nAccording to the [American Medical Association (AMA)](https://www.ama-assn.org/), when adjusted for inflation, Medicare reimbursement for physician services has declined 33% from 2001 to 2025. This has spurred loud outcry from all of the major U.S. medical associations. The AMA and many societies have predicted that Medicare reimbursement cuts for physicians are creating far-reaching consequences for the American healthcare system, particularly in rural and underserved areas.\n\nCosts for staffing and operations continue to climb, and declining reimbursement rates are forcing practices to make difficult decisions, such as layoffs, reduced services, or permanent closures. These closures are disproportionally impacting rural and lower-income areas. The AMA has said some physicians have already decided to no longer accept Medicare patients because the payments do not cover the costs for providing care.\n\nThis is also being compounded by a growing shortage of physicians and an aging population of doctors nearing retirement. These these cuts have exacerbated physician burnout and medical groups have said threaten to further limit access to care for Medicare patients.\n\nThe bipartisan bill was reintroduced Jan. 31 by [Congressmen Gregory F. Murphy, MD](https://murphy.house.gov/bio), (R-North Carolina) a urology and renal transplantation surgeon, along with 37 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, including numerous physician members of the House.\n\n\"Physicians in America are facing unprecedented financial viability challenges due to continued Medicare cuts. Access to affordable and quality healthcare for millions of seniors is in severe jeopardy,\" said Congressman Murphy in a statement. \"Doctors see Medicare patients out of compassion, not for financial gain. The cost of caring for a Medicare patient far outpaces the reimbursement that physicians receive for seeing them. On top of that, the expense of providing care continues to rise due to medical inflation. This inflation, coupled with declining reimbursement rates, creates enormous financial pressures on physicians, forcing many to retire early, stop accepting new Medicare patients, or sell out to larger, consolidated hospital systems, private equity, or even insurance companies.\"\n\nMurphy said the future of private practice medicine is at stake. Policies such as Medicare awarding higher payments and inflationary increases to hospitals, but not to physicians, has led to a rapid decline in private practices. In cardiology for example, private practices employed about 90% of physicians, but that has eroded to about 12% today. He said private practices are the most cost-efficient and enable the most personalized care for patients. \"This bipartisan legislation prevents further cuts, provides a modest inflationary adjustment to help ease the cost of care, and ensures Medicare remains viable for both doctors and patients,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"Over the past 22 years, adjusting for inflation, physicians have essentially taken a 26% pay cut from Medicare,\" said [Congresswoman Kim Schrier, MD](https://schrier.house.gov/about), (D-Washington) a pediatrician, said in a statement. \"Their reimbursement has been flat or declining, while overhead costs have increased by about 47% for rent, labor, equipment and insurance. I cannot think of another profession whose compensation has dropped by 26% over two decades. Physicians have been holding their breath, year after year, hoping that Congress will act to avert these devastating decreases in reimbursement. Without adequate reimbursement, solo and small practice physicians—most often in rural or underserved areas—are already closing their doors.\"\n\n# March deadline approaches to reverse Medicare cuts\n\nThe AMA said the next legislative chance to reverse the Jan. 1 Medicare cuts comes in mid-March, which is the deadline for the 119th Congress to fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year. At the end of 2024, The AMA said the 118th Congress passed a scaled-back resolution to keep the government running amid a very politically charged lame-duck session. The AMA said the language that would have stopped the physician Medicare payment cut was removed from the bill.\n\nThe [AMA said it strongly supports the legislation ](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/new-congress-same-legislative-focus-fix-medicare-now)and is working with members of Congress to meet that deadline. The group is also asking members to call their members of Congress in support of the bill, and to attend the \"Fix Medicare Now” event the AMA is hosting on Capitol Hill Feb. 11, where physicians are invited to wear their white coats.\n\n\"We are using this bill...to help position ourselves in the best possible way to be in that \\[March\\] package to reverse as much of the cuts as possible and to try to get an update,” explained [Jason Marino, AMA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-marino-525355173/) director of Congressional affairs said during a recent webinar. “We need to tell the story about the rural practice on the verge of closing because of these cuts. And they can’t afford to see Medicare patients. I’ve heard some stories from physicians that aren’t even taking a salary. They’re keeping the practice open by not taking a salary because the medical payments are going for their staff and technology. They’re not getting paid. But that’s not sustainable.”\n\n# Medical societies applaud effort to stop Medicare cuts\n\nMedical societies responded positively to the bill and said stopping payment cuts and keeping up with inflation would go a log way to improving Medicare patient care, rather than causing frustration and forcing doctors and health systems to make tough choices.\n\n\"The [Medical Group Management Association (MGMA)](https://www.mgma.com/) urges swift passage of the Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act of 2025. Physician practices are now a month into the new year, facing uncertainty and financial shortfalls from the congressional failure to reverse the 2025 Medicare fee schedule cuts,\" explained [Anders Gilberg, MGMA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersgilberg/) senior vice president, government affairs in a statement. \"These cuts have negatively impacted the viability of their Medicare business, commercial contracts tied to Medicare rates, as well as Medicaid reimbursement in states that use Medicare as a benchmark. With nearly 80% of all physicians now employed by facilities and larger entities, Medicare beneficiaries in areas of the country that rely solely on community-based medical practices are especially vulnerable to access issues. Without immediate congressional action on this important legislation, more and more physician practices will be forced to close their doors.”\n\n\"The [American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC)](https://www.asnc.org/) is urging Congress to take action, as declining reimbursement and the absence of inflationary updates pose grave challenges to physician practices,” said ASNC President [Panithaya Chareonthaitawee, MD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chareonthaitawee-panithaya-m-d/bio-20053255), in a statement. “According to CMS, practice costs are projected to rise 3.5 percent this year. Physicians must have increased financial stability to continue providing care to patients.”\n\n# Physician members of Congress understand the impact of Medicare cuts\n\nThe concerns shared by the AMA, MGMA and other medical associations are being echoed by several congressional co-sponsors.\n\n\"The bipartisan Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act is crucial to reversing the damaging trend of cuts that threaten our healthcare providers, especially in underserved communities. We must act now to prevent further early retirement, burnout and consolidation,\" said [Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks, MD](https://millermeeks.house.gov/about), (R-Iowa) an ophthalmologist, in a statement.\n\n\"Physicians, unlike the rest of the players in healthcare, have never received an inflationary update and consistently received cuts. This bill ensures a more stable Medicare payment system, allowing providers to focus on delivering care rather than worrying about losing their practice. With this bipartisan effort, we are working toward a system that supports both doctors and patients,\" said [Congressman Ami Bera, MD](https://bera.house.gov/about/), (D-California) a doctor of internal medicine and former health system administrator, in a statement.\n\n\"After yet another cut to the physician fee schedule, more physicians will be forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see, or in some cases, shutter their doors. This will result in a lack of access to care for many Medicare beneficiaries. While the price to administer high-quality care has continued to rise over the last 20 years, the Medicare reimbursement rate for physicians has continued to drop,\" explained [Congressman John Joyce, MD](https://johnjoyce.house.gov/about), (R-Pennsylvania) a dermatologist, in a statement.\n\n\"Rising costs and administrative burdens make it clear that Medicare reimbursement policies must reflect the true costs of providing care,\" said [Congressman Raul Ruiz, MD](https://ruiz.house.gov/about/biography), (D-California) an an emergency room doctor, in a statement.\n\n[https://healthexec.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-policy/congressional-bill-could-reverse-medicare-cuts-and-increase-physician-pay](https://healthexec.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-policy/congressional-bill-could-reverse-medicare-cuts-and-increase-physician-pay)",

    "title": "15 Years of financial tracking through medical school, residency, fellowship, and attendinghood (UPDATE #11)",
    "text": "Hi all,  \n\nI’ve made a number of financially-focused posts starting 6 years ago as a new hospital-employed interventional pain management attending. [Past posts and large Q&amp;As can be seen in my post history.](https://www.reddit.com/user/DrPayItBack/submitted/) I have said that I would continue to provide updates and answer questions as I made progress on my financial goals. Much of this will be carried over from previous entries so that each post can stand on its own, but I have edited anything relevant.\n  \n**I graduated medical school in 2014 with $160k in loans (about $210,000 in 2024 dollars), which was just about the median at the time. Clearly average loan burden is higher now. I am also in pain management which is generally a well-compensated field. I make about 40th percentile for my specialty because I am an employee and work reasonable hours, but it is still more than many physicians. Finally, I lost my dad unexpectedly in mid-2020 and therefore received an approximately $200k inheritance. In my opinion, all this does not change the principles of smart financial management, though it is certainly accelerating the timeframe. But if you feel these factors trump all else, you may not get much out of the rest of the post. This is not an exhaustive list of my privileges, but I always try to put them front and center.**  \n  \nI have been an attending now for 6 years. I work essentially business hours, 7:30a-4:00p, no nights, weekends, holidays, or call. I spend 2 days per week in clinic and 3 in the fluoro suite. In addition to holidays and weekends I get 7 weeks (35 business days) off per year, 2 weeks of which is for CME.  \n  \nAs in the past, my major goal has been to show one person’s attempt to put the framework of smart physician personal finance into practice a la resources like the [White Coat Investor](https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com). **I have never held myself up either as an ideal, just a real-world example of what it can look like when you’re trying to do the ‘right thing’.**  \n  \nOver the years my goals have shifted from student loan payoff to home ownership to now thinking about when stepping back from clinical medicine might be possible and what that might look like. I do not have any solid goals for early retirement, but I would like to be work-optional by my early 50s (empty nest) and currently feel about on track for that. I have mused about going to 0.9 or 0.8 FTE. We’ll see.  \n  \nTo repeat my prior posts, I’ve been tracking my income, spending, budget, and net worth since starting medical school in 2010.   \n  \n**Basic Stats**  \n* I took out about $160k in medical school loans (equivalent to about $215k in 2025 dollars) and graduated in 2014. This was a very different time in terms of tuition, and I was helped by going to a public in-state school and a few need-based grants. I got married in 2014 as well, and our overall debt (student loans, cars, and credit cards) was $225k when I graduated (or about $300k in 2025 dollars).  \n* I started off residency putting some money towards loans every month and was able to get them down to around $200k. I did have a 403b match at my residency program so I contributed enough to max this, and I tried to contribute to a Roth IRA when I could. My wife was working as well. With the birth of our first kid in 2017 we started treading water financially.   \n* Fellowship pushed things further down, between my wife going stay-at-home, an unexpected car replacement, and probably overall less disciplined spending since the ‘light at the end of the tunnel’ was so close. I maxed out our Roth IRAs, but otherwise did not save at all. I did not have a work retirement plan available.  \n* Salary during my five years of GME training was $55-65k in medium cost-of-living cities. My wife worked for the first four of those years, bringing home $40-45k.  \n* We now are in a relatively low cost-of-living city. Base salary at my current job is $420,000. I receive an annual bonus which is generally around $20,000 for total comp of around $440,000.  \n* My wife works very part time bringing in $10-20k/year pre-tax.  \n* We finishing paying off my student loans in December 2022, after about 3.5 years as an attending.  \n  \n**Income and Spending**  \n  \nIn typical year given ~$450,000 pre-tax income, about $125,000 will go to taxes, $140,000 will go to spending, and $185,000 to savings. I have started taking my foot off the savings pedal ever so slightly this year, allowing our spending to drift up by approximately the inflation rate. I max out my 403b, 457, and our Roth IRAs each year. I put $8,000 per child into a 529 annually, and contribute $7,000 per month to a taxable account (this was $10,000/month until this year).   \n  \nSince I became an attending 6 years ago, we have increased our net worth by **$1,855,000**, or an average of **$26,500 per month** over 70 months. Approximately $200,000 of this unfortunately came from an inheritance from my father between 2020-2021, but it is mostly a reflection of consistent saving and investing and maintenance of a reasonable lifestyle. Coming out of training it took us 10 months to go from a net worth low of -$156,000 to $0, with significant continued gains in 2020 and 2021. We remained about even in 2022, between the market pullback, buying a house, and getting a new car. In 2023 and 2024 things really began to skyrocket, with a combined gain of nearly $800,000. 2025 has unsurprisingly been much more volatile and I expect this to continue for the next few years.  \n  \n**Disability Insurance**  \nI purchased an individual own-occupation disability insurance policy from Ameritas near the end of my residency training. The initial benefit was $5,000/month for a premium of $178/month. When I signed my attending contract at the end of fellowship, I exercised the future-increase rider that I had purchased and increased this to a benefit of $15,000/month for a premium of $472/month. This is a little bit more expensive than it might otherwise have been since I was over 30 when I bought the policy, and I have a couple minor chronic conditions. Like all disability insurance purchased with post-tax dollars, this payout would be tax-free at the time of disbursement.  \n  \nYou want disability insurance to afford a decent (not necessarily ideal) standard of living, and to allow for saving for retirement. Long-term disability will not pay out after age 65, so this has to be considered. For our current level of spending and our ability to make discretionary cuts if needed, the $180,000 per year post-tax benefit should allow for this. Because of the own-occupation rider I would also be allowed to work in another occupation without reducing my benefit. Disability (and life) insurance are most important in early career, given low assets, high debt, and a long runway of future potential earnings. As you build up your own stash (and have fewer years to work/live!), they become less important and can eventually be canceled.   \n  \n**Life Insurance**  \nI have three separate individual term life insurance policies, plus what is offered by my work. I use a laddering strategy, so I have three separate policies $1,000,000 each at 10 years, 20 years, and 30 years. This way my life insurance coverage phases out as I become less and less likely to need it due to accumulation of savings. For this I pay a combined $186/month, again a little higher because of some chronic conditions. The first policy will phase out in 2030. In addition to this I have a $1,000,000 policy offered through my work for pennies each month, for a grand total of $4,000,000, or a little shy of 10x my base salary.  \n  \nWe have a $500,000 20-year policy for my wife at $17/month, and she also gets a $50,000 policy through my work. She is stay-at-home, but there would obviously be increased childcare expenses if anything were to happen to her.  \n  \n**Auto Insurance**  \nThrough Progressive. We pay $97/month for two vehicles, 2016 and 2021 model years. We plan to replace cars every 5-10 years. \n  \n**Umbrella Insurance**  \nThrough Progressive. We pay $20/month for $1,000,000 in coverage. I plan to increase this to $2,000,000 at some point (though I say this every year). There’s no hard and fast rule for how much to carry, but most people seem to use an amount that approximates net worth.  \n  \n**Housing**  \nFor the first 3 years of my attending job, we rented a house for $1,850/month plus utilities. We bought a house in summer 2022 with a purchase price of $635,000, and we financed with 10% down on a physician mortgage at a 4.00% interest rate. Our timing didn’t get us the rock bottom for rates, but we squeaked in under the wire before they really started skyrocketing. Total monthly payment is $3,580, and $2,730 is the mortgage itself. We used Truist and the experience was just okay. It felt like I had to micromanage quite a bit, but ultimately we got through the process with no major hiccups.\n  \nWhether to rent or buy is a common topic for trainees and new attendings. I generally subscribe to the idea that you should be 100% positive that you will be there for several years to even consider buying, like a longer residency or after the first few years of a job once you’ve made sure it’s a fit. Looking back we almost certainly would have come out ahead if we had bought straight away in 2019, but it would have been a terrifying time with COVID and not knowing if I was going to keep my job or have to sell at a loss. And I certainly wouldn’t have a $1,000,000+ investment portfolio.  \n  \n**Student Loans**  \nI refinanced a portion of my student loans (federal loans that were unsubsidized, with a higher interest rate) with Laurel Road (formerly DRB) during residency. I refinanced to a variable rate at ~4%, down from the federal rate of 6.8%. This variable rate went up and down but mostly stayed about the same. At the end of fellowship I refinanced again with Earnest, this time the entirety of my student debt. I took a 5-year term with a variable interest rate at 2.5%. For 2.5 years it only went down, and it bottomed out at 0.16% for much of 2021. In 2022 it climbed back up again to around 4%, which is where it was when I paid it off. I refinanced my wife’s graduate school debt at around the same time, also to a variable rate 5-year term. I paid off her loans in a lump sum in early November 2021. At no point did I have loans affected by the interest/payment pause, and we would have been considerably better off if I had just never refinanced them, but that’s water under the bridge.  \n  \n**Savings**  \nWe use Ally which I have been very happy with. We typically have an emergency fund of ~$30-35k, which would cover about 3 months of expenses. In addition to this I have started filling sinking funds for house and auto, so I get less irritated when periodic expenses come up.  \n  \n**Investing**  \nOur investments include my 403b, non-governmental 457, and Roth IRA, my wife’s solo 401k and Roth IRA, a taxable brokerage, as well as 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs for our two boys. Our kids were used in advertising for my wife’s business when it was getting off the ground, which allowed her to employ them and contribute to the IRAs. We are not actively contributing to the custodial IRAs at the moment.  \n  \nAcross the retirement accounts and the taxable brokerage, our asset allocation is 63% US stocks, 18% international stocks, 10% US bonds, and 9% REITs. All in low-cost index funds. The 529 accounts and custodial Roth IRAs are in 100% US stock funds. Focus is on low cost, broad, passive funds. I do not have any holdings in direct real estate or syndications currently.  \n  \nI do have a smattering of cryptocurrency, a total of $10,000 principal, or ~1% of our investments. After going down to a low of $3,000, it’s most recently back up to about $20,000 or 100% gain. I still think it’s stupid.  \n  \n**Estate Planning**  \nWe have a living trust, wills, powers of attorney, and health care directives. I did these online with a company that did a good job (as confirmed by an attorney friend), but I think they no longer exist and we will probably just go with an in-person attorney next time we revise documents.   \n  \n**JUST SHOW ME THE CHART**  \nOverall, this is what the journey has looked like to date:  \nhttps://drpayitback.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/reddit-NW-Trend-Jun25.png  \nFor the purposes of this chart, I have netted out our mortgage (home value minus remaining mortgage = equity as an asset).  \n\nFor the few of you that have further interest, I previously kept a blog [HERE](https://drpayitback.com) with a huge back-catalogue of posts though sparsely updated these days and I am probably going to let the hosting lapse very soon.  \n\nHappy to answer any questions, either pertaining to this post or previous ones, have a great day and good luck on July 1!",

Yes, I'll probably cross EM off the list unless it really calls to me in M4 (which from y'alls experience, sounds like it probably won't)\n\nSo I was super into ophtho but recently thinking about EM. Can someone fill me in here and whether I'm missing something here? Sounds like an absolute steal, I don't get why its not more popular??\n\nPros:\n\n* Great income (300k up to 500k, comparable to ROAD??)\n* Shiftwork, can be great lifestyle outside of medicine (40-50 hrs a week for shifts or even lower)\n* No call, once you leave the ED your life is yours\n* Jack of all trades, get to \"save\" lives and do super cool shit including a decent amount of procedures\n* Great for advocacy and helping the super marginalized populations (homeless, immigrants) as well as can influence policy since you're at forefront of medicine. I can work in policy on the side with shift-work (can reduce shifts and hours generally are super good per week) - something I'm super passionate about\n* 3 year residency (compared to retina ophtho for me which was gonna be 6 yrs)\n\nCons:\n\n* I get that burnout is real but something I'm willing to deal with\n* Night shifts and weekend shifts (also think I'd do great here, already like to work during late night anyways)\n* Concern with mid-level encroachment and private equity but thats also a problem for other specialties too honestly\n\nI worked in the ED in college and found it manageable. Am I missing something here? This sounds like a great career where you can make up a lot of money comparable to ROAD and other high paying specialties.

You’ll forget details fast.\n\n3-Think about your priorities , not just prestige. Do you value research, lifestyle, strong clinical exposure, or supportive culture?\n\n4-Clinical volume &amp; case mix really shape your learning , high-volume hospitals = more experience.\n\n4-Pay attention to mentorship and culture , toxic vibes or lack of support can ruin even a big-name program.\n\n5-Don’t ignore salary + cost of living. A $70k salary in NYC ≠ $70k in a smaller city.\n\n6-If diversity, inclusion, or work-life balance matter to you , factor that in too.",

    "text": "Hey there! My US indigent DPC practice brings in less than $400 a month and doesn't get any grants. I have no assistants and practice solo, living humbly off my spouse's junior-level computer science salary so I can put any money I do get back into helping folks.\n\nThis is almost impossible to do in this day and age, so I wanted to start a thread for tools that have made it possible for me to cut costs and survive.\n\n**MAKING THINGS FREE FOR YOU AND YOUR PATIENTS**\n\nFREE E-PRESCRIBING:\n\n\\-ENavvi!!! I am so excited about this! Took me less than 20 minutes to set up my profile and they let you compare cash prices so my underinsured/uninsured patients can work with me to pick what and where! They work with the Mark Cuban pharmacy I think (which has also helped me cut patient costs, as has GoodRx)\n\n\\-Push Health--also really excited about this, but still waiting on profile verification (they require your NPDB self-query uploaded, too).\n\n\\-Doximity efax (for a long time I had no e-prescribe option - I would save a fax profile for each patient's preferred pharmacy, and if I couldn't find a number online, I'd just call the pharmacy, say \"my electronic system's down, can I get your fax number,\" and save it)\n\n\\-WENO is a competing standard to Surescripts and offered me a very good discount (like $90 a year, it just isn't better than free); I highly recommend escaping Surescripts' monopoly if you can...\n\nFREE AI NOTE SCRIBING:\n\n\\-Dorascribe.ai gives you 20 free notes a month, listening in to your conversations and formulating a SOAP note (and doesn't seem that expensive after, but I'm only using the free notes); \\*\\*\\*EDIT: OMG DORASCRIBE IS AMAZING. It formats my note so beautifully, it listens to my whole AP as I'm explaining it to my patient--AGH. I hope they win out over the other AI software folks because they are SO good. And for a lot of doctors, $89/month is not bad. I still can't swing it but HOT DAMN.\n\n\\-InsightHealth was mentioned in the comments as unlimited free (but maybe less accurate)\n\nWhen my Dorascribe runs out, I use,\n\n\\-Vibe is a free local transcribing LLM I run on my computer that can generate a transcription of my conversation in English or Spanish from the live talk with the patient, which I can then:\n\n1. Feed to the other local LLM I run through Msty to generate a note from the transcription in my style (I have tested a bunch, I've seen clinical data saying llama3OpenBioLLM-8B is good but I haven't had a chance to run it and there are always resource limitations since some will just explode your computer; there's a list of top LLMs in medicine on huggingface, but so far I've only had okay results with llama-3.1-8b-claude-3.7-sonnet-reasoning-distilled, I am using the Q8\\_0-1744846109832:latest on my gaming laptop. The benefit to using local LLMs is you're not sharing HIPAA data anywhere)\n\nor\n\n2. Quickly de-identify in notepad (search replace patient's name--important because ChatGPT isn't HIPAA compliant) and ask ChatGPT to copy my medical note style and generate a SOAP.\n\nAlways have to read over the generated note to make sure nothing stupid or untoward is happening, but this is faster than me writing it out forever, since my notes tend to be VERY DETAILED.\n\nAs a bonus, I use AI to help me generate personalized patient handouts based on newer research and guidelines I've found that sometimes don't make it into the standard handouts you find floating around.\n\nFREE EHR STORAGE\n\nThis is harder because of the BAA you need to protect your butt from HIPAA leakage issues.\n\n\\-Supposedly telemed from emedpractice com has a free EHR (I need to talk to them about getting an account).\n\n\\-Google Workspaces will provide you a BAA to guarantee HIPAA compliance, but only in their paid version (although...I have seen no difference in their paid or unpaid Gmail...so who knows about storage).\n\n\\-After scolding Icedrive for a long time about how their encryption supposedly meets technical standards so please just write me a f'king BAA so I can use them, I gave up and have resorted to using my own local NAS server run on QNAP. They're built for HIPAA compliance and will help you configure a build if you need help. It's mine, I have no business agreement with anyone, no one handles the data but me, and it doesn't leave the building unless I'm sending a link to a patient to connect directly TO my server to get their records. Mine was $800 for the hardware and took a while to configure, but because it's local and protected with other measures (physical included) it's more secure than using any paid service. And in the long run, much cheaper than paying per month. I'm able to make a folder directly on my computer that looks like a native folder in Windows, and just make documents in it as if it were a normal folder on my laptop. I use Tailscale on it so I can access the server while traveling (SOC2 compliant, used to create HIPAA compliance in other applications) and FileStation5 to send patients their data.\n\nIt means I can't get a fancy patient-facing system, but I have patients decide verbally on a password during their visits so it isn't stored anywhere online\\* and when I save their note after each visit I email them the link to access their data. It's just one extra step. They all sign an agreement up front that email is not secure, and that we will not send health data over email but rather use encrypted links. I always send them a visit summary in that note package so they have diet, exercise, and other health recommendations based on what we talked about--I give them a digital \"to do\" list, basically. So they get at least as good (if not better) quality documentation access than they'd get with a standard EHR.\n\nAnother benefit to this is I can use my notes formatted in Word with my logo and my practice style.\n\n\\*I have most of my patients' passwords memorized (is a tiny practice) but I could save a .txt with their passwords into the secured server if I needed to; they still can't retrieve it if they lose or forget it though, and need to call or text me for it elsewhere.\n\n\\-Kind of in this category, Guavahealth was mentioned below and seems to be a great way to help your patients keep records with you and be more proactive\n\nFREE PRACTICE LOCATION (ish)\n\nI do old-timey home visits, health fairs (street medicine), and telehealth only.\n\nFor telehealth, I'm running doxy.me's free service. I would love to get a little practice van I could drive from place to place (like a Sprinter, which is what I have in the other country where I work). Someone below mentioned govt surplus for vans, which sounds sweet.\n\nI have to use a service for mail, since I don't want my house listed somewhere. I currently use ipostal and physicaladdress.com. Not free, but cheap.\n\nORDERING LABS WHEN YOU CAN'T DRAW IN-HOUSE\n\n\\-Ultalabtests.com was recommended below as cutting lab costs by 50% for patients!\n\n\\-I have an account with Labcorp and send the patient out. This is the only thing I do that really requires their insurance info, but they give that to Labcorp, not me.\n\n\\-Options I haven't tried yet: I could also sign up for Quest and Rupa, and there are services that make labs cheaper that I haven't used yet--I wanted to mention that [Walkinlab.com](http://Walkinlab.com) looks promising for my patients who find Labcorp expensive, or for drawing up labs myself, which especially for certain sexual health items, I would like to start doing (Labcorp is very confused about how/why men who have sex with men might need anal HPV testing or GCC and doesn't have a simple code for ordering this, for example).\n\nCHEAPER PROCEDURES, IMAGING, AND SPECIALISTS\n\n\\-Greenimaging.net makes expensive imaging a lot cheaper; I would love to hear of more ways to make this more affordable for patients\n\n\\-mdsave.com is a way to help your patients save on procedures. I used to do Nexplanons and IUDs, which are impossible for me now because of how much the device itself costs. It seems, however, that it's possible to do reduced-cost procedure mapping through mdsave.com.\n\n\\-Opentelemed.org operates the Swinfen system where you can get free specialist advice for charity cases--I don't know the limits of this and wish I also had a cheap specialist network for patients who aren't indigent but want to opt out of insurance for moral reasons. So far I only know to send moral opt-outs or underinsured patients to networks like Medishare, Samaritan's Purse, and [Joincrowdhealth.com](http://Joincrowdhealth.com) to find help paying for specialists if the local hospitals cost too much.\n\n\\-I have a POCUS machine, and when I need a more advanced image than I can obtain myself, I have been able to tap someone from the local prolife pregnancy center to lend me a hand for free (whatever your feelings on abortion, these centers do more for free than anyone else in most geographical areas and are usually glad to help charities if they've got a sonographer on hand; they may also donate a POCUS machine to you if you are a charity)\n\n\\-https://www.stdcheck.com/std-test-pricing.php will decrease bundle STD pricing costs--still pretty pricey and there are usually Title X clinics you can send your patients to. I have on occasion sent a patient to Planned Parenthood for free STD testing. They did know the protocol for specialized gonorrhea and HPV testing for males who have sex with males better than other sites I'd tried. Had some patients report getting kind of \"cold\" care there, so for those who want a more personal touch (or maybe have moral reservations about the corporation itself) some local pregnancy centers are doing these tests for free now and they tend to have warmer, more trauma-informed visit rooms because a lot double as counseling rooms. Look up Carenet STD testing. Someone below said PP does imaging as well, but as far as I know their official policy is that they do not guarantee they will be free (and my ten years of sexual health and pregnancy care experience has been at most sites they do not offer them at all). But I KNOW Carenet does free ectopic screening (Choices in Fredericksburg, VA does that, for example).\n\nMORE RESOURCES FOR FREE (OR CHEAP DPC) CLINICS:\n\n\\-Free clinic starting charity clinic guidebook is here: [https://nafcclinics.org/get-involved/start-a-clinic/](https://nafcclinics.org/get-involved/start-a-clinic/)\n\n\\-States where you can practice free telehealth across state lines: [https://pacificlegal.org/30-states-telehealth-rules/](https://pacificlegal.org/30-states-telehealth-rules/)\n\n\\-Faith-based free clinic support (Christian): [cchf.org](http://cchf.org)\n\nI really, really hope this helps someone. I want to bump these tools in search because with all these greedy over-charging jackalopes buying search placements, these were almost impossible for me to find for years. I know I wish I had a list like this when I got started. And I still hope people with more experience than I do will add to it.\n\nHow do you cut costs for your patients and yourself?",

I definitely had some thoughts about \"oh why do people complain\" but once I got the *post taxes* check, yeah, I 1000% understand why people complain. That website salary is meaningless lol. The post tax one really, really gets you. For more over the table workers, this probably isn't new for you.

This is due to reductions in work and practice expense RVUs. Please see the Impact on CY 2026 Payment for Selected Procedures table.\n\nThey’re also cutting reimbursements for YAGs, eye codes and E/M codes for established pts\n\nOphtho has already been the target for significant reimbursement cuts in the last decades, I fear the next few years will see even more cuts.\n\nJust an example: The most common ophtho procedure cataracts - Since 2018, simple cataract surgery has seen a 20.5% cut and complex cataracts has seen a 33% cut. Further cutting these rates is insanity and will significantly reduce private practice and public ophtho salaries.\n\nEdit: I'd highly suggest reading the ophthalmologist reactions to this on the linked r/Ophthalmology post.

    "title": "Spouse changes mind, not joining me for residency.",
    "text": "Long post alert—\n\nI’m a 4th year med student, preparing to match this March. While I’m excited to be almost complete with medical school, my spouse just informed me: \"BTW, If you don’t match near my hometown, I will visit you on the weekends. I’m going back home.”\n\nThis is mainly motivated by their desire to return to their old job prior to moving after we got married in late 2022. We’ve been Together since late 2020. Ever since i started medical school in 2021, I’ve been continuously communicative regarding the unpredictable nature of The Match. They repeatedly told me, \"It will all work out and we'll cross that bridge when we get there.\" We went through premarital (and intramarital) counseling in which I mentioned that I also want them to be fulfilled in their life/career apart from me. Never wanted them to feel like they HAD to commit to me and my med school journey. Granted, jobs in their career field are ubiquitous. (Let’s just say, they will never have trouble finding a job. ) I further communicated that I didn’t want  them to resent our relationship if we didn’t live in their desired region. After all, They have to be happy too, with or without me! \n\nThey said they were committed to me and our relationship— regardless of my job or where we lived. Said they were willing to move wherever. Ultimately, we got married and they have been supportive since Day 1.\n\n I’ve applied to programs near their hometown. However, the majority of my interviews have been in other parts of the Nation. It’s not looking like I’ll match near their hometown, although I’m confident that I’ll match somewhere. (My specialty is quite competitive so, I’ll be grateful to go anywhere) \n\nLong story short, I feel somewhat betrayed since I thought that we were in this together.  Needless to say, I feel quite blindsided. \n\nI'm not interested in a long distance marriage and I'm upset that they changed their mind since the reality of matching elsewhere is settling in. I honestly think my spouse is most happy when they are with family, friends, at their old job, and in the familiarity of their home city. It appears that they are happily married, but the reality of being away from their family is undesirable. (But what about us, our little family of 2?)  It seems that they ultimately want to be married but live in their comfort zone. Looking for advice on moving forward and other perspectives. \n\nTL;DR— Spouse tells me 1 month before the match that they will not be accompanying me to residency, although that’s what was originally communicated. Feels like a bait and switch. Unsure how to move forward. \n\nEdit: we’re talking to our therapist about this in a couple of weeks. Thanks for all of your invaluable feedback. I’m hurt but hopeful that we’ll find a solution, hopefully sooner rather than later. \n\nEdit 2: some people are suggesting that we must have marriage issues since we see a counselor. Not necessarily. We touch base with our therapist every 6 months as a “maintenance therapy.” It was suggested by both of our parents before we got married. At least for the first few years of marriage. I’ve enjoyed it since, marriage is a huge life transition that often requires discussing the victories and losses with a professional. \nBottom line— it’s obvious that their desires changed at some point in the process. I’m accepting that and navigating as appropriate. Thanks guys ",

    "title": "a pleasant surprise - New York Times made a great article about DO's today! :^)",
    "text": "***Full article below:***\n\n\"By most measures, osteopathic medicine is a profession in its prime.\n\nThe number of doctors of osteopathic medicine, or D.O.s, has grown 70 percent in the last decade and is expected to continue expanding.\n\nMore than a quarter of all medical students in the United States are training to become D.O.s, thanks in part to limited slots in traditional medical schools and ever-growing openings at osteopathic schools (14 campuses have opened in the last five years).\nAnd in recent years, the field has gained prestige as its doctors have risen to the highest medical posts in the country: leading top medical systems, overseeing NASA’s medical team, running the most followed medical page on social media and, during the last three administrations, overseeing the medical care of the president of the United States.\n\n“I do think we are — I don’t want to say infiltrating — but we are everywhere,” said Dr. Teresa A. Hubka, the president of the American Osteopathic Association.\nYet the changing face of medicine has largely been invisible to the public. Beyond vague notions that D.O.s are more holistic, or stereotypes that they were rejected from traditional medical schools, very few patients know how a D.O.’s training might shape their health care. One of the most commonly searched questions on Google about D.O.s, who have had full rights to practice medicine in the United States since 1973, is whether they are physicians.\n\nOver the course of Dr. Christina Weaver’s career as an osteopathic doctor, she has been mistaken for a “bone doctor” (orthopedist), a homeopath (an alternative healer with no medical degree) and a chiropractor (also no medical degree).\n\nMany patients do not even realize their doctor is a D.O. unless they happen to see the degree hanging on the wall, said Norman Gevitz, a sociologist who has written a book and dozens of publications about the field of osteopathic medicine. (This includes his own mother, who did not know what a D.O. was even after he dedicated a book on the subject to her.)\n\nThe difference between a D.O. and M.D. used to be far more obvious. In 1874, when a disillusioned Civil War physician, Dr. Andrew Still, invented osteopathy, it was meant to exist in sharp contrast to the harsh mainstream medical practices of the time, which included bloodletting and prescribing toxic doses of mercury.\n\nHis philosophy asserted that most ailments were a result of misalignment, mainly in the spine, that he could heal by physically adjusting the bones and joints rather than prescribing medications. His methods quickly gained popularity as word spread of Dr. Still’s “miraculous” healing abilities.\n\nDr. Still began training new providers at his school in Missouri, to the outrage of many M.D.s. Those doctors regarded osteopaths as “members of a cult” and aggressively fought to shut down the profession with lawsuits and legislative pressure.\n\nBut over the next century, the rift between the two medical philosophies began to narrow as osteopaths began prescribing medications and practicing surgery. By the mid-1970s, D.O.s were licensed physicians in all 50 states.\n\nToday, the distinction between D.O.s and M.D.s is much fuzzier. D.O.s still attend separate medical schools, but their curriculum covers much of the same ground, and many take the same board exams.\nAs of 2020, D.O.s and M.D.s attend the same residency programs, where doctors get hands-on training in their chosen specialty.\n\n“I think we’re more the same than we are different,” said Dr. Weaver, an associate dean at A.T. Still University’s School of Osteopathic Medicine in Arizona.\n\nAnd despite lingering stigma about osteopathic medicine (the comedian Hasan Minhaj has likened D.O.s to the off-brand soda RC Cola), research has found no significant differences between the professions when it comes to hospital readmissions, death after hospitalizations, surgery outcomes or other patient metrics.\n\nWhile vestiges from Dr. Still’s original philosophy are still incorporated into modern training — students spend roughly 200 hours learning a hands-on approach for diagnosing and treating various ailments called osteopathic manipulative treatment — most D.O.s say they don’t use these techniques.\n\nDr. Anita Skariah, a primary care provider at UNC Health in North Carolina, said a D.O.’s more holistic approach to care, that is, asking about a patient’s life stressors, or nutrition, might once have distinguished her from her M.D. colleagues.\n\nBut even that has faded as more medical institutions recognize that social factors and lifestyle can shape a person’s health. “I can’t say that it’s unique to me anymore,” she said.\n\nWhat has remained distinct is where D.O.s work: disproportionately in rural areas, and in primary care practices. Today, nearly 60 percent of D.O.s are primary care providers, a far greater share than those with M.D.s, and osteopathic medical schools produce many more rural doctors than M.D. programs.\n\nThe reason for this difference depends on who you ask. One explanation, often offered by M.D.s, is that primary-care training programs have higher acceptance rates than those for higher paid specialties, like surgery or anesthesiology, and jobs in rural markets are less competitive.\n\nBut many D.O.s say that caring for communities that have been historically neglected by the medical establishment is a central part of the osteopathic philosophy. This is evidenced by the fact that most osteopathic medical schools were built in rural or “medically underserved” areas, like Kirksville, Mo.; Harrogate, Tenn.; and Detroit.\n\nDefining what makes osteopathic medicine distinct is more than an academic exercise, it’s an existential problem for osteopathic medicine.\n\n“Without that sense of distinctiveness, the profession may die from within,” said Dr. Gevitz.\n\nAs it stands, the United States is the only developed country that trains two separate professions to act as fully licensed physicians. And stand-alone osteopathic hospitals and residency programs have already been absorbed into M.D. institutions, Dr. Gevitz noted. He said that D.O. medical schools or even the degree itself could one day be completely overtaken by traditional medical degrees.\n\nDr. John Licciardone, a researcher at the University of North Texas’ Health Science Center who has published several papers on the profession, doubts that many rank-and-file D.O.s would care about being lumped together with their M.D. peers. As the field has expanded, more and more doctors of osteopathic medicine seem perfectly content to not stand out from the crowd, he said: “They just want to be a physician.”\n\n- Teddy Rosenbluth, Times Reporter",

I was attacked once by a patient who tried to stab me with a glass shard because the govt didn’t think it was necessary to offer security services with in the premises.

I really enjoy the times I get to think about lab values, differentials, pathophys, diagnosis, treatment plans, etc but that is dwarfed by the amount of time I spend reaching out to consultants/case managers, answering endless epic chats, endless chart reviewing, putting in orders, writing notes, getting people to do their jobs (“hey why aren’t those stat labs I ordered 3 hours ago collected?”) etc. I feel more like an overqualified scribe/secretary than I do a doctor half the time. I’m getting more efficient with everything but it’s still tedious and unrewarding.\n\nAnyway time for another 13 hour shift",

    "text": "I wrote the below as a counterpoint to a doom/gloom message posted earlier today and then deleted. Every word I say below is true. I can’t speak for you but I picked the entirely correct profession for me, and it has rewarded me handsomely, in both personal satisfaction and personal finance.\n\n**TL;DR: Medicine doomers have always existed, and seem to take special glee in destroying students’ enthusiasm for the career. Don’t buy into their misery.**\n\nI have practiced for 27 years, many as a specialist (bet you can guess which). I have made good money every year and gone to bed each night knowing that I made the world a tiny bit better. I have worked in places with imperfect but generally quite good administrators who have treated me very fairly. As I write this, I am a salaried employee, paid well above the average for my specialty, and I am not on any kind of production/RVU goal system—in fact, I never have been other than some prior “pooled goals” for our hospital based practice that were very easy to reach.\n\nWhen I was in medical school (mid-90s), everyone told us how HMOs and capitated reimbursement models were taking over the world, and that Medicare would cut reimbursements so dramatically that we would eventually be paid the same as professions with significantly less training. Not only did that not happen, the exact opposite occurred and over the course of the next 20 years, compensation for my specialty more than doubled, even when adjusted for inflation. \n\nJust posting this to say that it is not all terrible out here, particularly if you are ok not living directly in a big city (I am just an hour away). For most specialties, there is a huge supply/demand imbalance that tilts negotiations heavily in our direction. \n\nAs is the case everywhere, on the internet the unhappy people have the loudest and most amplified voices. The bitterest words often reveal more about their author than about the state of our chosen profession. With some time and patience, literally anyone in medicine can carve out a good niche. \n\nDon’t believe the anti-hype! ",

Putting this under vent because I'm sure a lot of us will have strong and emotionally-charged opinions (including me) on this topic but I was originally going to put it under discussion.\n\nWe all know how the public only looks at the attending salary and thinks \"doctors are paid too much!\" The first line of explanation is usually that because of the high cost of medical education, student loans, and opportunity cost associated with med school and residency, etc, compared to the average white/gold collar worker. The question I'm struggling to answer convincingly is what if someone asks in response \"so what?\" Like people can say \"sure but that you're willing to be in 400k in debt doesn't justify how you're paid 300k+/year\" or \"if you were in it for the right reasons, you wouldn't care about all that.\" How would you respond to this?",

The rent is reasonable being about $1500/month including utilities. However, with this recent news, I was wondering if it would be better to stay at home and help my dad pay the mortgage and other expenses as I'm able. \n\nMy resident salary will be about $60k pre-tax and it obviously can't cover everything but I feel like I would be wasting money on a place of my own when I could help my parents out while I have a decent living situation at home aside from the commute time.

They take a low starting salary in hopes of staying in a physician owned practice for the eventual ownership and autonomy. What's the motivation behind these senior partners selling out? Is it purely financial? It would seem to me that if they were targeted for acquisition they were likely already doing well and partners probably have saved millions in the bank - at least enough to live nicely and retire well.

We love Canada (especially Québec as we speak French) and have always joked around with the idea of moving to Canada. With our current political climate and the outlook of our country we are doubting more and more whether we actually want to raise kids in this country and are considering moving to Canada. Right now we are both full-time physicians but can both likely switch to part-time work in the next 1-2 years (even if Canadian salaries are lower and taxes are higher). We're also both ~~witch doctors~~ DO's in case that matters (but have board certifications with the MD boards).\n\nSince it seems like the major way physicians get Canadian residence/citizenship is via the express entry for professionals, what exactly is the expectation for work there?\n\nDo I have to already have a job lined up or do I have to agree to work a specific # of years in Canada? Seems like 3-5 years of residence to get citizenship, but not sure about work.\n\nDo I have to be a full-time physician or can I just residence/citizenship even if I only plan on being part-time and never full-time again?\n\nAre hospitalist gigs relatively easy to get or would that be a big challenge to find?\n\nAlternatively, would it be feasible for me to work full-time and have my wife not work at all for this citizenship/residence process?\n\nTheir immigration website is helpful but does not address a lot of the nitty gritty fine details.

    "text": "I’m a physician in Brazil. I completed a clerkship last year and I’m planning to take Step 1 this year.\n\nMany doctors in Brazil are now seeing the USMLE as a way to escape the oversaturation of physicians that has been growing in the country. This saturation really started around 2023 — before that, it wasn’t discussed much — but now the number of medical schools has more than doubled, and we’re seeing unemployed doctors.\n\nI’m one of many in this wave pursuing the USMLE. But I’ve noticed that a lot of us are going down this path without truly understanding what the job market is like in the U.S. for foreign-trained physicians.\n\nWe’re seeing that many U.S. states are starting to ease laws, allowing international doctors to work without doing residency in the U.S., sometimes even without having taken the USMLE Steps. On top of that, most states are increasing the number of residency positions as part of government plans.\n\nWhen I talk to Brazilian doctors about this, most think it’s not a problem. They believe that doctors in the U.S. earn very well, and that this is a kind of safety net.\n\nBut no one is actually living there, seeing the real market and the changes happening.\n\nSo I want to ask you, as American doctors:\n\t•\tDo you think the quality of life for doctors in the U.S. is declining or is going to decline in the coming years?\n\t•\tCould the growing number of immigrant physicians, many accepting lower salaries and tougher working conditions, eventually hurt the system and devalue U.S.-trained physicians?\n\t•\tAre these new laws allowing more foreign doctors — even those who aren’t ECFMG-certified — going to damage the job market long-term, or am I just being overly pessimistic?\n\nI’m planning to apply for residency in Florida in the next 2–4 years.\n\nI really appreciate your opinion!

    "title": "I left surgical residency",
    "text": "\rSo I feel like I've seen a lot of posts related to this over the years. In all honesty, I was definitely looking for a post that would explain how I would feel if I left residency and pursued something else. I didn't find that post, but I think that's because you have to figure it out for yourself. So… This is my contribution to the \"I left surgical residency\" page. \n\n  \nI feel like I probably should've known this early off in medical school, but it was almost at that time that I was trying to prove something to myself. I began my third year, clerkship, and anticipated that I would most likely go into a surgical field. In fact, I set up my clerkship schedule to allow me to have surgery in the middle so that it might improve my chances of the team taking me seriously when I stated that I wanted to go into surgery. I'll never forget the first day going into the OR, I was so overwhelmed with the entire space, and wanting to do well that I basically broke down. I was so nervous to make a mistake that I was unable to suture a 5 mm port sites closed. As I ventured through the remaining half of my surgical rotation, I kept pushing myself to get over this anxiety. I was nervous, and I was scared to go into the operating room, due to the magnitude of what I believed an error would make, but I continue to push through. At the end of my rotation, I remember feeling incredibly tired, and as if I lost a good portion of my life; but I still wanted to pursue the field. What a weird feeling. \n\nAs I went through the rest of my third year, I noticed that my quality of life drastically improved over additional rotations. I also could tolerate other rotations more than I anticipated, but I never had that epiphany that I was going to pursue another field. So, I decided to pursue 4th year electives in surgery and did several. During this time, I realized a lot of my fellow classmates going  into additional fields had a much more time during their fourth year, which should have been another hint to my future. Fast forward to match day, I matched. It was all kind of a shock and this whole experience might even deserve another post. \n\nAnyway, I started residency and to be honest, did enjoy the start. I had incredible residents and as they say now “the vibes were there”. I was working hard and staying late. I understood the workflow and got notes completed and made my way into the OR many times. The funny thing is on the outside it looked perfect. I was advancing and doing well; but deeper I still had that anxiety in the OR. I think a lot of it came from perfectionism but it was exhausting. The job was exhausting. I had nothing else but the job, and as I progressed throughout the junior years, the job took so much from me. It would demand me to be up for 30 hours. The constant pages, the ongoing calls, the admin work, the need to study and get better…. It was exhausting; and the thing is…. I didn’t see it get better for my attendings. They were still fielding calls. They were there late at night when cases went late. They were there in the ER. They were there all the time.\n\nI started to become a bad version of myself. This is how I knew I had to leave. \n\nSo, I left. I found a position outside the match, had hard conversations with some people and moved to a new program. Overall, it’s been interesting. Do I regret it? No. Has it come with its own challenges? Yes. I think the hardest part is going from a place that you have established yourself to a place that you don’t know anything. Relearning how to do things and where things are was challenging. Finally, I think the hardest part has been giving up my identity as a “surgeon”. In fact, I’m convinced that many people stay in the field because they like this identity. Anyway, at the end of the day, it’s a job, and if it’s making you become a worse version of yourself, then I would argue it’s not worth it. \n\nHappy to answer questions! ",

    "title": "Update: residency termination",
    "text": "1 year ago, I was terminated from residency. I was overwhelmed with responses to my post, and with all the PMs and related post I still see today, feel compelled to make an update for everyone.  \n  \nTo start, I will say that this was one of the most difficult things I had ever faced. After making my post, I took care of my mental health exclusively for almost a month. I plead that anyone going through this takes care of themselves foremost. To fight an appeal, you need to show insight and growth. To land a new residency or job, you need to find your strengths and purpose. Many of the times seeking help will look positive, especially before signing any documents. I did do an appeal. It took over a month and concluded unsuccessfully. In my experience, I found things to be a combination of highly formal-legal but also more personal than I expected. What I mean by this is the committee does seem to appreciate personal statements showing reflection, insight, growth, and potential to finish. Formally, they really care that the procedures were followed correctly and appropriately. I did talk to 1-2 lawyers initially, and in a similar vein to what I observed, they had laid heavily into gathering all data to 1) show that procedure was followed incorrectly, 2) show times I was misguided, discriminated, intimidated, or disadvantaged, and 3) indicate positive remarks, evaluations, or have testimonials specifically by BE/BC attendings (I got resident support and they basically wiped their bum with it). I did not get a lawyer, but I can see the value if you had a good case (despite the heavy costs). I hear many people do recommend them, and it seems like the more successful attempts are ones where various violations exist and/or you get an attending to stand up for you. For me, overcoming the documentation trail they made against me during the learning plan / probation / termination was proving to be way too hard. Combined with the stress, being late to fight my case, lack of money, and working, I was not in a position to fight. The fortunate side of the appeal was learning/finding/sifting out the faculty who actually support me and will write me LOR in the end. Looking back if I could change things, I would advise taking the first \"learning plan\" with utmost seriousness. Get down to who (do I need to impress better, gain support from, meet with, etc) and what (are we defining the problems as, needs to change, happen, and/or prove) I need to do to survive X years. Also documenting better helps, though it probably would not have changed my outcome, at least for yourself to track your progress and what seems to work. I also wish I moved on sooner after the appeal as the success rate is really low.  \nFor me, it was actually a relief to fail my appeal as I could finally move on. I decided that I wanted to complete a residency training program and be BE/BC (you'll see why as you read further). But it is a stressful question to ask yourself where you want to go next.  \n\\- Short disclaimer of my bias: I was intending on a shorter-term job in the interim before residency, with the goal being next cycle. Most of my apps were on LinkedIn (especially in the non-clinical section, except for the teaching), but I started to move to personal websites and email after tons of failures. Also, for those of you following my previous post, no I did not ultimately pursue work outside the USA or go for NP/PA/nurse lol.  \n  \n\\- The \"clinical path\" was where I started, the tribal medicine, correctional, rural clinic, urgent care, Medicare in-home visits, etc jobs . For my controversial perspective, in my experience, non-BE/BC clinical jobs essentially no longer exist. I 've applied to so so so many with nearly 100% denials. With only my resume showing my training background, they would respond that \"I was underqualified\" as I was not BE/BC. Even firms took me off their lists. I was (and technically still am) on the call list for wound care training/openings in a whole US region. That being said, only 2 things did happen. I did get a LinkedIn nursing home job, and without going into detail, it  was incredibly sketch and didn't work out to say the least. The experience looked positive on a resume so it worked overall in my favor despite things, and Uber paid the bills. After that, I got a job in clinical research through cold calling every clinical research site/clinic in the state. I highly recommend clinical research especially for those seeking ERAs. Next, as far as other non-physician jobs. I hear the assistant physicians is a great opportunity but this is not in my state and deeply hope more advocacy goes into this. Otherwise as far as non-physician clinical jobs, I had applied to about 50-100 jobs with lower requirements. I lived through weeks of getting denied CNA, MA, phlebotomy, various tech, and lab jobs while working Uber. Like way overqualified you would think, but they also said I was underqualified. Maybe some of you have different experiences with the above and I would love to hear more.  \n\\- For the \"non-clinical path\", I applied to 100+ after leaving the nursing home. I sent very few MSL jobs (no responses, admittedly I did not tailor my resume well for it), no admin jobs (felt underqualified), few utilization jobs (no response but also did not tailor my app for it), no government/CDC jobs (great route but felt like a very long term career). But, I did try for some others. Pharmacovigilance seems like a wonderful career option, I tried a range of them on only LinkedIn with no success. I also applied to a few medical writing or reviewer or etc and actually did get a few leads and IVs. Tons of education jobs denied me, including tutoring SAT/MCAT/USMLE or with children (oversaturated and my scores were only higher-mid, or poor pay) and teacher/professor (was too short term or not a PhD, despite my years of teaching experience). Wyzant actually has me temporarily banned because they are oversaturated. Non-clinical research I got some leads on too. Overall my impression was that there are great options and I know there are a number of big advocates for these such as LeavingMedicine, physician side gigs, and the Facebook page for physician non-clinical careers. My other impression is that networking and applying beyond LinkedIn is essential. They are legit careers and you need to put a strong foot forward in being a good candidate and earnestly applying to one or two for any to work. IMO doing any of them is at least something, which is at least a start whether for a residency or a bigger career.  \n\\- Personal/professional development (outside of job/career) was something I wanted to also touch on.Especially if your goal is residency / ERAs, I recommend a convincing story of growth overall, and you need LORs. Starting with letters, you need specialty-specific letters and experience to match, exception maybe being prev/occ health if you have a background/reasonable story. Finding opportunities really felt like a networking game. My success in this regard was mostly through my medical school self-named mentor list, cold emails had little/no success, except the emails to public health clinics for prev/occ. I would reach out to old friends, residents, attendings if possible, your school, and any connection you can think of. My medical school also got me resources for 1) a list of mentors of all specialties I could contact, 2) Match data and on the 3rd year medical student match emails/checklists, 3) my transcripts (these need updated FYI), and 4) a vague list of alternative careers. Personally, pathology open doors for me. I set up shadowing, fell in love, and the rest is history. I can speak and help more on pathology if anyone needs. Perhaps my biggest overall advice for letters is regarding PD support. From what I have heard/seen, a resident's chances of matching are near 0% without decent or better support. If you are leaving or thinking about leaving, the advice I've gotten and now give is to really really really try to do everything in a way that garners PD support. Hopefully you have good rapport or can build it. Perhaps try to slowly edge in that another specialty may be your calling, but of course be truthful. Finally, regarding my overall story, professionally and personally, and other general tips. I found it was helpful to had first realized what my problem(s) were. Not only personally, but also figuring out what your PDs narrative of it is and ensuring it aligns (especially when it comes time to interview). Then, find ways to materialize your personal development of your weaknesses on paper. For example, I struggled to speak as a confident leader and being decisional. So I joined Toastmasters, where I learned to be organized, a leader, and confident. I also did some exercise classes and competitions to develop my skills of acting on the fly. These were clear stories on paper.  \n  \nMy final paragraph I want to talk about ERAs submission and interviewing. I think switching specialties worked in my favor. There is naturally a lot of pushback from many letter writers of your lost specialty, especially the PD, since on paper at the end of the day you lost a spot in that specialty. I could tell my program writers felt better about me switching. They could instead support strengths they feel apply to this other specialty and could minimize weaknesses to be specialty-specific issues. I also think the switch was to my benefit because it played into my commitment to the new specialty. That is, to say I want to rededicate X years towards something totally new exclusively. My last key point is about how huge framing is huge. That is, using your experience as a positive. Being able to talk about growth from what happened and why it will make you the best doctor, and how you nailed down your weaknesses to be able to succeed with 100% certainty this time. I had probably 10+ mentor meetings about how to frame. Last to mention as it is frequently asked. I did pay for both FindAResident and ResidentSwap. I sent 50+ applications to every non-surgical specialty PGY1-2. I would say I heard back from &lt;20%. Ultimately, my PD did not support me starting until after attempting an ERAs cycle, which was why it was not mentioned before. So the few hits I got went dead. I will say, for this route, you need EVERYTHING ready just like you would be hitting submit on ERAS. Including letters and all. They are going relatively fast. I know there are some discords and stuff for this. I think this is the paved route if you can pull this off.  \n  \nI hope this was helpful. This was a very condensed version, so feel free to PM me anytime and share resources and your experiences to me or in comments. Happy to chat more.",

I think the underlying science and medicine of IM can be some of the most interesting stuff in the world, but the practice of it is painful to me at this point. I almost chose IM cause the medicine can be so interesting and comprehensive, but intern year has me thanking the old gods and the new that I only have a year of this.\n\nI’d say my biggest gripe with it is how little medicine a day in internal medicine can have. This may be my bias as an intern tasked with doing all the scut, but I feel like only 30% of my time (at best) is spent actually using my MD and the knowledge that I worked hard to get. I really enjoy the times I get to think about lab values, differentials, pathophys, diagnosis, treatment plans, etc but that is dwarfed by the amount of time I spend reaching out to consultants/case managers, answering endless epic chats, endless chart reviewing, putting in orders, writing notes, getting people to do their jobs (“hey why aren’t those stat labs I ordered 3 hours ago collected?”) etc. I feel more like an overqualified scribe/secretary than I do a doctor half the time. I’m getting more efficient with everything but it’s still tedious and unrewarding.\n\nAnyway time for another 13 hour shift",

I also have this fear of being screened out of programs because of my step 1 score, which I’ve been told will likely happen regardless of chief year or not.

    "text": "Last month Fiance who is in the same residency (FM) broke up with me. Residency has been difficult (as it is for almost anyone) and I became more secluded. I was terrible at communicating. I have 2 therapist i'm working with to improve my mental health. Another issue was that I did not want to start a family immediately and wait closer to the end of residency.\n\nWe've worked together since the breakup and it's been really awkward.... as expected. Mentally I try to compare it to working with colleagues who I don't necessarily get along with but remain professional. Which helps me get through the day.\n\nWe've kept it on the low but since I am moving out in the next month it has become obvious. The Ex is looking for a new roommate and so am I and we've each posted on our respective cohorts chat advertising that we are looking for roomates.\n\nIn terms of my performance as a resident...I can say it has improved since the break-up since i'm just focusing on studying, my research/projects and gym more than before.\n\nNow there are 2 issues. I am specifically at this program because of my ex. I was ranked high enough to match on my own merit but was basically guaranteed a spot because of my ex. The faculty, many staff members,and colleagues know i'm here because of my ex. Hindsight is 20/20 but if I were to have ranked my programs independently this specific program would NOT have been my number 1. So now I feel like a dummy.\n\nThe other issue, i'm just trying to figure out how to talk to other colleague without making it more awkward. There has been other extracurricular activities by colleagues that have caused a divided in our program already. We have 36 resident (12 per cohort), so it a good size program and faculty take a huge interest in our personal lives (some are even known to gossip extensively). My 1 week vacation ended this week so I've had time to gather myself and I assume that at the very least all our colleagues know by now.  \nIf anyone else has been in a similar situation, I would appreciate further advice.",

    "text": "IM prelim here who matched DR at a great program after really struggling with their specialty choice for a long time. I was between EM, IM, Anesthesia (all with likely a critical care fellowship), and DR. I narrowed it down to anesthesia vs DR and decided on DR 2 weeks before apps were due. I ultimately chose DR for a number of reasons including the vast knowledge base of both common stuff and zebras, focus on diagnosis, being the “doctors doctor”, ability to work from home, lack of mid level encroachment, compensation, and the humane (albeit long) training among other things. I did two radiology rotations and even though I sat there doing nothing, I found it fascinating. Now that I’ve matched, have started residency, and am looking at 5-6 more years of training I’m naturally praying I made the right decision. I think the hard part of radiology is unlike some specialties, you can’t really get a feel for what it’s actually like as a medical student. It’s not like IM or something where you can see patients, come up with plans, call consults on them, etc as a medical student. I think you have to wait for residency to know if radiology is actually right for you. It kind of takes lots of self reflection and a leap of faith to decide on it in my opinion.\n\nSo rads peeps, at what point in training did you know you made the right or wrong choice?\n\nP.S. A few months of intern year has solidified that I feel meh about patient interaction and don't think I'll miss it terribly in radiology. Also while I think the medicine in IM can be very interesting, I hate the practice of it. ",
