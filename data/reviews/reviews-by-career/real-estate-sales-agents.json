    "text": "Last week, I asked in this sub how to teach real estate to my daughter's class who are 7-8 years old.\n\nMy daughter's teacher asked me to talk to their class regarding real estate. They are writing a paper and there's a real estate portion. They are 7/8 years old so I had to make sure I made it entertaining for them.\n\nThanks to your suggestions - I said that when buying a house, it's like a treasure hunt for the best home. I also told them that realtors are magicians because we can open any realtor lockbox in the area with our phone apps.\n\nDuring the discussion, they learned how to write a cheque and buy and sell houses in different provinces of Canada (currently, they're learning provinces and territories of Canada, they're learning to write in cursive, learn to write #s in words, learn about money which I integrated in writing a cheque). \n\nAt the end of the class, I gave each one of them a certificate that says they're Real Estate Superstar. I signed the certificate with my name on it. I was in their class for 1 hour.\n\nWhen my daughter went home, I received a book of the compilation of the kids' dream home. Most of their dream homes are castles, with pool, with tree house. It's their way of saying thank you to me. But that's not all, \n\nA parent contacted me. They're already pre-approved for financing to buy a home - the next day, we were looking at $1.2 - $1.4M homes and few days later, found the one and already has an accepted offer.\n\nAt this point, I don't see anything is gonna go wrong in our deal - clients are preapproved for much more $ (actually, they can pay cash if they want to so financing will never be an issue), house is built by a reputable builder in 2021 and the price - we got it as a deal - most listings in this area are $100k-$200k more - comparables were $50k-$100k above our accepted offer. My clients were willing to pay the asking price, I offered way less and after back and forth, our offer got accepted. \n\nEDIT: house is officially off market :) we got it! ",

Then they list with someone else. It happens every time. You’ll beg for referrals, knock doors, cold call, and still hear “no” more than “yes.”\n\nYou’re not selling houses.

    "title": "I had an unrepresented Buyer ask for 9% in Closing Costs 😂 and threatened me 😬",
    "text": "I haven't really seen an uptick in Buyers reaching out directly on my listings, but when I do most of them have simple questions and almost all \"Just want to see the house\" and expect me to show it on their timeframe. I obtain permission from all my sellers ahead of time, in writing, to qualify an unrepresented Buyer before the seller allows the showing, especially if it's owner occupied. A seller isn't going to just leave to allow someone \"just looking\" to go through their home. \n\nSo I get a call, guy wants to see my 650k listing. Gives me his name, offers proof of funds ahead of time. Great! We set up a time to view the property, it's vacant. A couple days later he calls me before the showing. \n\n\"Hey I'm interested in the home but I feel it's overpriced based on my research.\" I tell him OK, what research and data do you have access to? It's been on market less than a week with 4 showings. Of course a home is only worth what someone is willing to pay, so tell me, in your opinion what is the value? He replies with\" Probably around $550,000 based on my research. \"\n\nAt this point I realize it's not necessarily worth my effort to continue to further educate him. I politely tell him, that unfortunately his opinion is wrong, based on my decade of experience and with local comps we're actually priced 2.5% under those comps. That I'm anticipating an offer from one of the 4 showings and he hasn't even seen the property yet to determine condition or if he likes it. \n\nHe replies \"I've seen enough online, I'd like to offer $550,000 and ask for 9% in Closing costs, with 3% of that being the Realtor Commission back to me\". \n\nAt this point I have a decision, I can discontinue the call and call my seller or have a bit of fun. So I have a bit of fun. \n\nOh thank you for the verbal offer, unfortunately seller, per our written contract will only review offers in writing. Additionally they will only review offers from people who have seen the property. Also it is illegal to pay a non licensed individual a commission and unless you are purchasing with an FHA/VA Loan you're capped at 6% In closing Costs generally. Also you sent me proof of funds and said you would be cash. \n\n\"Oh no, that's the statement from my father, we have the same name. I would be financing. You have to present my offer to the Seller.\"\n\nOk so you provided me proof of funds under false pretenses to see my Sellers home? Also you apparently have either received bad advice or no advice and it doesn't sound like you've spoken with a lender to understand your limits within financing. At this time I think it best to advise you to seek proper representation and without a valid approval we won't be showing you the property, per my seller instruction. \n\nIt's at this time he loses his mind 😂 \" You can't stop me from seeing it, I'll call your seller directly, you're just a greedy ba****** and I'll report you. \n\nI end the call by telling him I have no duty to him, maybe he should educate himself and based on his temper I would no longer feel comfortable meeting him. (I've been assaulted). Wished him the best and disconnected. \n\nDude called my broker and my broker told me he almost had to call the cops because the guy threatened to break into my sellers house. \n\nPeople are crazy. But it amazes me the extent some people believe they know better than us. ",

    "title": "Thinking of Becoming a Realtor? Here's the Ugly Truth (From Someone in the Trenches)",
    "text": "Let me save you some time and heartache. If you’re thinking of becoming a Realtor because you saw someone on Instagram driving a G-Wagon and holding a “Just Sold” sign, pump the brakes. I’ve been in this business for a few years now and I’m here to give you the unfiltered, no-BS version of what this career is really like.\n\n1. 80% of new agents are gone within 2 years.\nWhy? Because this isn’t a job—it’s a business. There’s no salary, no sick days, no health insurance. It’s commission-only, which means if you don’t close, you don’t eat. Most people don’t have the discipline, savings, or stomach for that.\n\n2. Nobody trusts you in the beginning.\nYour friends and family will say they support you—until they list with someone else. It hurts, and it happens more than you think. You have to prove yourself before anyone gives you a shot, which means cold calling, door knocking, begging for referrals, and hearing “no” more times than you can count.\n\n3. You're not selling homes—you're running a full-blown business.\nYou’re the marketer, the social media manager, the customer service rep, the negotiator, the transaction coordinator, the accountant, and more. If you don’t have the money to outsource those tasks, guess what? You’re doing all of them. And most of your day will be spent doing everything except showing homes.\n\n4. It takes months (sometimes years) to make consistent money.\nLet’s say you do get a listing. Congrats. You’ll work your ass off staging it, marketing it, holding open houses, then it sells… and you get paid maybe 45 days later. That one check? It needs to last, because you might not close another deal for a while.\n\n5. Your time is never your own.\nForget weekends. Forget holidays. Forget relaxing nights. Buyers and sellers want your attention on their schedule. And if you’re not responsive? They’ll move on to the next agent who is. Real estate doesn’t care about your work-life balance.\n\n6. The emotional rollercoaster is savage.\nYou’ll spend months nurturing a client who ghosts you at the last second. You’ll get into escrow only to have it fall apart days before closing. You’ll have to be a therapist, a firefighter, and a miracle worker—daily.\n\n7. The market is oversaturated.\nEveryone and their cousin is a Realtor now. There are 1.5+ million agents in the U.S., and only a small percentage of them are doing meaningful volume. It’s a noisy, hyper-competitive space where people will undercut you just to get a listing.\n\n8. And here’s the kicker: AI is coming for all the weak agents.\nIf you think this job is about opening doors and filling out contracts, you’re already replaceable. AI is getting better by the day—automating paperwork, analyzing property data, writing listing descriptions, and even doing showings virtually. In a few years, the agents who bring no unique value, no deep market knowledge, and no people skills will be gone. Tech doesn’t need sleep, it doesn’t take a commission, and it doesn’t forget to follow up.\n\nSo if you’re thinking of jumping into this thinking it’s quick money, easy sales, or a “fun” job—don’t. This business is a meat grinder, and most of you won’t make it.\n\nBut if you’re obsessed with real estate, resilient as hell, and willing to sacrifice time, money, and comfort to build something real? Then maybe—just maybe—you’ve got a shot.\n\nFor everyone else, stick to watching Selling Sunset. It’s safer.\n\n—A tired Realtor who’s still in the game (for now)",

    "title": "When I pulled a listing on the day it was supposed to go live (and why it was the right call)",
    "text": "Just had the craziest experience I need to share in case it ever happens to you. Longtime lurker but this was too wild not to post.\n\nSo I got a call last week from this sweet elderly couple wanting to sell their home of 40+ years. Classic story - downsizing, moving closer to grandkids, etc. The house was a beautiful mid-century in an area that's absolutely blowing up right now.\n\nHere's where it gets weird. When I went for the initial walk-through, the husband (let's call him Frank) was super friendly but his wife (we'll say Martha) seemed really hesitant. Like, she'd agree to everything but I could tell something was off.\n\nFast forward to listing day. I'm there early to stage a few things and Martha pulls me aside looking totally stressed. Turns out, she didn't want to sell AT ALL. Frank had basically steamrolled her into it because their kids thought it was \"time.\" The poor woman was in tears talking about her garden and how all her memories were in that house.\n\nI made a call I've never made before - I pulled the listing THAT MORNING. Told Frank we needed to talk. The three of us sat down and I basically mediated their first real conversation about this move in months.\n\nTurns out, they could actually afford to keep the house AND get a small condo near the grandkids (they had way more equity than they realized). Frank just assumed selling was the only option because \"that's what old people do.\"\n\nLong story short - they're now my clients for buying a small vacation property instead, Martha gets to keep her garden, and I actually ended up with a more profitable commission structure in the end.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: Sometimes your job isn't just to sell houses, it's to make sure your clients are actually making the right decision. I could have pushed forward and made a quick commission on a hot property, but I'd have hated myself for it.\n\nAnyone else ever have to pump the brakes on a listing that was technically \"ready to go\" but just felt wrong?",

What they're really purchasing is their own story. \"We found this incredible property that wasn't even on the market\" hits different than \"we bought it off Zillow.\"\n\nThe weird secret? Sometimes the $10M clients are easier than the $500k ones. They're usually crazy busy and just want you to handle everything. No 2am texts about cabinet hardware. No Sunday morning panic calls about anythinggg.\n\nBut here's the trap: Don't get comfortable just because they're wealthy. Had a $4M deal fall apart last week because another agent gave them a \"better story\" about a different property. These clients aren't buying shelter they're buying an experience.\n\nAnyone else notice this pattern with luxury clients The psychology is fascinating.",

I just wanted to share a personal story of a listing I had this year that just wasn’t moving.\n\nIt was priced right, staged, had good photos, went on the MLS, and got shared on Instagram. Still, barely any traction (if any). To be honest the location was a solid 3/10 - but the development was pretty bueno.\n\nFor this listing I didn’t want waste weekends hosting open houses that brought in the same unqualified buyers.\n\nSo I thought of something new.\n\nAt my brokers open, I hired one videographer. But instead of just filming my own video like always, I invited other agents to create theirs too, for FREE.\n\nEach broker got a chance to appear on camera, use one of a few short scripts I prepared, and walk away with a professional video they could post on their own social media.\n\nThey got new content, and my listing got ten extra videos shared across different audiences. No paid ads, no begging for views.\n\nMost of them had never made a real estate video before, so it turned into a fun, collaborative thing 😄. And the property FINALLY got attention and managed to get a few showings in the same week.\n\nIf you have a listing that has gone quiet, this might be worth trying, because it worked for my listing!\n\nLet me know if you ever tried this or if you would give it a shot.",

This is a very nice building in a world-famous location, not the nicest building in the zip code, but enviable for sure. Units range from $600k-$2mm. \n\nI met these buyers two years ago when they came to one of my listings in the building. We got to know each other, and then they made a joke of an offer which my seller and I couldn’t take seriously. Nothing came of that. \n\n——fast forwarding here—— \n\nLast month, a unit in the building that was under contract had their deal fall apart. They dropped the price to a shockingly low number to move it quickly. \n\nWe went to go look at it, and they demanded to make an offer on it that any reasonable person would be insulted by. 20% below list when the property is already listed at a very low number. Of course the listing agent called and chewed me out, angry he had to present it, sellers were pissed, blah blah blah. \n\nEventually, I got my buyers up to a number that I deemed acceptable to present, still too low, but only because I was willing to cut my commission request to the seller, which made the offer seem sort of acceptable. \n\nAfter a week of fine tuning the terms, the sellers accepted our deal and I woke up to an acceptance today. \n\nWe went into the unit today, and my buyers couldn’t stop saying awful, terrible things about the sellers. For no reason. I was so fucking livid that these people were so ungrateful, not to mention the stress I’ve gone through this past week. They were able to take advantage of the sellers situation to buy the property below market value, and the husband did nothing but complain when they are beyond lucky to get it for this price. \n\nI wanted to throw him off the balcony.

    "title": "2 year client wants 40% of my commission",
    "text": "I am dealing with an incredibly annoying/dense client who is under contract, two weeks from closing my biggest deal. I have been working with this client for 2 years. He chose to work with me because I’m in his community and he heard good things about me (his words). \n\nWhen we started working together he kept reiterating that he was very relaxed who was fairly on top of the market and would only require showings if he couldn’t get to an open house. I was glad to hear it especially because his search is over an hour away from where I live but thought it was unnecessary as I was happy to show him homes as quickly as they were available to view.  \n\nEvery aspect of getting him to offer something reasonable was like pulling teeth, he argued with me about every little thing. I kept calm and explained to him that his offers were weak and he most likely wouldn’t be considered. He did not believe me but after the 14th failed offer he started to wonder if it was because we were POC, my brokerage, my age and gender. I put my foot down and I told him I would be more aggressive on my opinion since he was starting to blame me and my calm attitude was not getting through to him. Some people need to be yelled at or experience an alpha I guess… \n\n2 years in, 16 offers, over 50 showings with him and his poorly behaved children who I watched over like a babysitter because he and his wife couldn’t be bothered to keep an eye on them. The hours on hours I spent driving for these showings and with this client on the phone to give him my professional advice and opinion on price strategies, best terms to offer and explaining what highest and best meant over and over again was all finally is worth something because we are under contract. \n\nHe has switched loan officers 4 times to get the best offer. Completely wasted my preferred lender’s time for 7 months, luckily the lender knows his reputation for being a professional time waster. Harassed his lawyer and me nonstop during A/I in the late evenings and weekends for answers that we were simply waiting for response on. This guy lacks boundaries or awareness of how this all works but refuses to comprehend when taught. \n\nHe has a request for me now that we are finally out of A/I. He wants 40% of my commission. I audibly laughed on the phone when he asked. It was a reflex but I was shocked. He then went down to 13.5%. I told him I would give him a flat payment (I would typically give this to a client as a GIFT for way less due to the amount of time and effort I have put in) of .5% of my commission. He argued with me over this for quite some time and I’m disgusted. It’s insulting and I have never “given” my clients money back this way. He feels it’s fair to ask since he wasn’t “that much work” and he claims that his previous realtor gave him a similar amount. I wonder why he isn’t working with that guy if he gave him close to half of his commission. \n\nHe said he was giving me a chance as a new young realtor. I’ve been doing this for 4 years and this is one of 4 closings I have scheduled for the month of November. \n\nI’m inclined to offer .5% one last time and let him know it’s only as a courtesy. Take it or leave it but we aren’t arguing or talking about this again. \n\nI recognize that this is an important lesson for me and I have this client for a reason. It’s to make me a stronger realtor. I’m curious if any of you have had to navigate a situation like this and what you did.\n\nFor numbers, this is about $20k commission, after split and tax I’m looking at $13k take home ",

I’ve been grinding non-stop for two months, showing hundreds of houses, spending over $1,000 in gas, paying $200/month in desk fees, plus $500 up front. I’ve had zero income during this time and was finally about to close my first deal — or so I thought.\n\nI had two clients interested in the same rental, but because of multiple representation rules, my boss told me I had to hand one off to another agent in the office. I agreed, trying to be professional and follow the rules, and gave the second client to a colleague.\n\nThis client had already seen over 10 homes with me. I built the relationship. I scheduled every showing. I did all the driving. I handled the documents. I kept the deal alive. I gave this client to her on a silver platter.\n\nMy boss told me to make sure I asked for a 50/50 split. I forgot to mention it. That’s on me. But I truly didn’t expect another agent, who closes multiple deals a month, to just take the full commission without saying a word.

    "text": "Hi everyone!  I’m a real estate agent in Brazil and our market works *very* differently compared to the US. I’d love to share a few facts that usually surprise international agents, and I’m curious about your reactions.\n\nHere are some realities of how things often work here:\n\n* Exclusive listings are rare — the same property is usually listed with multiple agents.\n* There’s no true MLS system, so agents spend a lot of time “hunting” for listings and confirming availability directly.\n* **There’s no concept of a “buyer’s agent.”** Agents mainly represent the seller, and buyers often just reach out to whoever has the listing. Because of this, the competition to *capture and mantain listings* is extremely fierce.\n* Clients often contact several agents at once for the same property.\n* 🚨 **For new condo developments:** agents do “sales shifts” at the developer’s stand. Shifts are 8 hours long, no salary, only commission (\\~1.5%).\n* At these stands, there can be 30+ agents from different brokerages working together. Potential buyers who walk in are assigned by a *daily lottery system*. If you’re unlucky and get the last spot in the draw, you might spend the whole day without speaking to a single client.\n\nI’m gathering reactions to these differences to create content for my Instagram, showing how real estate practices vary around the world.\n\n👉 If you reply, please note that I may share your comment (translated) on Instagram. If you’d like to be credited, include your u/handle so I can tag you.\n\nHow would you feel working in a market like this? What do you think would be the hardest part?",

    "text": "I was a realtor on a team 2022 to 2023. I did their showings for a portion of the team leaders’ commissions and worked on my own deals. 2023-2024 I left and moved abroad. When I came back, right away the team approached me to come back, and have done so multiple times at this point. They offered to give me buyers, but the split was 50/50, and then I’d split my 50% with Keller Williams, which would take another 36% of my cut initially. I said no.\n\nNow, they approached me again and are pleading with me to come back, because they’re moving from Philly to Florida in June and want to split all of their clients between me and another agent on the team. The terms are better now, with it being 50/50 for their leads and 70/30 for me own clients I bring in. They’re switching brokerages so now I’ll only have to pay $500 per transaction from my cut as far as I understand.\n\nI did the math, and they did 60 deals and $550-600k in commission the last year. If business doesn’t slow down, my cut would be around $100-125k (not counting anyone I bring in).\n\nAm I stupid for turning this down? I am 26 years old and I’m flattered that they’re turning down the other candidates and trying to get me, but I know for a fact that I don’t want to be a full-time realtor until I retire. I absolutely hate the on-call lifestyle. Had to spend Easter Sunday doing last minute showings, and they decided not to buy, which was not great lol. I’m good with people and have always been good at the job, but I want to pursue another career, which would definitely take an initial pay cut (the starting salary would be $50,000). My biggest concern is that I take the deal for the money and then lose the years of building up another career.\n\nDo you think it would be better to take the money for now and see how it goes or turn them down?

    "text": "I got my license right out of high school and have been at the same brokerage since. It split from KW around that time and became independent. I started on a 50/50 split for my first 10 deals, then moved off that after my first year.\n\nBack then, training was great—one of the owners was a killer salesperson and led most of it. But after a falling out, he was bought out about 3 years ago, and training quality tanked. We absorbed another brokerage, but the brokers we got in return don’t do any personal business and basically coast on salary. One of them is also our “productivity coach,” but honestly, he's terrible.\n\nThe current owner is solid—closes 50–80 deals a year and makes time for us—but his style isn’t replicable, so the training isn’t that useful. Recently, one of our top producers tried to help by running office-wide training since morale was low. But when they tried to figure out how to pay him, the brokerage lowballed him to keep paying the existing coach. They ended up copying his methods anyway, but the quality dropped.\n\nThe comp structure also changed:\n\n* **Old (Partner Plan)**: 70/30 split, $24K cap, Realtorcom leads, paid sign installs, E&amp;O, listing photos, RedX, CoStar (just me, since I cold call), TC, and training (though it was already getting weak).\n* **Now**: 80/20 split, $25K cap, no leads, no sign installs, no listing photos. Still includes E&amp;O, TC, RedX, CoStar, training (still bad), plus free printing and paper for flyers/mailers.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know I’m the one who has to make the calls, but the energy in the office sucks. I’m 22 and usually in the top 10 agents, only doing around $6M a year, but most people do their own thing. That gets tiring, especially when you're the only one door knocking or cold calling. I also feel like I shouldn't be top 10 in the brokerage with the volume Im doing I feel like we don't have enough high producers and the ones that are high producers our opinions arent valued when we share them and I feel like if there was more comradery and more top producers the brokerage wouldn't be changing up the training all the time cause we would know what works. VS rn the brokerage we absorbed was failing and now it feels like we're getting bullshit training.\n\nThis was the only brokerage I interviewed with, and at the time it felt like the right fit. But with everything that’s changed, I’m not so sure anymore. I guess I just needed to vent—but I’m also wondering if I’m being realistic or falling into “grass is greener” thinking.\n\n  \nAlso the shitty part about leaving is I have a CRM full of around 1k leads that I generated myself through door knkcing and cold calling. I have a few listings and buyers with signed contracts and all of those would stay with the brokerage. So yeah...\n\n  \nWhat would you do if you were me? I'm in UT if that helps. ",

I was told I would be strategy, and be earning salary + a down line from others brought on after me who would be commission only and focused on recruiting.\n\nAfter some time it became apparent the broker who brought me on has no idea how any of the tech actually works in the backend and wanted me to somehow wave my hands to create a platform from other pieces of RE tech he had previously picked out prior to hiring me.\n\nThe communication was inherently terrible from the beginning but became worse over time.  The broker would dictate messages only so the thoughts were incomplete word salad that I eventually trained an LLM to translate for me.  To give you an idea, he would send an email with the entire message in the subject line. 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nAbout two months in, he told me we should be hiring a minimum of 72 agents a year each.  With no real reasoning I got told that recruiting was always the focus (I have the receipts to prove that I was not hallucinating my original job title and focus).  Anytime I pushed back he would just yell that it was always the case and we must have not been paying attention.  He went so far as to ream me out during one of our last public meetings so badly I nearly quit on the spot.\n\nWhen asked what our selling points were he would say “it’s personal personal personal, luxury luxury luxury - same thing I’ve been saying over and over”.  The recruiters bringing on agents also become their “business strategist” and are meant to be their to coach, plan, provide technical help, etc (hence why he thinks “personal” is an effective recruiting strategy).\n\nHe is expecting a 1099 employee to recruit the agent, hire them on and THEN be paid $500/mo. for as long as they are with the company.  I believe the recruiter/strategist is also meant to get a small fee when they close but because the messaging is so chaotic it was never clear what that amount really was.  To be clear, you are meant to provide all the support to that agent aside from broker related questions and TC work.  I am not a recruiter - I was not hired to be.  But all the sudden I found myself forced to be one, and I had no idea how hard that would actually be.  \n\nDo you think anyone would sign on to be a full time recruiter + business strategist for $500/month per agent + small commission fee upon each closing?  He calls it ‘generous’ but I’m struggling to see it that way.  Am I crazy here?",

    "text": "Hi! I’m thinking of getting into new home sales. I have an interview at DR Horton next week. I wanted to know what their pay structure/commission is? A few other home builder websites had the pay structure and salary posted on the job listing, but DR Horton did not have a salary on there, just benefits. Do they even give a salary? Not really into it if they don’t. On top of that how is it working there? \n\nThanks!! ",

    "title": "Transaction manager role. Work structure and pay questions",
    "text": "So I recently had a screening with a recruiter for a transaction manager role supporting a singular realtor that can be summarized as being too busy to handle the backend processes. I have some stuff I was wondering if you’ve A) ever been in the role or B) hired someone for this role. \n\nThe structure is majority setting up the legal documents/contracts and coordinating new build stages with buyers. Some trickling in of market analysis and potentially house showings/open houses. \n\nOverall it feels like he just needs a second-in-command to help run his business which I get as I’ve been in project management for a few years now. \n\nMy questions are, is it normal to get a % bonus with each deal closed? (Not % of the transaction, but rather a % of my salary pay). If so what would I actually expect if they say they close around half a dozen homes a month? \n\nMy second question is, is it normal for me to have to do showings/open houses? I’m very familiar and comfortable with the operational and coordination side to it, however I’m not exactly an extroverted “realtor” type (I am easy to get along with and most of my coworkers always like to hang out with me after work FWIW) but I just feel slightly uncomfortable I might not be a good fit in that area, although he did say it was minimal, it’d still be there. \n\n\nAppreciate the insight.

    "text": "Currently working as an ISA under one of the best Commercial RE brokers in the business. I came into this job fully wanting to prepare myself to be an investor. I have about 6 years of sales experience and I am a 25M and former college athlete. \n\nThe thing about being an ISA under her team is that I am in charge of lead generation, cold calling, and underwriting new commercial listings. \n\nShe sat me down yesterday and told me that I would be a hell of a sales agent. I’ve only been doing this job for less than 2 months but she insist that she will pay for me to go to real estate school and I can still keep my base salary job until I finish. She said the skills I am learning are already what it takes to have a great career. My current girlfriend is a real estate agent as well, mostly residential and she has been killing it the past 2 years. \n\nMy only worry is that I don’t know if I will have enough money to go 100% into commission only. I worked so hard to pay my cc debt this year and I don’t know if I will have the funds to get me through the first few months of a commission only job. \n\nI trust my mentor as she is an investor herself with over $10M worth of real estate and does about 40 transactions a year. I know with her guidance I won’t fail. Next year is going to be a good year for Muti Family listings as many sellers will enter the market. \n\nI’ve thought about liquidating my 401K and Roth IRA to get me over the hump of the first 6-12 months. Part of me is terrified to start all over from nothing, but another part of me is like “Burn the boats and you’ll see what you’re made of.” \n\nA lot to think about but would love to hear what you guys think I should do. I can start real estate school now while getting a salary, stack my money in my savings, and at the end of Q1 2026, go into full time as an agent. \n\nThoughts? ",

    "text": "Hey everyone, I know this group gets A LOT of posts like this where people ask for advice about starting out in real estate but stay with me here. \n\nBackstory: I’m currently a full-time tv news producer but my contract is up in the middle of September (Sept. 11) \n\nI’ve been trying to figure out how to *smoothly* transition from one career to the next.\n\nI am planning to go full time into real estate and there are PLENTY of places around here looking for agents (I’m in Jacksonville, FL).\n\nNow my biggest concern is paying bills in this transition. My course is a week long and we go to take the test. \n\nAfterward I understand I need to actually speak with brokerages to see if I’m the right fit.\n\nI’m not trying to psyche myself out because I REALLY want this and I’m tired of corporate (like REALLY tired of corporate).\n\nThe biggest thing for me is the stability and I understand the industry isn’t always on solid ground.. But I’m cool because I’m building something to last. I was a server for 6 years at Red Lobster. If I can handle that, I promise I can handle anything lol. \n\nI’m just looking for advice truly because I don’t want to push this dream off because I’m scared of what may or may not happen. \n\nSo, would you suggest starting in the middle of the month or wait until the new month (because I would also at least be able to pay rent lol)\n\nOh yeah, I’m at about a 50k salary right now if that makes any difference.\n\nAny and all advice and comments are welcome from new and old agents please. I’d like a broad understanding. Thank you everyone! ",
