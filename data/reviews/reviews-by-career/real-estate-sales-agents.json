    "title": "Taught 7-8 years old kids and was hired as a realtor to buy $1.2M home",
    "text": "Last week, I asked in this sub how to teach real estate to my daughter's class who are 7-8 years old.\n\nMy daughter's teacher asked me to talk to their class regarding real estate. They are writing a paper and there's a real estate portion. They are 7/8 years old so I had to make sure I made it entertaining for them.\n\nThanks to your suggestions - I said that when buying a house, it's like a treasure hunt for the best home. I also told them that realtors are magicians because we can open any realtor lockbox in the area with our phone apps.\n\nDuring the discussion, they learned how to write a cheque and buy and sell houses in different provinces of Canada (currently, they're learning provinces and territories of Canada, they're learning to write in cursive, learn to write #s in words, learn about money which I integrated in writing a cheque). \n\nAt the end of the class, I gave each one of them a certificate that says they're Real Estate Superstar. I signed the certificate with my name on it. I was in their class for 1 hour.\n\nWhen my daughter went home, I received a book of the compilation of the kids' dream home. Most of their dream homes are castles, with pool, with tree house. It's their way of saying thank you to me. But that's not all, \n\nA parent contacted me. They're already pre-approved for financing to buy a home - the next day, we were looking at $1.2 - $1.4M homes and few days later, found the one and already has an accepted offer.\n\nAt this point, I don't see anything is gonna go wrong in our deal - clients are preapproved for much more $ (actually, they can pay cash if they want to so financing will never be an issue), house is built by a reputable builder in 2021 and the price - we got it as a deal - most listings in this area are $100k-$200k more - comparables were $50k-$100k above our accepted offer. My clients were willing to pay the asking price, I offered way less and after back and forth, our offer got accepted. \n\nEDIT: house is officially off market :) we got it! ",

Then they list with someone else. It happens every time. You’ll beg for referrals, knock doors, cold call, and still hear “no” more than “yes.”\n\nYou’re not selling houses.

If you don’t have money to outsource, guess what, you’re doing all of it yourself.\n\nAnd here’s what no one tells you: marketing costs destroy you. You’ll drop thousands on photos, staging, ads, open houses, and signs before you see a single dollar back. People love to flex their listings online, but half of them are broke behind the scenes.\n\nYou finally close a deal? Cool. Now wait a month or more to get paid. That one commission check has to last because you might not sell again for a while.\n\nForget weekends. Forget sleep. Buyers and sellers hit you up whenever they feel like it.

The top 10% eat while the rest fight for crumbs.\n\nAnd with AI now writing listings, handling paperwork, and even doing virtual showings, if all you do is open doors and send comps, you’re done. Tech doesn’t sleep, and it doesn’t need a commission.\n\nIf you’re chasing fast money, don’t even bother. This business will eat you alive.\n\nBut if you can take rejection every day, spend money before making any, and still get up hungry to grind again tomorrow. maybe you’ll survive.\n\nFor everyone else, keep watching Selling Sunset.

    "title": "I had an unrepresented Buyer ask for 9% in Closing Costs 😂 and threatened me 😬",
    "text": "I haven't really seen an uptick in Buyers reaching out directly on my listings, but when I do most of them have simple questions and almost all \"Just want to see the house\" and expect me to show it on their timeframe. I obtain permission from all my sellers ahead of time, in writing, to qualify an unrepresented Buyer before the seller allows the showing, especially if it's owner occupied. A seller isn't going to just leave to allow someone \"just looking\" to go through their home. \n\nSo I get a call, guy wants to see my 650k listing. Gives me his name, offers proof of funds ahead of time. Great! We set up a time to view the property, it's vacant. A couple days later he calls me before the showing. \n\n\"Hey I'm interested in the home but I feel it's overpriced based on my research.\" I tell him OK, what research and data do you have access to? It's been on market less than a week with 4 showings. Of course a home is only worth what someone is willing to pay, so tell me, in your opinion what is the value? He replies with\" Probably around $550,000 based on my research. \"\n\nAt this point I realize it's not necessarily worth my effort to continue to further educate him. I politely tell him, that unfortunately his opinion is wrong, based on my decade of experience and with local comps we're actually priced 2.5% under those comps. That I'm anticipating an offer from one of the 4 showings and he hasn't even seen the property yet to determine condition or if he likes it. \n\nHe replies \"I've seen enough online, I'd like to offer $550,000 and ask for 9% in Closing costs, with 3% of that being the Realtor Commission back to me\". \n\nAt this point I have a decision, I can discontinue the call and call my seller or have a bit of fun. So I have a bit of fun. \n\nOh thank you for the verbal offer, unfortunately seller, per our written contract will only review offers in writing. Additionally they will only review offers from people who have seen the property. Also it is illegal to pay a non licensed individual a commission and unless you are purchasing with an FHA/VA Loan you're capped at 6% In closing Costs generally. Also you sent me proof of funds and said you would be cash. \n\n\"Oh no, that's the statement from my father, we have the same name. I would be financing. You have to present my offer to the Seller.\"\n\nOk so you provided me proof of funds under false pretenses to see my Sellers home? Also you apparently have either received bad advice or no advice and it doesn't sound like you've spoken with a lender to understand your limits within financing. At this time I think it best to advise you to seek proper representation and without a valid approval we won't be showing you the property, per my seller instruction. \n\nIt's at this time he loses his mind 😂 \" You can't stop me from seeing it, I'll call your seller directly, you're just a greedy ba****** and I'll report you. \n\nI end the call by telling him I have no duty to him, maybe he should educate himself and based on his temper I would no longer feel comfortable meeting him. (I've been assaulted). Wished him the best and disconnected. \n\nDude called my broker and my broker told me he almost had to call the cops because the guy threatened to break into my sellers house. \n\nPeople are crazy. But it amazes me the extent some people believe they know better than us. ",

    "title": "When I pulled a listing on the day it was supposed to go live (and why it was the right call)",
    "text": "Just had the craziest experience I need to share in case it ever happens to you. Longtime lurker but this was too wild not to post.\n\nSo I got a call last week from this sweet elderly couple wanting to sell their home of 40+ years. Classic story - downsizing, moving closer to grandkids, etc. The house was a beautiful mid-century in an area that's absolutely blowing up right now.\n\nHere's where it gets weird. When I went for the initial walk-through, the husband (let's call him Frank) was super friendly but his wife (we'll say Martha) seemed really hesitant. Like, she'd agree to everything but I could tell something was off.\n\nFast forward to listing day. I'm there early to stage a few things and Martha pulls me aside looking totally stressed. Turns out, she didn't want to sell AT ALL. Frank had basically steamrolled her into it because their kids thought it was \"time.\" The poor woman was in tears talking about her garden and how all her memories were in that house.\n\nI made a call I've never made before - I pulled the listing THAT MORNING. Told Frank we needed to talk. The three of us sat down and I basically mediated their first real conversation about this move in months.\n\nTurns out, they could actually afford to keep the house AND get a small condo near the grandkids (they had way more equity than they realized). Frank just assumed selling was the only option because \"that's what old people do.\"\n\nLong story short - they're now my clients for buying a small vacation property instead, Martha gets to keep her garden, and I actually ended up with a more profitable commission structure in the end.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: Sometimes your job isn't just to sell houses, it's to make sure your clients are actually making the right decision. I could have pushed forward and made a quick commission on a hot property, but I'd have hated myself for it.\n\nAnyone else ever have to pump the brakes on a listing that was technically \"ready to go\" but just felt wrong?",

    "title": "Thinking of Becoming a Realtor? Here's the Ugly Truth (From Someone in the Trenches)",
    "text": "Let me save you some time and heartache. If you’re thinking of becoming a Realtor because you saw someone on Instagram driving a G-Wagon and holding a “Just Sold” sign, pump the brakes. I’ve been in this business for a few years now and I’m here to give you the unfiltered, no-BS version of what this career is really like.\n\n1. 80% of new agents are gone within 2 years.\nWhy? Because this isn’t a job—it’s a business. There’s no salary, no sick days, no health insurance. It’s commission-only, which means if you don’t close, you don’t eat. Most people don’t have the discipline, savings, or stomach for that.\n\n2. Nobody trusts you in the beginning.\nYour friends and family will say they support you—until they list with someone else. It hurts, and it happens more than you think. You have to prove yourself before anyone gives you a shot, which means cold calling, door knocking, begging for referrals, and hearing “no” more times than you can count.\n\n3. You're not selling homes—you're running a full-blown business.\nYou’re the marketer, the social media manager, the customer service rep, the negotiator, the transaction coordinator, the accountant, and more. If you don’t have the money to outsource those tasks, guess what? You’re doing all of them. And most of your day will be spent doing everything except showing homes.\n\n4. It takes months (sometimes years) to make consistent money.\nLet’s say you do get a listing. Congrats. You’ll work your ass off staging it, marketing it, holding open houses, then it sells… and you get paid maybe 45 days later. That one check? It needs to last, because you might not close another deal for a while.\n\n5. Your time is never your own.\nForget weekends. Forget holidays. Forget relaxing nights. Buyers and sellers want your attention on their schedule. And if you’re not responsive? They’ll move on to the next agent who is. Real estate doesn’t care about your work-life balance.\n\n6. The emotional rollercoaster is savage.\nYou’ll spend months nurturing a client who ghosts you at the last second. You’ll get into escrow only to have it fall apart days before closing. You’ll have to be a therapist, a firefighter, and a miracle worker—daily.\n\n7. The market is oversaturated.\nEveryone and their cousin is a Realtor now. There are 1.5+ million agents in the U.S., and only a small percentage of them are doing meaningful volume. It’s a noisy, hyper-competitive space where people will undercut you just to get a listing.\n\n8. And here’s the kicker: AI is coming for all the weak agents.\nIf you think this job is about opening doors and filling out contracts, you’re already replaceable. AI is getting better by the day—automating paperwork, analyzing property data, writing listing descriptions, and even doing showings virtually. In a few years, the agents who bring no unique value, no deep market knowledge, and no people skills will be gone. Tech doesn’t need sleep, it doesn’t take a commission, and it doesn’t forget to follow up.\n\nSo if you’re thinking of jumping into this thinking it’s quick money, easy sales, or a “fun” job—don’t. This business is a meat grinder, and most of you won’t make it.\n\nBut if you’re obsessed with real estate, resilient as hell, and willing to sacrifice time, money, and comfort to build something real? Then maybe—just maybe—you’ve got a shot.\n\nFor everyone else, stick to watching Selling Sunset. It’s safer.\n\n—A tired Realtor who’s still in the game (for now)",

Sometimes the $10M clients are easier than the $500k ones. They're usually crazy busy and just want you to handle everything. No 2am texts about cabinet hardware. No Sunday morning panic calls about anythinggg.\n\nBut here's the trap: Don't get comfortable just because they're wealthy. Had a $4M deal fall apart last week because another agent gave them a \"better story\" about a different property.

I just wanted to share a personal story of a listing I had this year that just wasn’t moving.\n\nIt was priced right, staged, had good photos, went on the MLS, and got shared on Instagram.

But instead of just filming my own video like always, I invited other agents to create theirs too, for FREE.\n\nEach broker got a chance to appear on camera, use one of a few short scripts I prepared, and walk away with a professional video they could post on their own social media.\n\nThey got new content, and my listing got ten extra videos shared across different audiences. No paid ads, no begging for views.\n\nMost of them had never made a real estate video before, so it turned into a fun, collaborative thing 😄. And the property FINALLY got attention and managed to get a few showings in the same week.\n\nIf you have a listing that has gone quiet, this might be worth trying, because it worked for my listing!\n\nLet me know if you ever tried this or if you would give it a shot.",

This is a very nice building in a world-famous location, not the nicest building in the zip code, but enviable for sure. Units range from $600k-$2mm. \n\nI met these buyers two years ago when they came to one of my listings in the building. We got to know each other, and then they made a joke of an offer which my seller and I couldn’t take seriously. Nothing came of that. \n\n——fast forwarding here—— \n\nLast month, a unit in the building that was under contract had their deal fall apart. They dropped the price to a shockingly low number to move it quickly. \n\nWe went to go look at it, and they demanded to make an offer on it that any reasonable person would be insulted by. 20% below list when the property is already listed at a very low number. Of course the listing agent called and chewed me out, angry he had to present it, sellers were pissed, blah blah blah. \n\nEventually, I got my buyers up to a number that I deemed acceptable to present, still too low, but only because I was willing to cut my commission request to the seller, which made the offer seem sort of acceptable. \n\nAfter a week of fine tuning the terms, the sellers accepted our deal and I woke up to an acceptance today. \n\nWe went into the unit today, and my buyers couldn’t stop saying awful, terrible things about the sellers. For no reason. I was so fucking livid that these people were so ungrateful, not to mention the stress I’ve gone through this past week. They were able to take advantage of the sellers situation to buy the property below market value, and the husband did nothing but complain when they are beyond lucky to get it for this price. \n\nI wanted to throw him off the balcony.

    "title": "2 year client wants 40% of my commission",
    "text": "I am dealing with an incredibly annoying/dense client who is under contract, two weeks from closing my biggest deal. I have been working with this client for 2 years. He chose to work with me because I’m in his community and he heard good things about me (his words). \n\nWhen we started working together he kept reiterating that he was very relaxed who was fairly on top of the market and would only require showings if he couldn’t get to an open house. I was glad to hear it especially because his search is over an hour away from where I live but thought it was unnecessary as I was happy to show him homes as quickly as they were available to view.  \n\nEvery aspect of getting him to offer something reasonable was like pulling teeth, he argued with me about every little thing. I kept calm and explained to him that his offers were weak and he most likely wouldn’t be considered. He did not believe me but after the 14th failed offer he started to wonder if it was because we were POC, my brokerage, my age and gender. I put my foot down and I told him I would be more aggressive on my opinion since he was starting to blame me and my calm attitude was not getting through to him. Some people need to be yelled at or experience an alpha I guess… \n\n2 years in, 16 offers, over 50 showings with him and his poorly behaved children who I watched over like a babysitter because he and his wife couldn’t be bothered to keep an eye on them. The hours on hours I spent driving for these showings and with this client on the phone to give him my professional advice and opinion on price strategies, best terms to offer and explaining what highest and best meant over and over again was all finally is worth something because we are under contract. \n\nHe has switched loan officers 4 times to get the best offer. Completely wasted my preferred lender’s time for 7 months, luckily the lender knows his reputation for being a professional time waster. Harassed his lawyer and me nonstop during A/I in the late evenings and weekends for answers that we were simply waiting for response on. This guy lacks boundaries or awareness of how this all works but refuses to comprehend when taught. \n\nHe has a request for me now that we are finally out of A/I. He wants 40% of my commission. I audibly laughed on the phone when he asked. It was a reflex but I was shocked. He then went down to 13.5%. I told him I would give him a flat payment (I would typically give this to a client as a GIFT for way less due to the amount of time and effort I have put in) of .5% of my commission. He argued with me over this for quite some time and I’m disgusted. It’s insulting and I have never “given” my clients money back this way. He feels it’s fair to ask since he wasn’t “that much work” and he claims that his previous realtor gave him a similar amount. I wonder why he isn’t working with that guy if he gave him close to half of his commission. \n\nHe said he was giving me a chance as a new young realtor. I’ve been doing this for 4 years and this is one of 4 closings I have scheduled for the month of November. \n\nI’m inclined to offer .5% one last time and let him know it’s only as a courtesy. Take it or leave it but we aren’t arguing or talking about this again. \n\nI recognize that this is an important lesson for me and I have this client for a reason. It’s to make me a stronger realtor. I’m curious if any of you have had to navigate a situation like this and what you did.\n\nFor numbers, this is about $20k commission, after split and tax I’m looking at $13k take home ",

I’ve had zero income during this time and was finally about to close my first deal — or so I thought.\n\nI had two clients interested in the same rental, but because of multiple representation rules, my boss told me I had to hand one off to another agent in the office. I agreed, trying to be professional and follow the rules, and gave the second client to a colleague.\n\nThis client had already seen over 10 homes with me. I built the relationship. I scheduled every showing. I did all the driving. I handled the documents. I kept the deal alive. I gave this client to her on a silver platter.\n\nMy boss told me to make sure I asked for a 50/50 split. I forgot to mention it. That’s on me. But I truly didn’t expect another agent, who closes multiple deals a month, to just take the full commission without saying a word.

    "text": "I listed a home 6 days ago and we've already had 10 showings, good traffic! The main feedback has been that buyers don’t like that it’s in an HOA or that the main road is too close. (Which makes me think... if you hate HOAs, why are you even scheduling a showing on a house in one? But I digress.)\n\nWe just got an offer, yay, right? Well… not so fast.\n\nMy seller doesn’t like the offer because the buyer is asking for closing cost assistance. I showed him the numbers and explained that, in our area, it’s very much a buyer’s market right now, and it’s common for buyers to request help with closing costs. But he refuses to consider it, he’s holding out for a full-price offer with zero concessions.\n\nI’ve tried to explain the reality of the market, shared comps, and talked through the pros/cons, but he’s just not having it. I want to advocate for my client, but I also need to keep things realistic.\n\nHow do you handle sellers who have unrealistic expectations and won't budge, even when the market clearly says otherwise?\n\nWould love to hear how others navigate this.\n\nUPDATE: I spoke with the seller last night and today.  I figured out something huge, he is very emotionally attached to the home. After listening to him for over half hour without really interrupting, it was almost like he was ready to let it go. This morning his attitude was completely different and we agreed on countering at full price with 2% towards buyers closing costs and we are officially under contract 😊  I'll keep you guys posted 📫 Thank you for all the help, advice and suggestions.

I had ran comps and presented them at the listing appointment a long with my marketing strategies, how I can sell it, and price point… \n\nWell, they wanted me to list it over the comps I ran. I did tell them that at that price point, this home will sit longer on the market, but I can market it and I will make sure to work my butt off. I did tell them that if we don’t see much action, that we can discuss future plans. They then told me no open houses, no social media posts, and no flyers… \n\nSo, I posted the link for the home, obviously put my sign up and I spoke to my brokerage about other ways to market… and we weren’t really sure how else to market. I did bring it up to my clients and they said they felt it was unnecessary. \n\nFast forward… they moved to a different state (site unseen) and they are now needing the funds from this listing to redo the entire home due to rat infestation… they asked me to come up with a list of how I plan to sell the home within a month… I ran comps again… (home values depreciated in the area so it was lower now) and I brought the list of marketing ideas that I had brought up previously and potentially doing some video footage (100% I would pay for it). I told them that the value of the home isn’t at the price they are expecting and I gave them a rundown of the comparable homes and what the median price would be. \n\nWell, they called me a few hours after I presented it and said “how do we get out of the contract? You aren’t what we are looking for and you are more reactive than proactive.” I did ask what their expectations were and why they felt I was reactive. They stated because I wanted to lower the price of the home. They also stated that they felt they were constantly reaching out to me (I did check my texts and it was never like that at all), they stated that I wasn’t going to be able to sell the home due to me not doing it full-time (I have one other listing and work a full-time job that is very understanding), and they stated that they spoke to multiple other agents and dropping the home price would look tacky and cheap… they were 70k over market value. \n\nI am sure I could have made more of an effort to communicate more often, but I was communicating more than 3 times a week, I constantly check on the home to make sure everything is good, and I was very diligent in giving them my comps. I ran state comps, county comps, and comps within .5 of a mile and a full mile… \n\nWhat else could I have done? ",

    "title": "The Realities of a Realtor Career: Are You Ready?",
    "text": "\n\n\nThis career isn’t what it used to be — and the “easy money” you’ve heard about? It’s a lot harder to come by than you think.\n\nI’ve been in the industry for about 4 years now. Back in real estate school, our teacher said something that stuck with me:\n\"Don’t quit your day job thinking you’ll start making money right away.\"\nI listened. And I’m glad I did.\n\nHere’s the truth: many people won’t make it in this business. If you could shadow a full-time realtor for even a week, most of you would probably walk away before ever getting your license.\n\nWhat You Don’t See Behind the Scenes:\nClients ghosting you after weeks (or months) of communication\n\nDeals falling apart at the last minute\n\nCommissions are getting squeezed from all sides\n\nPeople wasting your time with no intention to buy or sell\n\nEndless rejection, inconsistent income, and lots of unpaid work\n\nIf a deal goes smoothly, chances are you got lucky. Most aren’t.\n\nThe “Experts” Will Line Up to Sell You Success\nThe moment you show interest in this career, you’ll be flooded by:\n\nCoaches\n\nMarketers\n\nSocial media “gurus”\n\nAuthors and course creators\n\nAll promising “the formula” for success — for a fee, of course. Each one telling you to do this and avoid that. You’ll be pulled in 10 directions, and before long, you’ll be second-guessing everything.\n\nWhat You’re Going to Hear:\n“You need to be a marketing expert.” This should start before you even sign up for classes.\n\n“You need to cold call 50-200 people a day and have 25+ real estate conversations daily.” And by the way — cold calling can get you in legal trouble. One agent was recently sued for calling someone on the Do Not Call list. Your E&amp;O insurance won’t save you.\n\n“You need to constantly network.” That means going to church events, Chamber of Commerce mixers, local meetups — all while staying top of mind. This is a full-time job by itself.\n\n“You need a strong social media presence.” That means driving all over town filming live videos, property tours, branding content, and staying consistent online.\n\nYou’ll Learn About Farming, Too:\n“Farming” means picking a neighborhood and working it consistently.\n\nHosting community events (taco trucks, ice cream socials, etc.)\n\nMailing postcards, newsletters, etc.\n\nBuilding trust over years, not weeks\n\nNow Let’s Talk Money 💸\nThis isn’t a cheap business to start. Here’s a taste of what you’ll need (and this is conservative):\n\nPre-licensing courses &amp; test retakes: $200–$500\n\nMLS fees, lockboxes, signage, materials: $3,000+\n\nOpen house supplies, branded marketing: $500–$1,000\n\nCRM systems and ads: Easily $1,000–$3,000/month\n\nBusiness license / LLC setup: $1,000–$3,000\n\nAccountant &amp; taxes: 30% of every commission should go to Uncle Sam\n\nDriving / gas / car wear: $$$ adds up fast\n\nRealistically, you should have 24 months of monthly expenses plus the fees I've shared saved before jumping in — especially if you're going solo.\n\nJoining a Brokerage or Team? Be careful.\nAsk why you're paying fees if you are the one generating the business.\n\nMany teams promise leads — few deliver.\n\nIf there's high turnover, run. That usually means the leads are weak and the team is disorganized.\n\nIf you're giving away a chunk of your commission, make sure you’re actually getting something in return (structure, training, systems, support).\n\nExpect to Go 6 Months, a Year, Maybe Two Without a Paycheck.\nThe first deal is always the hardest. Many new agents won’t make it that far. The bills keep coming. Reality sets in. And people give up.\n\nAlso — most successful agents I know have another source of income or a supportive partner, especially in the beginning.\n\nOne More Thing — Safety.\nThis is a seriously overlooked part of real estate.\nYou’re meeting strangers in vacant homes. You could deal with squatters. Or worse.\nAsk any brokerage what safety training they offer. If they don’t have an answer — that’s a red flag.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\nThis business is not for the faint of heart. It’s high-risk, high-grind, and often low-reward in the beginning.\n\nBut if you're prepared, persistent, and treat it like the real business it is — with a plan, savings, and the right expectations — you might just make it.\n\nBut if you’re thinking this is a quick and easy money game?\nYou’re going to learn the hard way.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "I’m not sure what flair to use for a vent post, but this is the kind of shit that makes me want to leave this industry. I can bust my ass off and have nothing to show for it at the end of the day besides what-ifs.\n\nThe most frustrating one was today, on one of my listings that I could’ve done dual agency one. I live in a very low cost of living area, which means home prices are very low. I’ve had this property listed for 2 months at $65,000. Which is a fair price, if the house was in good condition. The biggest issues with this house are moisture in the basement (common in my area), and needing a new roof. I was hoping we would get an offer that involved closing cost assistance for those items, or having the repairs done prior to closing. But that hasn’t happened in the 2 months that it’s been listed. My seller lives out of state, and I assumed he would be very motivated to sell it.\n\nWell I finally found a buyer that was perfect for it. He needed a one floor home (very rare in this area and especially price range) and him and his son are contractors, so the work doesn’t scare them off. I got them pre-approved and submitted an offer at full price with 6% sellers assist. I called my seller, told him we had a full priced offer and told him what his net earnings would be. He was really excited and told me he would sign it as soon as I sent it to him. \n\nWell my seller flipped his shit about paying $3,900 in seller’s assist. Even though I told him his earnings over the phone, I guess seeing it on paper freaked him out. I did my absolute best to prepare him and tell him that after 2 months, we aren’t going to receive a full price offer anyway. Instead he insisted on the buyer raising their offer to account for it, and the buyer got cold feet and is no longer interested. There goes $5,000 in commissions because my seller is being stubborn and not understanding the market.\n\nThen I had buyers approved for $300,000, looking in a city about an hour away from me. After a couple weeks of showings, we found a house that they loved for $250,000. It had been on the market for 5 days, although showings weren’t allowed until the day that we saw it. We put our full priced offer in that night and set it to expire the next day. The next day the listing agent reaches out and says his seller is flying home that day, and asks if they can respond by noon the next morning instead of today. He also says that they have 1 other offer and will likely call for highest and best after they review them.\n\nI say of course that’s fine, we can wait until noon the next morning. I relay that info to my buyers and tell them that we will hear back by noon… well that was Monday. It’s now Thursday, and the listing agent never got back to me and is ignoring my texts and calls. Now I look like an idiot to my buyers, and they said they will be using another buyer’s agent. There goes anywhere from $7,000-$9,000 in commissions. So in a span of 4 days, I go from possibly making $12,000-$14,000 in June to $0. For reference, in a low cost of living area my mortgage payment is only $700. I normally average 2 deals a month, but I only make about $2,500 per deal. This would’ve been huge for me and the best month of my 3 year career\n\nEdit- I actually lost 4 deals as one terminated literally 2 minutes ago. One of my listings, the perspective buyers are calling off their engagement and no longer buying the house together. What the fuck ",

    "title": "My Story: Introvert Takes on Real Estate",
    "text": "When I first started off, I spent way too much time watching YouTube videos of successful realtors and entrepreneurs. I thought I was getting motivated but really I was just consuming content without taking any real action. I was \"busy\" but not productive, and I was focusing on the wrong things like creating the perfect logo and brand image instead of doing what really mattered, which was talking to people!\n\nI now feel that the key to growing your business is simple and straight forward. It's not about how polished your brand looks. It's about getting out there, making real connections and providing genuine value, whether that's face to face or over the phone. These are the real activities that actually help generate business, pay your bills and set you up for future success.\n\nI remember in the beginning I spent hours designing some door hangers and had all this excitement &amp; motivation to get out there and hand them out to generate business. When I finally got the shipment delivered, that motivation turned into fear immediately when reality hit me that now I had to physically put myself out there and actually hand them out and have conversations with people. I remember pulling up to a neighbourhood and sitting in my car absolutely terrified and the longer I sat in my car the more negativity my brain started feeding itself. I started questioning myself and my negative thoughts literally took control of my life in that moment. All I was thinking about was \"what are people going to say when they open the door, I'm brand new and I don't know anything, how am I going to deal with rejection, how do I carry a conversation forward, I'm going to make a fool out of myself doing this\". It got SOO bad that when I would drive to a neighbourhood to door knock, I would literally just sit in my car for an hour trying to get ready and when I finally felt ready I would just go put the door hangers on the door knob and move to the next house to avoid conversation. When I saw people standing outside, I would purposely skip that house and move on to the next one where I knew I didn't have to talk to anyone. This happened for days and honestly I was about to give up and say this career isn't for me. I remember one night I went home, watched more YouTube videos for motivation and tips from other successful realtors but this time reality just hit me hard. I realized I can't keep doing this anymore and there is absolutely no way I'll be able to make a name for myself repeating this same pattern day in and day out, let alone pay my bills. \n\nMe being spiritual, I read a quote which I now consider the most important quote in my life and that is \"Faith &amp; Fear Cannot Co-Exist\". So the next time I went door knocking I just put all my faith into god and told myself \"whatever happens is going to happen for the best and I'm not going to stress about this anymore\". I remember being terrified when I walked up to the first house and rang the doorbell. That suspense of waiting for someone to open the door and me having to initiate the conversation was crazy, I'll never forget it lol, I'm surprised I didn't just faint on the spot but to my surprise, the conversation went well and house after house I got more comfortable and it got to a point where I was excited to ring the door bell and see what kind of interaction I would be having. To save you some time and extra details, when I went home that night (which I considered my real first day of proper door knocking), I had someone call my phone asking about listing their home and this family ended being my first ever seller clients! I took this as god &amp; the universe rewarding me for stepping out of my comfort zone, doing what I knew I needed to do regardless of all the anxiety and stress I was feeling, and simply just allowing me to realize that It isn't soo bad after all. I am yet to meet someone that got a client which they were able to close from their very first day ever door knocking. The universe works in amazing ways I can't even begin to describe.\n\nSo if you're just starting out, don't over complicate things and just remember this one thing, stop waiting for everything to be \"perfect\" and simply just start. Conversations lead to opportunities and once you prioritize that day after day while improving your skills, the compounding effect will make everything else fall into place!\n\nSee you all at the table of success 🫡",

Sometimes I feel like I “got lucky” but remember just how much hard work and sacrifice I put in everyday. I’ve been in the business 4 years and have done around 130-140 transactions as a solo agent, full time college student, husband and father. (25M)\n\nI hear so many stories of people getting into the business and not being successful and honestly just want to hear stories of people who got into young and HAVE became successful. I’m wondering if there are any specific common traits or backgrounds that we all share.",

    "text": "Hi everyone!  I’m a real estate agent in Brazil and our market works *very* differently compared to the US. I’d love to share a few facts that usually surprise international agents, and I’m curious about your reactions.\n\nHere are some realities of how things often work here:\n\n* Exclusive listings are rare — the same property is usually listed with multiple agents.\n* There’s no true MLS system, so agents spend a lot of time “hunting” for listings and confirming availability directly.\n* **There’s no concept of a “buyer’s agent.”** Agents mainly represent the seller, and buyers often just reach out to whoever has the listing. Because of this, the competition to *capture and mantain listings* is extremely fierce.\n* Clients often contact several agents at once for the same property.\n* 🚨 **For new condo developments:** agents do “sales shifts” at the developer’s stand. Shifts are 8 hours long, no salary, only commission (\\~1.5%).\n* At these stands, there can be 30+ agents from different brokerages working together. Potential buyers who walk in are assigned by a *daily lottery system*. If you’re unlucky and get the last spot in the draw, you might spend the whole day without speaking to a single client.\n\nI’m gathering reactions to these differences to create content for my Instagram, showing how real estate practices vary around the world.\n\n👉 If you reply, please note that I may share your comment (translated) on Instagram. If you’d like to be credited, include your u/handle so I can tag you.\n\nHow would you feel working in a market like this? What do you think would be the hardest part?",

    "text": "I'm in Texas, been licensed 24+ years. We have what's called the Intermediary, not Dual Agency. I've represented both buyers and sellers in the Intermediary many times in my career. Because I educate my clients before we go out and do anything, it's always been an easy situation to be in... I just closed my first where it was an unrepresented Buyer, and it was interesting to say the least...\n\nThe buyer contacted me via Facebook, so all red flags appeared about it being a scam. He wanted to make an offer before viewing the property. I presented his \"verbal\" to the sellers, who laughed and said no. A couple of weeks later, the guy came back about $30k higher, which is about 10% in this area, again verbal. I asked for proof of funds and driver's license. He sent me images of 3 different bank accounts and the license. The sellers said they would entertain, but wanted the buyer/investor to view the house before hashing out a contract, the buyer refused.\n\nHe ghosted, so more \"scam\" vibes. I mean, if you want a house for a deal, you make it a point to view it, right? Anyway, he finally decided he would view it before a contract. However, I wasn't going to dare waste my time showing this mystery scam guy the house, as I could wind up dead in a ditch and I have kids to think about... but I was willing to spend $50 to have an agent open a door for him, so that's what I did. \n\nAfter the showing, the agent said he seemed sketchy and rude. He texts me saying he wants the house and to \"write it up\"... I spoke with my sellers about how they wanted the offer written since they're the ones I represent. I wrote that offer up with every term in my Sellers's favor. I bullet-pointed the terms in an email with the offer for the buyer to sign. He's bought other houses before, so I didn't feel bad not explaining anything. He signed it. \n\nAs a savvy investor, not sure why he didn't argue about Buyer paying the Title Policy and Waiving the HOA docs and financials, and no inspection period or home warranty... LOL\n\nThe entire 13 days, I kept preparing my Sellers for everything to fall apart and not get their hopes up too much as it all seemed very sketch. Even the title company called me concerned about Buyer behavior. Some bumps in the road, like he didn't submit earnest on time, and he wouldn't schedule the closing timely, but we closed Cash in 13 days... It was a crazy ride!",

My friends are still great and super supportive. But now, I’m a broker myself. I’ve opened my own brokerage with a colleague, which is something I never would’ve imagined happening so soon.\n\nI’ve always been someone who stays at jobs for the long haul, so all of this change has been a lot.

When I came back, right away the team approached me to come back, and have done so multiple times at this point. They offered to give me buyers, but the split was 50/50, and then I’d split my 50% with Keller Williams, which would take another 36% of my cut initially. I said no.\n\nNow, they approached me again and are pleading with me to come back, because they’re moving from Philly to Florida in June and want to split all of their clients between me and another agent on the team. The terms are better now, with it being 50/50 for their leads and 70/30 for me own clients I bring in. They’re switching brokerages so now I’ll only have to pay $500 per transaction from my cut as far as I understand.\n\nI did the math, and they did 60 deals and $550-600k in commission the last year. If business doesn’t slow down, my cut would be around $100-125k (not counting anyone I bring in).\n\nAm I stupid for turning this down? I am 26 years old and I’m flattered that they’re turning down the other candidates and trying to get me, but I know for a fact that I don’t want to be a full-time realtor until I retire. I absolutely hate the on-call lifestyle. Had to spend Easter Sunday doing last minute showings, and they decided not to buy, which was not great lol. I’m good with people and have always been good at the job, but I want to pursue another career, which would definitely take an initial pay cut (the starting salary would be $50,000). My biggest concern is that I take the deal for the money and then lose the years of building up another career.\n\nDo you think it would be better to take the money for now and see how it goes or turn them down?

I have benefits, pension, good salary. I have a mortgage, a wife, a 3 year old and another one the way. My wife makes 80k as a physio therapist, and we have about a year's worth of expenses in cash.\n\nIt seems obvious I have to quit RE, but I just love the business so much.\n\nAdvise PLEASE. Thanks so much.",

    "text": "I’m a year in, only closed once. I have written many offers that just didn’t make the cut whether I did or didn’t know it would. I’m stressed, wanted to save 6 months salary of my current job and quit to focus full time in real estate (which would only be $10-12,000). I’m tired, down, and close to tears. But I absolutely do not want to stop. I actually like being an agent, it feels like a game to me. I haven’t really felt like this with any job or field. I’ve seen agents who joined the team after me, working or not, already pumping out more closed deals like nothing. \nI’m worried my team would be tired of me not closing anything and toss me out. But until then I will commit to stick it out and make a career and future for myself. If newer agents are doing better than me. I need to get stricter with myself. I know I can do better, I blame my day job due to how much it drains me mentally and takes up prime time I could be doing anything else real estate. Any day I’m not working there, I am doing showings and following up with people. \nI am working on cold calling people more and trying to be more consistent. I just wish I am in the position to quit this job so I can breathe and live real estate. But I need to commit more. I really see a lot of people fizzle out because they gave up too easily. I refuse to give in, nothing great comes easy. I don’t need to be great, just great enough!\nIs there anyone that has been in a similar position as me? Curious to how you navigated these obstacles and made something of yourself.",

    "title": "Is it the brokerage or the Agent?",
    "text": "I got my license right out of high school and have been at the same brokerage since. It split from KW around that time and became independent. I started on a 50/50 split for my first 10 deals, then moved off that after my first year.\n\nBack then, training was great—one of the owners was a killer salesperson and led most of it. But after a falling out, he was bought out about 3 years ago, and training quality tanked. We absorbed another brokerage, but the brokers we got in return don’t do any personal business and basically coast on salary. One of them is also our “productivity coach,” but honestly, he's terrible.\n\nThe current owner is solid—closes 50–80 deals a year and makes time for us—but his style isn’t replicable, so the training isn’t that useful. Recently, one of our top producers tried to help by running office-wide training since morale was low. But when they tried to figure out how to pay him, the brokerage lowballed him to keep paying the existing coach. They ended up copying his methods anyway, but the quality dropped.\n\nThe comp structure also changed:\n\n* **Old (Partner Plan)**: 70/30 split, $24K cap, Realtorcom leads, paid sign installs, E&amp;O, listing photos, RedX, CoStar (just me, since I cold call), TC, and training (though it was already getting weak).\n* **Now**: 80/20 split, $25K cap, no leads, no sign installs, no listing photos. Still includes E&amp;O, TC, RedX, CoStar, training (still bad), plus free printing and paper for flyers/mailers.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know I’m the one who has to make the calls, but the energy in the office sucks. I’m 22 and usually in the top 10 agents, only doing around $6M a year, but most people do their own thing. That gets tiring, especially when you're the only one door knocking or cold calling. I also feel like I shouldn't be top 10 in the brokerage with the volume Im doing I feel like we don't have enough high producers and the ones that are high producers our opinions arent valued when we share them and I feel like if there was more comradery and more top producers the brokerage wouldn't be changing up the training all the time cause we would know what works. VS rn the brokerage we absorbed was failing and now it feels like we're getting bullshit training.\n\nThis was the only brokerage I interviewed with, and at the time it felt like the right fit. But with everything that’s changed, I’m not so sure anymore. I guess I just needed to vent—but I’m also wondering if I’m being realistic or falling into “grass is greener” thinking.\n\n  \nAlso the shitty part about leaving is I have a CRM full of around 1k leads that I generated myself through door knkcing and cold calling. I have a few listings and buyers with signed contracts and all of those would stay with the brokerage. So yeah...\n\n  \nWhat would you do if you were me? I'm in UT if that helps. ",

    "text": "I answered an ad on LinkedIn for a job of a real estate coach, the next day they invited me to do an interview, I realized it was no actual salary for the job instead, I had to pay a joining fee of $145 plus $85 monthly fee once I was part of their team . Although nowhere on the job listing didn’t mention that you had to be a real estate broker with a real estate broker license they told me I had to get the license in order to do the job. I instantly paid $300 and started spending hours of time on the course and also joined two of their team calls. \nTony Hughes interviewed me and mentor me and kept encouraging me to do the course before they could give me any coaching clients a week later after I’ve spent quite a bit of time on the course I got an email from Tony saying they no longer needed me. This is after he knew for well I had paid for the course or need to do this job.\n\nI’ve tried repeatedly to get the money back for the course, I told them I wouldn’t have done the course unless I was doing the coaching job, I have no interest in being a real estate broker and selling houses, they simply ignore me and will not return my money. This company treated me very badly. My soul cold mentor, Tony Hughes, does not answer any emails and just completely ignores me having push me into doing the real estate course. Even though I’ve threatened to post what has happened on social media they still don’t care.\nBuyer beware of LGI Realty. ",

    "text": "So I recently had a screening with a recruiter for a transaction manager role supporting a singular realtor that can be summarized as being too busy to handle the backend processes. I have some stuff I was wondering if you’ve A) ever been in the role or B) hired someone for this role. \n\nThe structure is majority setting up the legal documents/contracts and coordinating new build stages with buyers. Some trickling in of market analysis and potentially house showings/open houses. \n\nOverall it feels like he just needs a second-in-command to help run his business which I get as I’ve been in project management for a few years now. \n\nMy questions are, is it normal to get a % bonus with each deal closed? (Not % of the transaction, but rather a % of my salary pay). If so what would I actually expect if they say they close around half a dozen homes a month? \n\nMy second question is, is it normal for me to have to do showings/open houses? I’m very familiar and comfortable with the operational and coordination side to it, however I’m not exactly an extroverted “realtor” type (I am easy to get along with and most of my coworkers always like to hang out with me after work FWIW) but I just feel slightly uncomfortable I might not be a good fit in that area, although he did say it was minimal, it’d still be there. \n\n\nAppreciate the insight.

    "title": "A Few Things That Helped a Realtor I Work With Get More Leads",
    "text": "I’ve been working with a real estate client for a little while, and we made a few small changes that ended up making a huge difference in their business. Figured I’d share in case it helps anyone else.\n\n1. Making It Easy for Clients to Leave Reviews\n\nThis one was simple. They were closing deals, people were happy, but almost no one was leaving Google reviews. We set up a system to remind clients to leave a review at the right time, and the number of 5-star ratings basically doubled in a couple of months.\n\nWhat changed? Now, when someone searches for an agent in their area, they show up with the highest rating and the most reviews. No ads, no crazy marketing budget—just making it easy for past clients to vouch for them.\n\n2. Fixing the Website So It Actually Gets Leads\n\nA lot of realtor websites look nice but don’t really do much. Their old site had plenty of info, but there was no clear next step. We made a few tweaks:\n\t•\tAdded a “Book a Call” button on every page\n\t•\tCreated neighborhood-specific pages that attract buyers searching in those areas\n\t•\tSet up a simple form to collect leads instead of just showing listings\n\nNow, instead of people browsing and leaving, they actually reach out.\n\n3. Showing Up in Google for the Right Searches\n\nInstead of trying to compete with Zillow and Redfin for the big “homes for sale” searches, we focused on the searches where people actually need a realtor:\n\t•\t“Best realtor for first-time buyers in [city]”\n\t•\t“How to sell a house fast in [city]”\n\t•\t“Closing costs for sellers in [city]”\n\nIt took some time, but now their site is getting leads without paying for ads.\n\nNone of this was a crazy overhaul, just a few small things that added up. Anyone else tried similar things? What’s been working for you?",
