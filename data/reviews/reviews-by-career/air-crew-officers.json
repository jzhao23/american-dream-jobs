    "text": "I’m so sorry. \n\nI didn’t know that it was okay to share sensitive information over commercial unclassified applications. I should have had more faith in the end-to-end encryption software that there’s *no* way an outside party could view it…unless you accidentally add them. \n\nTo the OS I busted down and stripped of a security clearance for sending an email to his buddies on Gmail saying “make sure you’re watching CNN at 3:30”, which just so happened to be the ToT of our Tomahawk strike, please forgive me. I wasn’t aware that this type of information doesn’t count as classified. \n\nTo the Sailors who brought their iPhones into our SCIF and took pictures of Secret binders to “study for a test”, and whom I stripped of clearances and re-rated, my apologies. Your phones are obviously impenetrable fortresses that are perfectly safe for storing and transmitting classified data. Fort Knox with retina scanners, or something. \n\nTo the Lieutenant whose career I destroyed for trying (and failing) to cover up a major crypto breach that occurred due to your almost criminal incompetence, my bad. This probably didn’t compromise several of our sensitive systems. \n\nTo the three people I administratively separated for taking classified information home, what an overreaction! I mean it’s *home*! Home is where you’re safe!\n\nTo the person who will remain nameless currently sitting in the brig for divulging Top Secret information that jeopardized the life of a key intelligence source, boy am I sorry I helped put you away! These sources know what they’re getting themselves into. They should, at a minimum , expect that senior officials will repeatedly share their names and locations over unclassified networks. Sorry, not sorry. \n\nI can’t believe I spent over 30 years needlessly harassing and henpecking innocent people just trying to do their jobs for these and other security “violations”. Man, do I have egg on my face!\n\nI’m grateful that honorable men such as Secretary Hegseth and Director of National Intelligence Gabbard have shown me the way information like this should have been handled. How many man-years have I wasted classifying, storing and safeguarding information like this when I could have been so much more efficient by just blasting this out over Twitter or AOL Instant Messenger?! \n\nThanks also to the senior administration officials, including the Vice President who reaffirmed that this is no big deal by actively supportingtt the use of Signal for this type of discussion and not raising any concerns whatsoever. Truly a model for all of us to follow. \n\nWhat a fool I’ve been. \n\nEdit: if you’re looking for a Biden/Clinton lover, look elsewhere. I’m on record here as saying they should be held accountable. \n\nBut also remember: if [Tu Quoque](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/tu-quoque) is your only defense, you’re losing your argument. ",

    "title": "Op-ed: Hold Fast: A recently retired senior Officer’s take on the recent turmoil in our armed forces.",
    "text": "\nI take my retired privilege again to speak out on issues that are important to me. The views expressed here are my own and increasingly do not reflect the policies of the Navy or the Department of Defense.\n\nOn Friday, two of our nation’s finest military leaders—General Charles Q. Brown and Admiral Lisa Franchetti—were summarily dismissed. These were not pencil-pushing brass; they were proven warfighters, leaders with unshakable dedication to service at the highest levels.\n\nThey were not fired because of job performance. Both had distinguished careers. Under Admiral Franchetti’s leadership, the Navy’s performance in the Red Sea proved that our surface anti-air warfare capabilities are not only effective against scores of asymmetric threats but also that our investment in surface ballistic missile defense was worth every dollar.\n\nSome may point to mishaps under Franchetti’s tenure, but those critics ignore a glaring inconsistency: Why was the Army Chief of Staff not also dismissed, despite overseeing more mishaps with greater loss of life over the same time period? Again, the answer is simple: this was never about job performance.\n\nWe have now entered a new phase of this administration—one that prioritizes ideological purity over competence. It is a purge, a systematic effort to rid the military of those who do not fit the administration’s narrow and dangerous vision of military strength: one that is hyper-masculine, racially homogenous, and blindly obedient.\n\nTo be even more direct—General Brown was dismissed because he is Black and had the audacity to discuss how his blackness led to struggles in his life. Admiral Franchetti was dismissed because she is a woman and had the audacity to speak in support of women’s roles in the modern armed forces.\n\nThe administration’s defenders will argue these leaders were too focused on “DEI, not lethality.” Yet, they conveniently ignore that the Army and Air Force had the exact same diversity programs as the Navy. They ignore that the Army had a higher percentage of transgender service members than the Navy. They ignore that as recently as last fall, the Army Chief of Staff publicly stated, “Without diversity, a homogeneous team of soldiers would lack the resilience, perspective, and growth offered by teammates from different backgrounds.”\n\nAnd yet, he remains while Franchetti is dismissed.\n\n“But they serve at the pleasure of the President, he can decide who he wants!”, is something I’ve heard throughout. That is not what is being questioned here. Nobody denies the President has this right. The real question is, “Why does the president’s pleasure align with racism and misogyny?”  Of the 8 serving joint chiefs, why were only the female and black members dismissed?  Why was the female 3-star general who acts as Chief of Staff for SECDEF fired, but none of the male 3-stars? It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the pattern. \n\nFurther, the firing of the top JAG officers is equally disconcerting. As the SECDEF said this morning, he fired them because he didn’t want lawyers who would “attempt to be roadblocks”. This is an abrogation of the rule of law. It is a chilling sign that controversial and possibly illegal activities are forthcoming and the administration does not want lawyers who will stand in the way of their plans  \n\nThese firings mark a turning point. Loyalty is no longer measured by allegiance to the Constitution but to the administration’s ideology. Stray from it, and you risk your career—or worse. That the Administration has nominated for CJCS Air Force Lieutenant General Dan Caine, an under qualified officer in need of a waiver, undercuts the meritocracy argument. That this officer said to President Trump, in Trump’s own words, “I love you, Sir…I would kill for you…” confirms that ideological purity is our new threshold. \n\nThis is not just outrageous; it is immoral. It is un-American.\n\nMany have chosen to resign rather than serve under these conditions. That, of course, is exactly what this administration wants—a strategic purge designed to drive out those who believe in the rule of law and replace them with those who will obey without question.\n\nBut I urge my fellow service members: Do not give them what they want.\n\nWhich brings me to the question I’ve been asked over and over: What do we do?\n\nI have two words for you:\n\nHold. Fast.\n\nRemember your oath. Remember what it means to serve this nation, not a political faction. But be smart. Protect yourselves.\n\nHow to Stay Safe While Standing Your Ground\n\n1. Stay Under the Radar\n\n   •   Avoid public criticism, especially in official channels or on social media. Assume anything you say online can and will be traced back to you. This includes Reddit.  Could people diss out who you are based on what you’ve shared here?\n\n   •   In public, maintain a neutral—or if necessary, mildly supportive—demeanor.\n\n   •   Remove bumper stickers, yard signs, or anything that identifies your political leanings. Your spouse and family should also be cautious about social media.\n\n2. Choose Your Allies Carefully\n\n   •   There are like-minded people in the ranks, but trust must be earned. The walls have ears.\n\n   •   Be discreet in conversations. Small, non-committal statements can help gauge where others stand before you reveal your own views.\n\n3. Document and Observe\n\n   •   The purge of JAG officers and Inspectors General is no coincidence; it is a deliberate attempt to remove oversight and silence whistleblowers.\n\n   •   If you witness illegal actions or corruption, document everything carefully.\n\n   •   If necessary, leak information to trusted external channels—investigative journalists, oversight committees, or trusted Congresspersons.\n\n4. Stay Informed and Resilient\n\n   •   Propaganda thrives in the absence of truth. Read critically and verify information.\n\n   •   Maintain morale by finding purpose in small victories and supporting fellow shipmates.\n\n   •   Stay physically and mentally prepared for the challenges ahead.\n\nThe Line That Must Never Be Crossed\n\nI remain hopeful that we will never reach the point where service members are ordered to carry out unlawful or immoral directives. I pray that our leadership will intervene before that line is crossed.\n\nBut history has shown that hope alone is not enough. If that day ever comes, we will need men and women in uniform who stand for the rule of law, not the rule of fear.\n\nTo them, I say again: Hold fast.",

    "title": "What's the deal with Pete Hegseth? Am I the only veteran that recognizes this guy's personality?",
    "text": "Can we have a candid discussion on the type of guy SECDEF Hegseth appears to be? Specifically, I’d like to lead off the conversation around his high bar being mediocrity.\n\n Let’s start with his military career. He was an infantry platoon leader for a time. Then it appears he was tasked at the S-9 (Civil Affairs). Then it appears he volunteered to teach COIN in Kabul. Then IRR. Then ARNG in DC.\n\n Let’s unpack this. He’s an infantry officer. But he didn’t complete Ranger School, Airborne School, or Air Assault School – and he was assigned to the 101^(st). Why not? I spent the vast majority of my time in the Army in the heavy side of things (1AD/1CD/18ABN), and as a medical service officer, I completed both Airborne and Air Assault. I struggled to think of a single infantry officer who I’ve met that hasn’t completed at least one of the three – and I could only think of one.\n\nAny junior officer that’s ever served in a BCT can tell you the #1 captain, if not in command, is the AS3. The lower performing folks are put in charge of made up shops – Civil Affairs being an ‘imaginary’ shop in most battalions. Our battalion’s S-9 was staffed by a never-going-to-get-promoted fat Captain and a SFC with DUI and EO problems. Speaking to former peers, that’s the general consensus – the folks in the ‘made up’ shops are the lowest performers. Why was LT/CPT Hegseth put in that position?\n\nThen it appears that CPT Hegseth volunteered to be an instructor of some sort at the COIN academy in Kabul where he taught one class. Again, these classes are typically taught by post-command Captains/early Majors and Master Sergeants. Why would someone with no real experience in COIN be teaching COIN at a theater level? Why would a Captain be working at theater-level if not to keep him out of trouble or because no one would pick him for their team?\n\nThose are the things we know about. Let’s talk about some things that are missing. His highest level of leadership experience appears to be Platoon Leader. His most impactful job appears to be a battalion-level Civil Affairs OIC/AOIC position. In the civilian world, even FoxNews relegated him to the weekend morning show – the doldrums of TV ratings. He apparently parted ways with the charity(s) with which he was affiliated over some alcohol related incidents – and the charities weren’t terribly impactful either.\n\nAfter reading the signal conversation, it reads like a battalion/brigade battle captain briefing his boss. The granularity of the detail and tick-tock of it make it seem like he’s trying to brief an operational leader – not a group of strategic folks. It’s no wonder there aren’t many people chiming into the conversation – they were likely ignoring it because it just wasn’t being briefed to their level. It’s almost like he was trying to get attention – fishing for compliments on DoD’s actions. I don’t know why, but it just sounds so… junior… so inexperienced.\n\nThis is a guy that reads, on paper, like he aspires to mediocrity. He’s the guy that gets 300 on the PT test, does just enough to get out of writing an OPORD, has his subordinates writing their own NCOERs/OERs, manages to always have rumors of him sleeping around but never gets caught. It’s almost like he’s the guy that likes the idea of being in the military without actually *being* in the military. He’s the guy that volunteers to be rear-D commander, but the decision authority makes him the rear-D XO because he can’t be trusted with responsibility. He's the guy that volunteers to be an infantry officer but doesn't want to do any of the \"hard\" schools.  I feel like I know the personality type, because we’ve all worked with them. I think we all know a Pete Hegseth and none of us would call them \"leadership material.\"\n\nSo what’s the deal? Does no one in DoD at the strategy-level see that this guy is… dangerously meh?\n\nEdit: formatting.\n\nEdit 2:  \nMy inbox asked: what would you expect his career to look like?\n\nFor a 20-year infantry officer in his generation, at bare minimum, I would expect airborne or air assault, and ranger school partnered with a company command.\n\nTo keep him in line with his peers...  \nI would expect battalion and/or brigade S-3/XO/DCO time, a significant assignment on a G/J/C-staff, and battalion command. I would expect some time spent in Vicenza or Bragg and the Pentagon or a MACOM. I would expect CCC and ILE.\n\nTo put him ahead of his peers...  \nI would expect to see some SOC time, multiple successful deployments in UOA in leadership positions, maybe a nominative assignment, White House/Congressional fellowship, or a very deep resume of regiment time.",

Wide-eyed, because I couldn’t believe she had the audacity to say that to my face. She quickly backtracked with, “sorry, I shouldn’t have said that joke.” My only response was: “Why would you think that’s funny? Never mind, just get me checked in.” I walked away, later telling a SMSgt volunteer so it could be raised with the event coordinator.\n\nI tried to enjoy the event with my family, and we did, but that exchange left me frustrated, sad, and honestly hopeless. I wear this uniform, which means I’m held to a higher standard. I can’t just unload my thoughts on social media without risking reprisal. I can’t vent in the workplace, because it would disturb good order and discipline. I know I can’t disparage officials.\n\nBut holy hell does it suck when a fellow veteran rips the mask off and shows you they don’t think you belong here.\n\nWell, I do. Fuck you, lady. I belong in this country. Both my parents served. My family has a legacy of service. I’ve served for almost a decade myself, and I’ve earned every damn right to stand here in uniform and call myself American.\n\nI just needed to get this off my chest.",

    "title": "Today marks the anniversary of MSG Benavidez six hours in hell",
    "text": "MOH citation as follows\n\nM/Sgt. (then S/Sgt.) Roy P. Benavidez, United States Army, who distinguished himself by a series of daring and extremely valorous actions on 2 May 1968 while assigned to Detachment B-56, 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces, Republic of Vietnam. On the morning of 2 May 1968, a 12-man Special Forces Reconnaissance Team was inserted by helicopters in a dense jungle area west of Loc Ninh, Vietnam, to gather intelligence information about confirmed large-scale enemy activity. This area was controlled and routinely patrolled by the North Vietnamese Army. After a short period of time on the ground, the team met heavy enemy resistance, and requested emergency extraction. Three helicopters attempted extraction, but were unable to land due to intense enemy small-arms and anti-aircraft fire. Sgt. Benavidez was at the Forward Operating Base in Loc Ninh monitoring the operation by radio when these helicopters returned to off-load wounded crewmembers and to assess aircraft damage. Sgt. Benevidez voluntarily boarded a returning aircraft to assist in another extraction attempt. Realizing that all the team members were either dead or wounded and unable to move to the pickup zone, he directed the aircraft to a nearby clearing while he jumped from the hovering helicopter, and ran approximately 75 meters under withering small-arms fire to the crippled team. Prior to reaching the team's position he was wounded in his right leg, face, and head. Despite these painful injuries, he took charge, repositioning the team members and directing their fire to facilitate the landing of the extraction aircraft and the loading of the wounded and dead team members. He then threw smoke canisters to direct the aircraft to the team's position. Despite his severe wounds and under intense enemy fire, he carried and dragged half of the wounded team members to the awaiting aircraft. He then provided protective fire by running alongside the aircraft as it moved to pick up the remaining team members. As the enemy's fire intensified, he hurried to recover the body and classified documents on the dead team leader. When he reached the leader's body, Sgt. Benevidez was severely wounded by small-arms fire in the abdomen and grenade fragments in his back. At nearly the same moment, the aircraft pilot was mortally wounded, and his helicopter crashed. Although in extremely critical condition due to his multiple wounds, Sgt. Benevidez secured the classified documents and made his way back to the wreckage, where he aided the wounded out of the overturned aircraft, and gathered the stunned survivors into a defensive perimeter. Under increasing enemy automatic-weapons and grenade fire, he moved around the perimeter distributing water and ammunition to his weary men, reinstilling in them a will to live and fight. Facing a buildup of enemy opposition with a beleaguered team, Sgt. Benevidez mustered his strength, began calling in tactical air strikes and directed the fire from supporting gunships to suppress the enemy's fire and so permitted another extraction attempt. He was wounded again in his thigh by small-arms fire while administering first aid to a wounded team member just before another extraction helicopter was able to land. His indomitable spirit kept him going as he began to ferry his comrades to the craft. On his second trip with the wounded, he was clubbed from additional wounds to his head and arms before killing his adversary. He then continued under devastating fire to carry the wounded to the helicopter. Upon reaching the aircraft, he spotted and killed two enemy soldiers who were rushing the craft from an angle that prevented the aircraft door-gunner from firing upon them. With little strength remaining, he made one last trip to the perimeter to ensure that all classified material had been collected or destroyed and to bring in the remaining wounded. Only then, in extremely serious condition from numerous wounds and loss of blood, did he allow himself to be pulled into the extraction aircraft. Sgt. Benevidez' gallant choice to join voluntarily his comrades who were in critical straits, to expose himself constantly to withering enemy fire, and his refusal to be stopped despite numerous severe wounds, saved the lives of at least eight men. His fearless personal leadership, tenacious devotion to duty, and extremely valorous actions in the face of overwhelming odds were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect the utmost credit on him and the United States Army.",

The real kicker is that they had ZERO uniformed escort with them when they were going into rooms. Not the barracks manager, not the staff duty, and not the CQ either.\n\nWell, one soldier had a camera in his room and caught one of the contractors from Georgia Power electric company steal money from him, put it in his pocket, sees the camera, pretends to put the money back, and then tries to kill the feed.\n\nTurns out that does not work when you are dealing with slightly mire tech savvy soldiers.\n\nIn other news, while this work was happening, not only did they NOT have a uniformed escort, they actually prevented soldiers from going into their own barracks rooms while they were there saying said soldiers were not allowed in there. That’s bullshit, but nonetheless, there is no telling if they’ve stolen from other people, both on post and off post too.\n\nStealing from soldiers is particularly disgraceful in image, but this behavior is shameful for the Georgia Power company, the brigade, and anyone who did not see an obvious problem with civilians being in a soldiers’ room unescorted.\n\nFix this shit, CCOE.

    "title": "We need to have a discussion about \"lawful orders\"",
    "text": "The US military is now the only part of the federal government that has an obligation to the rule of law as defined by US code, the US constitution, and international law. Officers, especially those that attend the academies, are well versed in the idea of a lawful vs. unlawful order. However, the enlisted are told what constitutes a lawful order, but are given very little information on what constitutes an unlawful order. So let's have a bit of a refresher.\n\nThere are various criteria to a lawful order, but all orders need to follow 3 basic criteria:\n\n* Legal under US law\n* Legal under the US constitution\n* Legal under international law\n\nThese are the 3 masters under which you will be judged if you transmit or perform an unlawful order. Normally, US law and US constitution would be in the same bullet point, as the constitution is the supreme law of the land. However, as I said before, these are unprecedented times. International law is important here as well. The US is a signatory to \\*most\\* of the Geneva Conventions. However, even if a nation is not a signatory to a certain part, you can still be tried under international law for following or transmitting an unlawful order.\n\nSo, for example, there's a group of protesters gathering outside a federal building late at night. The executive would like the crowd to disperse. Here's 4 potential orders that are within the current realm of possibility:\n\n* \"Under the Insurrection Act, I authorize the use of federal troops to assist law enforcement in restoring order, ensuring protection of federal property, and enforcing curfews in accordance with federal and state laws.\"\n\nWhile not exactly well liked, this is certainly legal in the US. It was used in Minneapolis, when the National Guard was used to help police enforce curfews after Floyd was murdered. In this case, anyone caught by the Guard was arrested by the police - they were there to assist, not enforce.\n\n* \"I Order federal troops to conduct arrests of protesters for violating local curfew laws.\"\n\nThis is an unlawful order under federal law (18 U.S.C. § 1385), but not under constitutional or international law. The US military cannot be used as a police force to enforce local, state, or federal laws. It would require an act of congress, not an order from the executive, to make this order legal. You have the **right** and the **duty** to **refuse** this order, and to refuse to **transmit** this order.\n\n* \"Use live ammunition and lethal force to disperse the protesters, regardless of whether they pose a threat.\"\n\nDisregarding federal law, this is a violation of the US constitution, as an unreasonable seizure under the 4th amendment and a deprivation of due process under the 5th amendment. Again, You have the **right** and the **duty** to **refuse** this order, and to refuse to **transmit** this order.\n\n* \"I designate the protesters as terrorists and enemy combatants, and they should be treated as such\"\n\nThis is illegal in many ways, but especially under international law; specifically the fourth Geneva Convention. You have the **right** and the **duty** to **refuse** this order, and to refuse to **transmit** this order.\n\nWhile these scenarios may seem silly, there is a large part of the US population that is genuinely afraid of these outcomes. The US military is the strongest, smartest, and best war fighting force the world has ever seen, and it is our responsibility to hold ourselves to a higher standard than those in charge may hold themselves to.\n\n**\\*\\*this post was written to be apolitical. Let's keep it that way and keep the mods happy.**",

An Airman or NCO can take care of the dog on off-time as an additional duty. It should also go without saying that these dogs would likely be different breeds and receive different training than your typical military working dog on account of their relatively relaxed day-to-day routine. \n\nThis seems like a great way to increase morale, make people excited to come to work, and provide extra volunteer/training opportunities to members. \n\nI understand that obviously not all units would be capable of having a dog at their shop/office, but it seems like something that could do a lot of good for increasing morale/motivation among troops with relatively little cost and risk.\n\nLet me hear your thoughts",

    "title": "SWO6 Op-ed. To the many people that asked me: Yes, shooting at unarmed people in the water violates the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Armed Conflict. If you are ever ordered to do this, you must refuse, because it is illegal.",
    "text": "There is a lot of debate about what legal, what’s illegal, what should you do, and what you should refuse, but for this scenario, that is my answer. \n\nI don’t  know if the allegation is true. The Pentagon denies it, and I truly hope that is the case. But what is true, and what every one of you should understand, is what the law actually says.\n\nWe’ve already been round and round about the legality of shooting at drug-running boats. Under virtually every interpretation of international maritime law, it is probably illegal.   I myself would put it at 99 percent. The administration may believe it has a legal argument, but every credible voice I know of disagrees, including all of our allies and partners. That should tell you something.\n\nBut this second issue of “double tapping” or taking no prisoners is not a gray area. Not legally, not morally, not ethically.\n\nShooting at unarmed people in the water, after their vessel has been disabled or sunk, is unlawful. Full stop.\n\nThere is no “interpretation” of the Geneva Conventions or the Law of Armed Conflict that makes this permissible. There is no loophole, no operational necessity clause, no presidential or SECWAR prerogative. It is an act expressly prohibited and it has been for more than a century.\n\nAt the Naval War College, we discussed this exact scenario when studying World War I and World War II submarine warfare. Back then, there were several instances where a submarine would torpedo a ship and then circle back to fire on survivors in the water. Those incidents were part of the reason why we have the Geneva Conventions in the first place \n\nThey’re also why the Conventions explicitly classify shipwreck survivors as “de facto hors de combat.” That means “out of the fight” because they are wounded, detained, incapacitated, or in the water with no ability to wage war. They must be treated as noncombatants. Always.\n\nHere is the relevant language, straight from Article III, which every service member should know:\n\n“ (1) Persons taking no active part in the hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed 'hors de combat' by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause, shall in all circumstances be treated humanely, without any adverse distinction founded on race, colour, religion or faith, sex, birth or wealth, or any other similar criteria.\n\nTo this end, the following acts are and shall remain prohibited at any time and in any place whatsoever with respect to the above-mentioned persons:\n(a) violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture;\n(b) taking of hostages;\n(c) outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment;\n(d) the passing of sentences and the carrying out of executions without previous judgment pronounced by a regularly constituted court, affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples.\n\n(2) The wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for.”\n\nNote the phrase “at any time and in any place.” No exceptions. The law is intentionally absolute to prevent exactly the kind of atrocity we are discussing. Also note the “wounded and sick shall be collected and cared for” clause. Nothing about shooting them in the water for expediency.\n\nA classmate once asked, “Well, what if the President pardons you?”\n\nOur instructor responded immediately: “That pardon would carry no weight before an international war-crimes tribunal.”\n\nThat is the reality. You cannot be pardoned for violating the laws of war. “Just following orders” is not a defense. It wasn’t at Nuremberg. It isn’t now.\n\nSo, in sum: I’m relieved the Pentagon denies this happened, because if it had, it would be prima facie illegal under every relevant body of law.\n\nAnd let me be crystal clear for anyone on active duty:\n\nIf ordered to shoot unarmed survivors in the water, you must refuse.\n\nNot as an act of protest, but as a legal obligation.\n\nNot as a matter of politics, but as a matter of civilized behavior and humanity.\n\nAnd this law is there for a reason. You wouldn’t want it to happen to you if the shoe was on the other foot, and you shouldn’t want it to happen to others. That’s not who we are as mariners.",

    "text": "I just got interrogated by OSI for some of the content that I post on this website. Some of you know that I like to make memes and post on this sub regularly. Well, some of the content that I have posted seems to have ruffled some feathers and caused a formal investigation. \n\nLet me tell you that it was the most surreal experience going to an interrogation room, and having memes that you've made being presented to you while Special Agents grill you about silly memes you've concocted. \n\nWhat memes were so crazy or over-the-line that AFOSI had to get involved? Good question. They brought up a handful, but ones like [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1bjc286/its_the_worst_part_about_the_af_pt_test/), [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/196ie9e/out_of_control/), and [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1kvt92i/happy_memorial_day/) were what the interrogation centered on most. They even went after some [shitposts](https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/19ai4dk/flight_med/) I've made in the past. Leave it to autistic OSI to go deep into your post history\n\nI could not wrap my head around what was going on, I kept thinking \"I cannot believe this is happening. Is this real life? what the fuck is going on?\" That's when a bigass loch ness monster slapped the tree fiddy right out of my hand and told me to get a grip.\n\nThey kept asking me questions about when I make memes, how I come up with them, who the audience is for, do I use AI to make memes (insulting) and shitposts. I answered truthfully to all their questions, which seemed to make things go smoother.\n\nThey brough up charges citing the UCMJ. Articles 88, 89, 91, and 133 were all \"airtight\" they said. Nothing has been brought against me \\*yet\\* but I definitely fucked up. I was just trying to do the right thing by being cooperative but I ABSOLUTELY SHOULD'VE JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP AND ASK FOR A LAWYER.\n\nAnyway, I'll post again for followup whenever something formal happens. Just let this be a lesson to everyone: even if you think you're innocent and did nothing wrong, STFU and get a lawyer. I'm sure they'll try to guilt trip you, but your career and livelihood are at stake, so get the protection you deserve and are entitled to.\n\nBLOB: AFOSI brought OP in for interrogation for posting on Reddit.",

    "text": "I don't really know how to reddit, and don't really ever make any posts, but recent events have me feeling so disappointed I feel the need to say something. From speaking with my veteran patients, I am hopeful there are some that may feel the same way, as well.\n\nAs most of you may be aware of, recent attacks on the federal workforce are having an effect on the VA system. It's almost like bleeding out from the inside. The 1000 employees that recently were laid off is just the tip of the iceberg. A week or two ago supervisors had to report who was within their probationary 2 year period still-- likely aiming to fire/unhire them. Although the frontline clinical staff were spared to some extent for now, they seem to be crippling us by getting rid of our administrative staff and not allowing us to hire any. They serve an essential role in keeping the clinics and hospitals running. Without their work for patient scheduling, supplies/inventory management, upkeep/maintenance, timekeeping, etc., we will eventually crumble.\n\nI spend my days working with my medical team and we barely have any room to eat or have a bathroom break, but seeing you all come in sick and discharging from the hospital feeling better is worth it all. The VA was my dream job since graduating residency and I am blessed and happy to work here. I hope you can empathize with me when I think that an email from OPM asking me to describe what I did last week to be an absolute waste of time. Time that I could be using to care for the vets instead.\n\n**For those of you who are vets who believe in the VA and the care it gives, I implore you to go to your town halls, to call your senators and house representatives, get your voice out there and let people know if you want to see the VA as an essential part of your healthcare. If this post gets even a few of you guys more active to get your voice out and be heard, I'll consider it a success.  I just don't want to see this place go down without a fight.**\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the awards and kind words. Since this post was made, it became official that they've let go 1400 \"probationary\" (i.e. hired within 2 years). These people were \\*indiscriminately\\* fired and was not merit based. They claimed these people were not providing veteran care but there was a joint congressional hearing yesterday (link below) that details doctors and prosthetics staff getting let go at another VA. On top of this, it was estimated that hundreds of vets themselves were let go.  Mike Bost (senator and chairman) seems to be more focused on gaslighting these concerns rather than providing actual answers to why VA staff and namely veterans are being let go. Watch for yourself, its rather infuriating.\n\n[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVj7w3Mzvhk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVj7w3Mzvhk)",

    "title": "Refusing an Unlawful Military Order: Your Legal Duty, Your Constitutional Right, and the Courage That Defines True Service",
    "text": "Many U.S. service members are never told this clearly enough, or at all:\n\n&gt; You are not only allowed to refuse an unlawful order — you are obligated to.\n\nThis is not insubordination. It’s not desertion. It’s not weakness.\nIt is a legally protected act of courage that upholds the very oath you swore to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis post lays out everything:\n\n- What counts as an unlawful order\n- The exact UCMJ articles and their full legal language\n- Real-world military court precedents\n- Interpretations from military law\n- Resources and steps to protect yourself and others\n\nIf you're serving and something doesn’t feel right, or if you’ve ever wondered, *“Would I be punished for refusing an illegal command?”*, read this. The law is on your side.\n\n\n---\n\n### What Makes an Order Unlawful?\n\nAn unlawful order is any order that:\n\n- Violates U.S. federal law or the Constitution\n- Violates international law (such as the Geneva Conventions)\n- Requires or leads to war crimes, torture, violence against civilians, or discriminatory actions\n- Has no legitimate military objective or is abusive\n\n&gt; Department of Defense Law of War Manual, Section 18.6.1:\n&gt; \"Members of the armed forces are bound to obey only lawful orders. An order that violates the law of war is unlawful and must not be obeyed.\"\n\n\n---\n\n### UCMJ: What the Law Says\n\n**Article 90 – Willfully Disobeying a Superior Commissioned Officer**\n10 U.S. Code § 890\n&gt; \"Any person subject to this chapter who willfully disobeys a *lawful command* of that person's superior commissioned officer shall be punished...\"\n\n**Key:** This only applies to *lawful* commands.\n\n\n---\n\n**Article 91 – Insubordination Toward Warrant, NCO, or Petty Officer**\n10 U.S. Code § 891\n&gt; \"...willfully disobeys the *lawful order* of a warrant officer, noncommissioned officer, or petty officer...\"\n\n**Key:** Again, the term *lawful* is crucial. Unlawful orders are not protected by this article.\n\n\n---\n\n**Article 92 – Failure to Obey Order or Regulation**\n10 U.S. Code § 892\n&gt; \"Any person... who violates or fails to obey any *lawful* general order or regulation... shall be punished...\"\n\n**Key:** Lawful orders only. Refusal of an unlawful order is *not* a violation.\n\n\n---\n\n### Real Cases That Set the Standard\n\n**United States v. Calley (1971) – My Lai Massacre**\nLt. William Calley was convicted for murdering unarmed Vietnamese civilians under orders.\n&gt; *Verdict:* Following manifestly unlawful orders is not a defense.\n\n\n---\n\n**United States v. Keenan (1969)**\nPfc. Keenan killed a civilian under a direct order from a sergeant.\n&gt; *Court ruling:*\n&gt; \"A soldier is not a robot. He is a reasoning agent. The law does not permit a soldier to obey an order that he knows, or should know, is illegal.\"\n\n\n---\n\n### Nuremberg Principle IV (International Law)\n\n&gt; \"The fact that a person acted pursuant to the order of his Government or of a superior does not relieve him from responsibility under international law, provided a moral choice was in fact possible to him.\"\n\n**Takeaway:** If you can recognize that an order is wrong, you're not only allowed to refuse — you're expected to.\n\n\n---\n\n### What to Do If You Receive an Unlawful Order\n\n1. **Ask for clarification**\nPolitely ask the superior to explain how the order aligns with UCMJ or ROE.\n\n\n2. **Document everything**\nKeep records: time, date, location, order content, witnesses, and your response.\n\n\n3. **Report it**\nUse your chain of command or report directly to the Inspector General (IG).\n\n\n4. **Get legal help immediately**\nRequest a JAG attorney. Do not provide statements until you’ve been advised.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n### Legal Protection for Refusal and Reporting\n\nYou are legally protected from retaliation for reporting unlawful actions.\n\n**10 U.S. Code § 1034 – Military Whistleblower Protection Act**\nProtects service members who report:\n- Illegal orders\n- Violations of UCMJ or federal law\n- Fraud, abuse, or misconduct\n\n\n---\n\n### Support Organizations You Can Contact\n\n**GI Rights Hotline**\n- Website: `https://girightshotline.org`\n- Phone: `1-877-447-4487`\nFree, confidential legal and discharge help.\n\n**Military Law Task Force (MLTF)**\n- Website: `https://nlgmltf.org`\nAssistance with refusing orders, whistleblowing, and CO status.\n\n**Center on Conscience &amp; War**\n- Website: `https://centeronconscience.org`\nCO support and DoD Form 5305 guidance.\n\n**National Whistleblower Center**\n- Website: `https://www.whistleblowers.org`\nWhistleblower protection and legal advocacy.\n\n\n---\n\n### Mental and Emotional Support\n\nYou’re not weak for being stressed — this is serious. These resources exist to support your well-being:\n\n- **Military OneSource** – `1-800-342-9647` (free, 24/7 counseling)\n- **VA Vet Centers** – Mental health, trauma, and moral injury help\n- **Chaplains** – 100% confidential spiritual support\n\n\n---\n\n### Legal and Moral Foundations at a Glance\n\n- UCMJ Articles 90, 91, 92: Only lawful orders are enforceable\n- DoD Law of War Manual § 18.6.1: Duty to disobey unlawful orders\n- Nuremberg Principle IV: You’re personally accountable under international law\n- 10 U.S. Code § 1034: You are protected if you speak out\n\n\n---\n\n### Final Message to All Service Members\n\nYou did not swear an oath to a commander.\nYou swore an oath to defend the Constitution of the United States.\n\nFollowing a clearly unlawful order doesn’t protect you — it makes you legally and morally responsible.\n\nRefusing such an order is not insubordination. It is:\n\n- Leadership\n- Honor\n- Courage\n- Constitutionally backed military service\n\nIf you or someone you know is in this situation: speak up, write it down, seek support, and do not stay silent.\n\nYou are not alone. You are protected. And you are doing the right thing.\n\n\n#Please share, repost, and spread this to heip educate support, and save our brothers and sisters in arms from becoming victims of ignorance",

    "text": "Throwaway because people watch my account. I’ll keep it short, I’m commissioning in a few months after being enlisted for 6 years. I was pretty excited and I dropped an afsc that made me go for the PRP screening stuff. Well, I got dropped and reclassed into a different job because I failed the screening. Upside? The job I got reclassed into is also pretty great so really I’m happy with both outcomes. The downside? Well I found out why I got dropped and reclassed. \n\nSee before I started my commissioning process I was coming off my second deployment. My then ex-wife was an unfaithful spouse and cheating on me. I had no idea what to do, she was leaving me for another man, my world was falling apart and the family we had worked on building together for 8 years was coming apart and nothing I could do would save it. My closest family was thousands of miles away so I was all by myself. So I sought counseling to help me navigate the marital issues, the divorce and the emotional grief afterwards. \n\nFor clarification, I was never diagnosed with anything. I was never prescribed any medicine. I was never assigned an official doctor/psychiatrist/therapist. I purely went for counseling sessions. And it was enough to get me canned before I even started the training pipeline. \n\nJust makes me angry beyond belief. I remember a tech sgt in my org who finally got her dream orders to Hawaii and her orders were dropped because of her depression. I have a friend in my commissioning program who’s facing getting dropped because he sought mental help once as an airman. Same boat as me, no diagnosis, no docs, no meds. Like I don’t know what the Air Force wants from me. Am I supposed to just smile and wave while the love of my life rails another man? I’m so fucking sorry I needed help overcoming one of the biggest hurdles that life can throw at you. And I sure as hell wasn’t gonna waltz into my shirts office and go “Hey bro you want to hear about how I was alone on Christmas while my wife was banging Jodie?”\n\nI’m frustrated beyond belief. Again, silver lining. I love both jobs. I’m just mad that it’s affected my career trajectory. ",

We’ve been talking about this for months, and last night it finally began.\n\nThey started with the Chair of the Joint Chiefs, General CQ Brown. They followed with Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Lisa Franchetti and Air Force Vice Chief of Staff General James Slife.\n\nBut they didn’t stop there.\n\nTrump and Hegseth also purged the Judge Advocates General for the Army, Navy, and Air Force. JAG officers interpret and determine lawful and constitutional orders. Replacing career JAG officers with loyalists is essential to Trump’s overall goal of a Military dedicated not to the Constitution, but to him alone.\n\nTo put it bluntly, our adversaries are popping champagne right now. There is no better outcome for them than the promotion of Trump loyalists over the best and brightest. They know that this move makes our Military weaker.\n\nThe real concern is what comes next. Trump has made his intentions clear. He has openly signaled his intent to ignore the Constitution, he has attacked democratic processes and elections for the better part of a decade, and the actions he and Elon Musk have taken over the last four weeks openly defy longstanding Constitutional order.\n\nThis is a dangerous moment, and we have to be ready for whatever happens.",

    "title": "Op-ed: Hold Fast: A recently retired senior naval Officer’s take on the recent turmoil in our armed forces.",
    "text": "\nI take my retired privilege again to speak out on issues that are important to me. The views expressed here are my own and increasingly do not reflect the policies of the Navy or the Department of Defense.\n\nOn Friday, two of our nation’s finest military leaders—General Charles Q. Brown and Admiral Lisa Franchetti—were summarily dismissed. These were not pencil-pushing brass; they were proven warfighters, leaders with unshakable dedication to service at the highest levels.\n\nThey were not fired because of job performance. Both had distinguished careers. Under Admiral Franchetti’s leadership, the Navy’s performance in the Red Sea proved that our surface anti-air warfare capabilities are not only effective against scores of asymmetric threats but also that our investment in surface ballistic missile defense was worth every dollar.\n\nSome may point to mishaps under Franchetti’s tenure, but those critics ignore a glaring inconsistency: Why was the Army Chief of Staff not also dismissed, despite overseeing more mishaps with greater loss of life over the same time period? Again, the answer is simple: this was never about job performance.\n\nWe have now entered a new phase of this administration—one that prioritizes ideological purity over competence. It is a purge, a systematic effort to rid the military of those who do not fit the administration’s narrow and dangerous vision of military strength: one that is hyper-masculine, racially homogenous, and blindly obedient.\n\nTo be even more direct—General Brown was dismissed because he is Black and had the audacity to discuss how his blackness led to struggles in his life. Admiral Franchetti was dismissed because she is a woman and had the audacity to speak in support of women’s roles in the modern armed forces.\n\nThe administration’s defenders will argue these leaders were too focused on “DEI, not lethality.” Yet, they conveniently ignore that the Army and Air Force had the exact same diversity programs as the Navy. They ignore that the Army had a higher percentage of transgender service members than the Navy. They ignore that as recently as last fall, the Army Chief of Staff publicly stated, “Without diversity, a homogeneous team of soldiers would lack the resilience, perspective, and growth offered by teammates from different backgrounds.”\n\nAnd yet, he remains while Franchetti is dismissed.\n\n“But they serve at the pleasure of the President, he can decide who he wants!”, is something I’ve heard throughout. That is not what is being questioned here. Nobody denies the President has this right. The real question is, “Why does the president’s pleasure align with racism and misogyny?”  Of the 8 serving joint chiefs, why were only the female and black members dismissed?  Why was the female 3-star general who acts as Chief of Staff for SECDEF fired, but none of the male 3-stars? It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to see the pattern. \n\nFurther, the firing of the top JAG officers is equally disconcerting. As the SECDEF said this morning, he fired them because he didn’t want lawyers who would “attempt to be roadblocks”. This is an abrogation of the rule of law. It is a chilling sign that controversial and possibly illegal activities are forthcoming and the administration does not want lawyers who will stand in the way of their plans  \n\nThese firings mark a turning point. Loyalty is no longer measured by allegiance to the Constitution but to the administration’s ideology. Stray from it, and you risk your career—or worse. That the Administration has nominated for CJCS Air Force Lieutenant General Dan Caine, an under qualified officer in need of a waiver, undercuts the meritocracy argument. That this officer said to President Trump, in Trump’s own words, “I love you, Sir…I would kill for you…” confirms that ideological purity is our new threshold. \n\nThis is not just outrageous; it is immoral. It is un-American.\n\nMany have chosen to resign rather than serve under these conditions. That, of course, is exactly what this administration wants—a strategic purge designed to drive out those who believe in the rule of law and replace them with those who will obey without question.\n\nBut I urge my fellow service members: Do not give them what they want.\n\nWhich brings me to the question I’ve been asked over and over: What do we do?\n\nI have two words for you:\n\nHold. Fast.\n\nRemember your oath. Remember what it means to serve this nation, not a political faction. But be smart. Protect yourselves.\n\nHow to Stay Safe While Standing Your Ground\n\n1. Stay Under the Radar\n\n   •   Avoid public criticism, especially in official channels or on social media. Assume anything you say online can and will be traced back to you. This includes Reddit.  Could people diss out who you are based on what you’ve shared here?\n\n   •   In public, maintain a neutral—or if necessary, mildly supportive—demeanor.\n\n   •   Remove bumper stickers, yard signs, or anything that identifies your political leanings. Your spouse and family should also be cautious about social media.\n\n2. Choose Your Allies Carefully\n\n   •   There are like-minded people in the ranks, but trust must be earned. The walls have ears.\n\n   •   Be discreet in conversations. Small, non-committal statements can help gauge where others stand before you reveal your own views.\n\n3. Document and Observe\n\n   •   The purge of JAG officers and Inspectors General is no coincidence; it is a deliberate attempt to remove oversight and silence whistleblowers.\n\n   •   If you witness illegal actions or corruption, document everything carefully.\n\n   •   If necessary, leak information to trusted external channels—investigative journalists, oversight committees, or trusted Congresspersons.\n\n4. Stay Informed and Resilient\n\n   •   Propaganda thrives in the absence of truth. Read critically and verify information.\n\n   •   Maintain morale by finding purpose in small victories and supporting fellow shipmates.\n\n   •   Stay physically and mentally prepared for the challenges ahead.\n\nThe Line That Must Never Be Crossed\n\nI remain hopeful that we will never reach the point where service members are ordered to carry out unlawful or immoral directives. I pray that our leadership will intervene before that line is crossed.\n\nBut history has shown that hope alone is not enough. If that day ever comes, we will need men and women in uniform who stand for the rule of law, not the rule of fear.\n\nTo them, I say again: Hold fast.",

    "title": "I got out and got my VA rating of 90%. This post is a PSA to let you know that you can too.",
    "text": "BLUF: Be proactive about your health, always go to medical even for small stuff, stay on top of your claim when it comes time to get out.\n\nSo after getting out and biting my nails waiting for the slow ass VA to get around to me, I finally received my rating of 90% last night. \n\nI’m pretty stoked, and was expecting 50-60%. \n\nBut I’ve heard and seen plenty of others get a way worse rating that didn’t reflect their actual physical condition after leaving the service. \n\nSo whether you’re 18 years away from getting out or 2 years away, let me offer some advice and get you thinking about this during your career. \n\n1. GO TO MEDICAL\n\nI can’t stress this enough. When I was an airman, my NCOs were always telling me that if I was hurt or wanted to be seen, then to make an appointment and go. When I became an NCO, I did the same for my troops. \n\nThe reasons for this are if you’re hurting, you should go to a doctor, simple enough. And also to document your problems. I have a 0% rating for a few issues that aren’t causing me problems now, but might in the future, and I have years of appointments for. \n\nWhat helps get a high rating for a reoccurring issue is a **history of attempts to fix**, and **no resolution**. \n\nFor example: \n\nYou’re practicing running for the new PT test. Over the next few months, you notice your knee getting stiffer and stiffer, and feeling worse and worse after every run. So you make an appointment. \n\nOf course the doc gives you the usual. Take it easy, here’s an NSAID prescription, ice it, do some stretches. A few months later, still hurting. So you make another appointment. Then they send you to phys therapy, give you a profile to rest it, maybe a referral off base, give you a brace, etc. \n\nA couple years of this and still no major improvement, all the while you have regular appointments every few months. Eventually you’re back on both feet. You can run and stuff but it still hurts, so you make an appointment to document it, and just have to deal with it forever now, but still regular make appointments when it’s hurting. \n\nSo there’s an obvious progression. Onset of issue, attempts to fix it, time passing, worsening of symptoms, more drastic measures, and still no resolution. This is what contributes to high ratings. \n\n2. Do a BDD (benefits deliverable at discharge)\n\nWhat is your date of retirement/separation? Now subtract 7 months. That is the day you should request your medical records, create an account in va.gov, and set up your ID.me. Then at 180 days prior to separating, you upload your records and make your claim. You can look through your medical records and see your problem areas and make a list to help, and you’ll probably already have a few in mind by then. \n\nIF YOU WAIT TOO LONG, you will be placed on the back burner, and might not get your claim approved or start receiving benefits until a year after you retire/separate. \n\n3. CLAIM EVERYTHING\n\nYou can claim anything. It doesn’t have to be previously documented. When filing you can remember the time you were playing flight touch football and got hit and knocked out for a second. Claim it. Worst they can say is no, and now you have documentation of a head injury. Get headaches sometimes? Claim it. Something hurting after lifting? Claim it. \n\nYou’re not lying or over exaggerating, you are documenting times you were hurting during your service, exactly what the VA is for.\n\n4. Meet with your VA advisor. \n\nThey will be on base or nearby. They will come to your TAP class. Get their card, set up a meeting, and pepper them with questions. They are going to be a lifeline helping you navigate this headache of a process. They will have the answers to timelines and forms and more. I set up a bi-weekly appointment with mine, and was still finding out new things every time I met with him that helped. \n\n5. When you go to your evaluation appointments, use the Master Condition List\n\nhttps://www.veteransbenefitskb.com/master\n\nThis is a list of every issue you can claim. It also has diagrams explaining how rating percentages are decided. \n\nWhen you go for your evaluation appointments, you will have already looked up your issues and where you fall on the diagrams/descriptors so you can describe your problems effectively to the evaluator. \n\nREMEMBER: Your evaluations aren’t about how you feel right now. They are about how bad your issue is on your **worst day**. Describe them in full to get an accurate diagnosis.\n\n6. Remember that the evaluators are on your side\n\nAs much shit as the VA gets, something like 80% of the VA are veterans. Their policies are to decide things in favor of the veteran, not to pinch pennies. \n\nI got 10% for a couple things that I didn’t even think I would, I just wanted them in my record. \n\n. . .\n\nIn summation, be proactive. No one is going to fight for you better than you. If something hurts, go get seen. If it still hurts, go get seen again. Even if every time you go they give you ibuprofen and tell you to stretch it, you will have a thick file on it, bolstering your claim. When you get to the end of your career you should file a claim. Even if you were only in for 4 years, that’s 4 years of accumulated aches and pains. Even if you get a 0% rating for it, in 20 years you can go back and get it reevaluated. \n\nYou’re going to have a lot to do as you get ready to take off the uniform. Moving, TMO, work turnover, MPF outprocessing, SkillBridge, kids, pets, whatever. But your VA claim should be at the top of your priority list. You can knock it out 6 months prior to your ETS, and that 6 months out date should be an important one for you. \n\nIf anyone has any other advice I missed or wants to point out a mistake I made, please do. If you have any questions, drop ‘em below.\n\n",

    "title": "PSA to Veterans: Please Stop Bragging About Your Disability.",
    "text": "Edit: Since there seems to be a misunderstanding. I like to state that this happened on Twitter.\n\nEdit 2:Bragging typically involves boasting in a way that tries to elevate oneself, often to make others feel lesser. On the other hand, a discussion is just sharing facts or experiences without that sense of superiority.\n\nHey everyone, I wanted to share something that’s been on my mind after a frustrating (but also kind of hilarious) interaction with a fellow veteran online. I think it’s important we all take a second to think about how we talk about our VA disability compensation, especially in public spaces where civilians are watching.\n\nHere’s what happened:\n\nThis veteran was bragging about getting $3,000 a month for their 90% disability rating (which is already exaggerated because, let’s be real, that number doesn’t add up unless you’ve got a bunch of dependents or extra compensation and they admitted to be single and childless). They were flaunting it like a badge of honor, even saying they didn’t need the money and just save it. Meanwhile, the thread they were commenting on was full of civilians venting about their financial struggles.\n\nWhen I pointed out, as a fellow disabled veteran, that not everyone is as fortunate to receive compensation and that bragging like this only creates resentment, they doubled down. They went on about how they “earned” it and how other veterans who don’t get benefits just need to “try harder.”\n\nHere’s the kicker—they also tried to act like their disability was purely physical, saying, “How do you know it’s mental and not physical?” But their behavior made it painfully obvious. Let’s be honest: if you’re bragging like this and saying you don’t need the money, there’s a good chance your mental health rating is doing the heavy lifting. No one missing a leg or dealing with chronic physical pain is out here saying, “I don’t even need the money.”\n\nLook, I get it—we all handle our disabilities differently, and we’ve earned the benefits we receive. But bragging about it in public spaces is not only tone-deaf—it’s dangerous. Civilians already don’t fully understand the VA system, and seeing this kind of behavior only makes them resent veterans more. It makes us all look bad. Worse, it gives ammo to people pushing for budget cuts to VA programs by reinforcing the idea that “veterans don’t really need it.”\n\nSo here’s my PSA:\n\nDon’t brag about your disability rating or how much money you get.\n\nDon’t say you don’t need it. Even if you’re fortunate enough to save the money, remember that others rely on it to survive.\n\nBe mindful of the context. If you’re in a public thread full of civilians struggling, that’s not the time to flex your benefits.\n\n\nWe owe it to ourselves and to each other to handle these conversations with tact and humility. If you’ve got something to say about your rating, keep it in spaces where it’s relevant and understood—like veteran forums—not in public threads where it just creates hostility.\n\nLet’s not ruin the system for those who genuinely need it.\n\n\n",

    "text": "Sir,\n\nI respectfully write in response to your memorandum dated April 7, 2025, which rescinds the blanket designation of military family days.\n\nI fully understand and support the Department’s commitment to lethality and readiness. However, I urge us to consider the very foundation of that readiness—our people. In this age of constant connectivity, the average Airman doesn’t stop working at the end of the duty day. Collaboration tools, mobile access, laptops, and BYOD policies have made every moment a potential recall. For many, there’s no true off-switch.\n\nBy removing designated family days, we risk sending a message that continuous productivity outweighs the wellbeing of our most vital resource—our Airmen and their families. What was once a tangible sign of appreciation and balance now feels like another expectation to do more, with less.\n\nWe are already leading the Department of Defense in suicide rates. The cancellation of family days, while seemingly administrative, chips away at morale, recovery, and retention. These days were not arbitrary—they were an acknowledgment that service comes with sacrifice, and that time to reconnect with family is not a luxury, but a necessity.\n\nI appreciate your encouragement for commanders to evaluate pass structures. However, without standardized family days, the consistency and fairness across the force will likely vanish, replaced by unit-level discretion that may or may not be exercised equitably.\n\nSir, I ask you to reconsider this decision—not just as a policy reversal, but as a commitment to the humanity of our force. We can be mission ready and still prioritize our people. We must.",

    "title": "SMA Grinston's team randomly invited me to join him for his Tour during his visit at Bliss!",
    "text": "I had the pleasure, and huge surprise of being reached out to by SMA(R) Tony Grinstons team about two weeks ago. He's deep into his big tour around the country for AER and the Army's 250th birthday. They asked me to join him for his visit to Bliss. \n\n\nFor those who don't know, Tony Grinston has been strangely intertwined with my career ever since I was a PFC.\n\n\n[I hunted him down and gave him the coveted PFC challenge coin on a dare in 2021.](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/s/YuBvbMy1Ib)\n\n\nSMA_PAO was a huge motivator for me early on in my start for this campaign. \n\n\nWhen I made my first big move by invading AUSA 2023 I continued what has now become a tradition, and gave a freshly retired Tony Grinson the SPC Coin. I was also given SMA_PAOs rank during his promotion ceremony at that same event.\n\n\nI had a long talk with him at AUSA 2024 when he had just really started getting his stride at AER.\n\n\nAnd now this: I'm really never going to escape this man, and he's certainly never going to escape me.\n\n\nIt's weird, our every interaction has been competing for \"the most awkward in my life.\" And I have absolutely no clue why. He is so friendly but since our first meeting was such a taboo extreme commitment to the meme, I feel like I'm stuck in that \"I'm not allowed to be here\" vibe. I'm like half ready to sprint off into the desert before my BDE CSM from 2021 appears around the corner to smoke me.\n\n\nIt's like when you go home for Thanksgiving and see your family for the first time in forever and despite all your growth you revert back to that kid who ate paste and was too shy to answer \"how are you doing?\". \n\n\nBut for this one, we both had a mission. Despite him being subjected to this same kid for the fourth year in a row, he was nothing but friendly and excited about his work and how far I had come. I was yet again eating paste.\n\n\n\nWe teamed up and did a bone marrow registry drive at 2-3FA in support of SGT Bishop. I brought my soldiers to help while explaining absolutely nothing so they could get the bragging rights of meeting THE 16th Sergeant Major of the Army. \n\n\nHe blew me away, despite having a very tight schedule he called all my joes over and talked with them for almost an hour. Gave them tons of advice and shared his experiences when he was first starting out. Then gave them all their first challenge coins.\n\n\nAt the exact same time of that drive at Fort Bragg SSG Bex was doing one of the most successful registry drives I've ever seen. Registering over 1,200 people in one morning. Making me feel more than a bit lame with my contribution that day.\n\n\nWe did some videos and his team was an absolute pleasure to work with. Don't worry. Of course I continued my tradition and gave him the SGT challenge coin.\n\n\n\nAll this to say. AER kind of hit the lottery with getting this man to be their CEO. He is just genuinely ridiculously excited about the job. During our long talk at AUSA 2024, the whole time he was just gushing about how meaningful the job was. He said he loved helping soldiers at the SMA, now it is literally all he does.\n\n\nI don't get any sense of a guy who's punching the clock and playing a character. \n\n\nHe's also making big waves immediately. AER now pays for 100% of travel expenses for emergency trips. It used to be 50%\n\n\nRight now his goal is to get 25% of funding for loans and grants be from small donations from service members. He wants $2.50 from y'all.\n\n\nHis entire tour is based on his own dad-joke line of logic that he was very  \"own dad-joke\" proud of. \n\n\nArmy 250th birthday\n\n\n$2.50 donations from soldiers\n\n\n25.0% of funding from SMs. \n\n\n\n[I think it's cute, here's the link](https://www.armyemergencyrelief.org/donate/)",

    "title": "On Pete Hegseth’s incompetence…",
    "text": "Some folks have dropped in my inbox today suggesting that I repost this. It’s seems relevant to more than a few people. Essentially, the SECDEF is in over his head. \n\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Military/s/AEbQvsIiCy\n\n\nWhat's the deal with Pete Hegseth? Am I the only veteran that recognizes this guy's personality?\n\nCan we have a candid discussion on the type of guy SECDEF Hegseth appears to be? Specifically, I’d like to lead off the conversation around his high bar being mediocrity.\n\n Let’s start with his military career. He was an infantry platoon leader for a time. Then it appears he was tasked at the S-9 (Civil Affairs). Then it appears he volunteered to teach COIN in Kabul. Then IRR. Then ARNG in DC.\n\n Let’s unpack this. He’s an infantry officer. But he didn’t complete Ranger School, Airborne School, or Air Assault School – and he was assigned to the 101^(st). Why not? I spent the vast majority of my time in the Army in the heavy side of things (1AD/1CD/18ABN), and as a medical service officer, I completed both Airborne and Air Assault. I struggled to think of a single infantry officer who I’ve met that hasn’t completed at least one of the three – and I could only think of one.\n\nAny junior officer that’s ever served in a BCT can tell you the #1 captain, if not in command, is the AS3. The lower performing folks are put in charge of made up shops – Civil Affairs being an ‘imaginary’ shop in most battalions. Our battalion’s S-9 was staffed by a never-going-to-get-promoted fat Captain and a SFC with DUI and EO problems. Speaking to former peers, that’s the general consensus – the folks in the ‘made up’ shops are the lowest performers. Why was LT/CPT Hegseth put in that position?\n\nThen it appears that CPT Hegseth volunteered to be an instructor of some sort at the COIN academy in Kabul where he taught one class. Again, these classes are typically taught by post-command Captains/early Majors and Master Sergeants. Why would someone with no real experience in COIN be teaching COIN at a theater level? Why would a Captain be working at theater-level if not to keep him out of trouble or because no one would pick him for their team?\n\nThose are the things we know about. Let’s talk about some things that are missing. His highest level of leadership experience appears to be Platoon Leader. His most impactful job appears to be a battalion-level Civil Affairs OIC/AOIC position. In the civilian world, even FoxNews relegated him to the weekend morning show – the doldrums of TV ratings. He apparently parted ways with the charity(s) with which he was affiliated over some alcohol related incidents – and the charities weren’t terribly impactful either.\n\nAfter reading the signal conversation, it reads like a battalion/brigade battle captain briefing his boss. The granularity of the detail and tick-tock of it make it seem like he’s trying to brief an operational leader – not a group of strategic folks. It’s no wonder there aren’t many people chiming into the conversation – they were likely ignoring it because it just wasn’t being briefed to their level. It’s almost like he was trying to get attention – fishing for compliments on DoD’s actions. I don’t know why, but it just sounds so… junior… so inexperienced.\n\nThis is a guy that reads, on paper, like he aspires to mediocrity. He’s the guy that gets 300 on the PT test, does just enough to get out of writing an OPORD, has his subordinates writing their own NCOERs/OERs, manages to always have rumors of him sleeping around but never gets caught. It’s almost like he’s the guy that likes the idea of being in the military without actually *being* in the military. He’s the guy that volunteers to be rear-D commander, but the decision authority makes him the rear-D XO because he can’t be trusted with responsibility. He's the guy that volunteers to be an infantry officer but doesn't want to do any of the \"hard\" schools.  I feel like I know the personality type, because we’ve all worked with them. I think we all know a Pete Hegseth and none of us would call them \"leadership material.\"\n\nSo what’s the deal? Does no one in DoD at the strategy-level see that this guy is… dangerously meh?\n\nEdit: formatting.\n\nEdit 2:  \nMy inbox asked: what would you expect his career to look like?\n\nFor a 20-year infantry officer in his generation, at bare minimum, I would expect airborne or air assault, and ranger school partnered with a company command.\n\nTo keep him in line with his peers...  \nI would expect battalion and/or brigade S-3/XO/DCO time, a significant assignment on a G/J/C-staff, and battalion command. I would expect some time spent in Vicenza or Bragg and the Pentagon or a MACOM. I would expect CCC and ILE.\n\nTo put him ahead of his peers...  \nI would expect to see some SOC time, multiple successful deployments in UOA in leadership positions, maybe a nominative assignment, White House/Congressional fellowship, or a very deep resume of regiment time.",

    "text": "Went out on a date last night after 2.5 years of not dating and it reminded me why. I met him at the gym, spoke a few times he asked me out to go dancing last night, which was fun but afterwards we got coffee and went to walk to see the lights and I made a comment about having been overseas nearly 6 months last year with my son and spent Christmas in Iceland, which led to him asking me what I did for a living and I panicked and just said I worked from home which he paused walking and looked at me and said “you do onlyfans?” And I was like “where would you get that from!?” He’s like “look at you, what else does it mean? Insurance? HA.” I got all red and embarrassed and said “no I don’t work I live off my Va disability and my late spouses and take care of our son.” And he started to lecture me on not being honest and how does one just not work etc etc and how lucky it must be to just exist and travel without financial stress…I think the worst part of the date was when he asked how my husband died and I made a joke about how I guess not doing the dishes right away can make a guy snap I guess. He didn’t find it remotely funny but I think it’s because he’s a banker and lacks that dark humor bone. Someone here said something about making an app for us DVs to date lol where is it?

    "text": "25 years in this year between active and Reserves. Here goes: \n\nAirman:   \n1. If you have a dogshit supervisor/toxic work space, its not forever. Keep your head low, learn your job to an expert level, and start mapping out future goals. I've read some stuff in here that breaks my heart. I know a lot of you just want to go to work and be left alone, not yelled at by miserable people that poison the workforce. Its not forever, I promise. \n\n2. The world is far more expansive than you think. Some real multiverse shit. I left active and had an interview with the TSA, that they cancelled on after I got my Uhaul to San Diego. I taught high school, then college, was a technical writer, earned 6 degrees, and ended up founding a successful PR firm after reading three books and founding a magazine. The point is, you have WAY more options than you think. Franchises, business ownership, entrepreneurship, grad school, commissioning, special assignments, Reserves, etc. You don't just have to get a corporate dream killing job upon leaving service. Personally, I was way too creative for a cubicle. So I took a very different route. \n\n3. Don't let your worst friends get you caught up. I have seen a LOT of people I served with either go to jail, get kicked out, or get popped for extremely avoidable shit. Don't date people's exes, don't party downtown alone, don't hang out with people you KNOW are on a bad path. You WILL eventually get caught up in their bullshit. \n\nMSgt:   \n1. Younger Airman are better at tech than ever. Tasking them with learning specific programs and workspace apps will yield huge results because of constant change and evolution as the battlespace evolves. \n\n2. Think of the best 5 leaders you ever worked with and write down WHAT made them amazing. Then emulate that person. Learning the difference between a leader and a manager is huge. \n\n3. Set the standard. Your troops wont think much of you if you look like a stuffed sausage in your blues. Be 15 minutes early to work, and always counsel in private, praise loudly and publicly. Help develop your junior troops' success plans for post service and make sure you look for signs of depression/life crisis/pain in the people around you. \n\nNo matter where you all are in your career, I read a lot of your posts and want to remind you: \n\nBE THE CHANGE you want to see in the Air Force. At the end of the day, your life is based on your decisions and mindset so constantly be working on yourself. \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Lets disabuse ourselves of the notion that PT standards decrease disability or medical costs for service members.",
    "text": "With the Air Force (potentially) making changes to PT again, people are already repeating the argument that tougher fitness standards reduce injury and long-term disability, which saves the military money. From my lived experience as a maintainer, and in my new role as a VA disability attorney, I respectfully dissent.\n\nI spent 20 years in aircraft maintenance and now work as a VA disability attorney. In that role, I read entire service treatment records, literally tens of thousands of pages.  I’ve seen firsthand the health effects of military service that have nothing to do with a lack of fitness. Being in shape doesn’t prevent toxic exposure, prolonged shift work, sleep deprivation, or the cumulative toll of manual labor.\n\nAround 2011 I wore a Fitbit because I was curious just how much I was walking every night. I found I averaged 20,000 to 25,000 steps a night. This was on concrete, while wearing steel-toe boots that had thinned soles that the unit had no money to replace. I was working 15-hour shifts, walking 9 to 10 miles a night. \n\nAnd I’m not an outlier. I’ve seen countless veterans with back injuries, chronic joint problems, tinnitus, respiratory issues, and skin damage from years of exposure to chemicals, jet exhaust, and extreme weather. These are the kinds of things that drive VA disability—not poor PT standards.\n\nOne of the biggest problems is that the military has offloaded the burden of fitness onto the personal time of its members, especially in overworked career fields. Most of the people I served with weren’t skipping PT because they were lazy—they were working 12 to 15 hour shifts with no room in the day for structured exercise. They don’t have infinite time. So instead of consistent fitness routines, they either cram a few weeks before their test or hope for the best. That’s where injuries happen. If the military wants to roll out new PT standards without codifying dedicated duty time for members to train safely and consistently, then what we’re really talking about is coercive time theft. Worse, it increases injury risk—and framing it as a way to reduce injuries or lower medical costs just adds insult to injury.\n\nWe can have a conversation about what fitness testing should look like, but we need to stop pretending these tests are about long-term health outcomes or cost savings. That’s not what’s showing up in the records of the people who actually serve.",

Here’s the breakdown I can share right now:\n\nMaintainers: 306 suicides or preventable deaths and 251 from all other causes combined. A maintainer was more likely to die by their own hand than from every other cause combined.\n\nSecurity Forces: 106 suicides or preventable deaths and 86 from all other causes combined. About 54.9 percent of all Security Forces deaths were suicides or preventable.\n\nAll other career fields combined: 514 suicides or preventable deaths in jobs not typically seen as high risk.\n\nOther violent or unnatural deaths: 29 total that could not be attributed to suicide or preventable causes.\n\nIn total, there were 926 suicides or preventable deaths across the Air Force during that period. That means 40.64 percent of all deaths were from suicide or drug overdose. Maintainers alone made up a third of those cases.\n\nThe screenshot I shared earlier is taken directly from the Air Force’s own dataset — not recreated or reformatted. Every line corresponds to a verified active-duty death, with cause-of-death fields transcribed exactly as they appear in the official records. Personally identifying information has been redacted.\n\nThe Intercept will host the full spreadsheet once it clears a final security review from their tech team. I’ll post the link here as soon as it goes live.\n\nIf you have firsthand stories, experiences, or documentation that can help deepen future reporting on this issue, I encourage you to reach out directly or send news tips.

    "text": "For those who may not be familiar, VA Vet Centers provide confidential, community-based counseling and support to Veterans, service members, and their families—at no cost. We help with transitioning to civilian life, managing PTSD, and finding a safe space to heal. There are no service-connected disability requirements and no red tape—just support when and where it’s needed.  Many Vet Center staff, like myself, are Veterans. \n\nBut here’s something that isn’t being widely talked about: The VA/DOGE just eliminated all probationary Program Support Assistant (PSA) positions at Vet Centers nationwide.\n\nPSAs are the backbone of Vet Center operations. They are often the first voice a Veteran heard when they called and the first face they saw when they walked through the door. They handled scheduling, administrative support, and kept things running smoothly so that counselors could focus on serving Veterans. Their work made a real difference in the experience Veterans had when seeking help.\n\nNow, with their positions eliminated, Vet Centers are left scrambling to cover these responsibilities. Counselors and other staff—already stretched thin—must now juggle administrative tasks on top of their clinical work. This directly impacts the quality and accessibility of services for Veterans.\n\nIf you or someone you know relies on a Vet Center, be aware that changes like this can affect the experience. And if you believe cutting essential staff from a crucial Veteran support program is a mistake, let your voice be heard. Contact your representatives, share your concerns, and help advocate for the resources Veterans deserve.\n",

    "text": "Edit:  I'm happy so many commenters have had good supervisors/flight chiefs that give them all flexibility to do these things on duty.  It might seem strange, maybe not, but for a large portion of my career I had supervisors and flight chiefs that did not allow these type of activities.  The only time you got to handle haircuts was off duty or during your lunch hour, and if you were late coming back from lunch you were written up.  Lunch was 1100-1200 and if you were not back at your station working at 1200 you could get a LOC.  This was not at one base/squadron, I have PCS'd 7 times and had around 10+ flight chiefs and even more section and direct supervisors, and the policy for most of my career was \"you do that on your own time\".\n\nSo once again, I'm glad things have changed, and for some of you, have been good for a long time.\n\n\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\\~\n\nAs I inch closer to retirement I realize, you should let your troops get haircuts and drop off uniforms at alterations/dry cleaner during duty hours.  AFIs require grooming and uniforms to be correct, but nothing that I've encountered says these are only off duty activities.  Sure, ops temp and mission requirements might not allow it, but we've all had those days (even in maintenance) where there is a lull in work (even it's only for a few hours).\n\nI was 16-17 years in when my Flight Chief on a random Tuesday said, \"Be back in a bit, grabbing a haircut after the meeting.\"\n\nEver since that moment I went... Wait we can do that?\n\nI let my subordinates know, \"you can get a haircut on company time, just put an appointment in the calendar, and if you take that appointment at the end of the day expect to see a clean haircut tomorrow\".\n\nYour mileage may vary.",

    "title": "The A1C's Email to CSAF",
    "text": "We have to make sure this never dies, so it's good to bring it up every few years. It is part of our heritage. \n\nBackground:  For some years the Air Force had a policy that folks (in career fields that could) were obligated to wear blues each Monday.  This was a policy from CSAF, General Schwartz. \n\nIn 2009 an Airman decided he would rather not wear blues for an upcoming Monday duty, and when told by his chain of command that it was a CSAF policy and an exception would have to come from him,  well, the Airman emailed him.  \n\n  \nHere is the text of the email (name redacted) and the text of the response.  Which the CSAF's O-5 exec sent to the unit commander to pass on to the A1C. \n\n  \nSent: Thursday, April 09, 2009 4:04 PM  \n  \nTo: Schwartz, Norton A Gen AF/CC  \n  \nCc: LT Col 603 AOC  \nSubject: Easter Monday Request  \nGeneral Norton Schwartz,  \nI am an Airman stationed at the 603rd Air and Space Operations Center in Ramstein Germany. Monday April 13th I have a mission qualification board in which I have to give a brief followed by an hour long Q &amp; A session. My request to you is for permission to wear my ABU's in replacement of the standard Monday uniform of the day, the Air Force blues. I personally would feel more comfortable, mentally, weraing my ABU's during this mission ready board rather than the blues uniform. I talked to my DO and he told me that it was not in his power to make such a decision and that I would have to take it up to the Chief of  \nStaff. Thank you for your time sir.  \nv/r  \nXXXXX, A1C\n\n  \nFrom: LT Col AF/CC  \n  \nSent: Thursday, April 09, 2009 11:17PM  \n  \nTo: LT Col 603 AOC  \n  \nSubject: Easter Monday Request Email  \nLT Col,  \nPlease pass the following on to A1C XXXXX. As the Chief's Assistant Executive Officer, I intercepted A1C Snuffy's email to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, but not before he was able to read it. It is true that General Schwartz has an open door (or  \nemail) policy, but with that extended privilege comes discretion and judgment. And good judgment would require such a request as sent by A1C XXXXX first be routed up the chain of command to the appropriate level. This event can hopefully serve to remind A1C XXXXX and his fellow airmen that when we hit the \"send\" button, it goes out to the world. Sometimes we would sit on an email overnight or at least run it by a trusted colleague before sending. And please pass to him that he can rest assured that Airmen across the world will be joining him in wearing blues on Monday as we each deal with the daily challenges of our profession.  \nv/r,  \nLt Col, USAF  \nAsst Executive Officer to the Chief of Staff  \nAir Force Pentagon",

    "text": "As a 67 year old retired E9, I am pretty lucky to be able to use the base gym to try and stay in shape. I don’t advertise retired rank as that’s pretty weird for me. The base I use has a row of lockers just for E9s. I rarely use it but the gym that day was more crowded than usual so I changed in the E9 area. As I’m clearly retired, including having a gray beard, I was getting the stink eye from an AD CMSgt. I looked at him and said everything ok? He said “just do you know, this area is reserved for E9s. I looked at him and said I’m a retired chief figuring that would end it. He said, “let me see your ID, and I think it’s for AD E9s”. I didn’t show it to him and gave him my best screw off look and walked to the shower. I came out and he was gone. Haven’t seen him since but it pissed me off.  Two days later, same gym, the gym was crowded again as I go early and all the people that are now doing the mandatory everyday PT were taking all the lockers. I found one and some young Captain said to his buddy, “this gym would be great if it wasn’t for all the old retired fucks hogging all the equipment and showers” as he glanced at me and one of the other obviously retired guys.  I kinda snapped and said “Relax and just worry about you and pray that someday you can have a career like I did and be my age and still able to work out” .  He looked like he was going to explode but just stormed out. I mean WTF. If I was hogging the equipment as he claimed I’d kinda understand his beef but I wasn’t. Is this going on elsewhere?  I try to go early and miss the AD rush. I would think 8 or 830 am is late enough to not interfere with AD folks working out before work. ",

    "title": "Hanging it up at twenty, but have some stuff for all you youngins out there.",
    "text": "Over the last few years, I have noticed a trend of several folks posting as they retire and passing on a little bit to the current generation.  I am by no means saying that what I have to say will be revolutionary or profound, but maybe you will read this and pick one thing out that speaks to you and know that it came from a place of love from a total stranger. As I begin my Skillbridge, I have likely hung up my NWU’s for the final time already and would like to pass on a few things.\n\n\n\n1. **“The Navy has gone soft.”** \\- Every generation says this bullshit about the next.  Someone in my generation, probably even me, has said this to one of you. A whole lot of people said this bullshit to me and my generation. It goes all the way back to 1775.  Has the military gotten soft? Maybe in some ways, but to generalize it like that is idiotic and you should let anyone know that says that, they are fucking stupid. You will find some Cold War and Gulf War vets talking about how soft we are, yet they could never conceive or handle the hurdles placed in front of us today. When something broke, they reached in and fixed it in an instant. There were no tagouts, WAFs, briefs, and annual NKO’s just to access those systems. The Navy is a completely different place than when I joined in 2005 and to think the same Sailors would flourish in another era is asinine. Think of Jerry West, Magic, Jordan, and LeBron. All were stars of different eras and they cannot be compared. The Navy has not gone soft, we are a product of relative peacetime, poor funding, and exhaustive admin.\n\n\n\n1. **“Should I reenlist?”** \\- A lot of people come to me, having been a twilight tour maverick for the last few years and ask me why they should not reenlist. I tell them that I would never make a choice like that for them, but that they should base their decision off of one thing. Being submariners, I say that they do the coolest job on the best crew of the best boat with the least amount of responsibility they will ever have and that if they do not enjoy it now, it will only get worse. From there, they can decide if they enjoy it enough to do another handful of years or not. Being a first tour Sailor is hard. No one cares what you think. You are doing all this bullshit grunt work. Everything is stupid. These are all things I thought would get better over time, but they actually got worse.  Even as a Chief, some boot JO or moron from the ISIC thought they knew better and me and my guys, who actually own and operate the equipment, had their recommendations and opinions blasted. Even though we were always eventually correct.  The final advice I give to people on reenlisting: make a list of everything you want to get from the Navy. GI bill, VA loan, bachelors degree, etc. Make a hand written list and when you get everything from the Navy, it is time to leave. It does not matter if its 4, 8, 10, 13, 20 or 28 years. The Navy will squeeze you for all you are worth, but make sure you get everything you want from them.\n\n\n\n1. **Suffering is not job performance -** Likely the most toxic trait I have seen in the Navy, and having done both submarine and amphibious communities, its at its worst in the submarine force, is that people believe that making sacrifices, even needlessly, is some measure of devotion to your job. It is not. Losing leave days is not a flex, it means you are not taking care of yourself. Staying up 24+ hours is maybe sometimes necessary, but just doing it and calling it necessary is stupid. The Navy is going to give you plenty of bad deals that you have no choice to take, but a surprising amount of these things can be avoided with some planning and communication. If you make a plan to spread out the bad deal to everyone, its just a normal day at the office. Being burned out will not help you on your next eval and makes you a less effective warrior.\n\n\n\n1. **Live life now -** If you have been in longer than one enlistment, you have seen it. That guy who retires and dies less than four years later. Even my dad, who was not in the navy, worked so hard his whole life and had aspirations of touring North America on his motorcycle and living in a camper all over the South. He died less than two years after retiring and barely took a vacation for himself the previous four decades. Find small ways to enjoy life now, because who knows what will happen. Get outside, take the hikes, book the trips, and travel despite all the BS security manager red tape. It will be worth it. Also, over time, things become more expensive, so you need to travel while you are young so it won't cost you as much later. I love my family and I love my hometown, but if you are traveling there during every leave period, you are fucked up. Funerals, weddings, graduations, and meemaw who cant travel are all reasons to go home, but most of those people can also come to you and visit a place they have never been. You can meet them in a destination as well. It is not always on you to visit them, even if they tell you that. If you mattered to them, they would put out some effort as well.\n\n\n\n1. **Family First -** My advice is really to stay single and kid free as long as you can in the Navy. If you are debt free and dependent free, it makes getting out infinitely easier after you have finished your list of goals. When you have that spouse and kid, you really have a choice: you or them. I have seen so many people who think they have both, but they really do not. If you actually knew what was really happening behind the curtain, those who choose their careers are hurting their families.  My ex spouse and my kid have made so many sacrifices over the years and in some ways their lives will be better for it, but many of those were not necessary. Things I volunteered for and just said were part of the job. In this current Navy, they need you more than you need them, so you are in the best position you will ever be in to put your family first and the Navy just has to take you as is, assuming you show up and do the bare minimum for them. The Navy comes to an end for everyone someday and after its over you will have to deal with the strain you caused your spouse or kids. Minimize it now or risk losing them forever.\n\n\n\n1. **Money -** Most of you are young and now have more disposable income than you have ever seen in your life. I can sit here and talk down to you or I can be realistic.  I will only say one thing that will have a good impact on you and then go be an idiot with the rest for all I care.  Get a modest car, get it paid off as soon as you can, and keep it forever. I had the same Pontiac G6 from when I was a frocked E4 until I was already not being selected for Senior Chief. Over 13 years.  I paid it off in four years, I learned how to meticulously detail it, and YouTube made it so I never had to pay anyone to repair it.  No matter what you think, you do not need a sports car or a brand new truck. Get the car you want, but just get an older and reliable one. A 2013 Silverado is pricy, but not nearly as much as a new or almost new one. With some love, it will still last forever.  The benefit to this is honestly just having more money for other dumb shit. I have not had a car payment since that Pontiac was paid off in 2012 for my own car. I bought another modest car in 2020 with cash and then bought a 2019 Rav4 with all the bells and whistles, but still five years old… with cash. To me, not having a car payment is a bigger flex than driving a Lexus or Mercedes. Back to having more money for dumb shit, its allowed me to have some expensive hobbies: I have a full on sim racing rig with four monitors and a nice gaming computer. I have a nice motorcycle and recently downsized from a fleet of three bikes. I also have a bicycle that is worth about $6-7k. People gave me all kinds of shit for spending that much on a bicycle, but at the same time they were spending 50-75k on a new truck every 2-3 years. My Pontiac and bicycle were 20k, way less than their 50k truck.  You get the idea. \n\nThe other thing that I will say about money is just meticulously watch every dollar that goes in and out. Do not put everything on your spouse and do not just spend it without looking where it goes. If you watch your trends, you may see some alarms go off and fix them. I have more money advice if you want it, but this is enough for now.\n\n\n\n1. **Mental Health -** Everyone has said it. I will only bring it up to emphasize importance. The ship is still getting underway without you. You arent letting anyone down. Get the [help.You](http://help.You) are not less of a man or whatever… if you are not emotionally fit to fight, you are less effective as a Sailor, spouse, and parent. Go to therapy and actually put the work in. if your therapist sucks, get a new one. Thats it.\n\n\n\n1. **Why your Chief sucks -** Like I said earlier, i thought it would get better as i climbed the ranks, but it never did. Why? Being the first tour pee-on is hard. Being the senior petty officer in a situation is also hard. Being in charge is really hard. I am not telling you that your Chief is not a piece of shit, because there are a lot of bad ones out there. At the same time, most are doing their best and deserve a slight bit of grace. There are many things you don’t see. When you forget about your dental appointment, your Chief has to go talk to the XO or whoever and explain why they are a piece of shit because you missed your appointment.  When you dont have time to get a passport, it's often the Chief getting grilled as to why they cant manage their personnel. When you were too lazy to do a tagout the correct way, backstage its the Chief getting blasted for you “almost dying today.” So, for some of you, I think that understanding what they go through may make you hate Chiefs just a little less. You will never get to see the Chiefs massaging a watchbill at 7pm on a Friday the week before deployment to make it so all the new Dads can fly home. You didnt see the Chiefs, in all ratings, staying on the boat during liberty to fix all the sinks and shitters that no one reported as broken until it was randomly brought up and the CO shit a brick. That being said, I have plenty of words for the E-7’s who dont do it the right way. Sadly, they lack enough accountability to know who they are.\n2. **Things I used as a leader that you may consider using -** \n\n\n\n1. **You work for them** \\- Before I ever heard the term “servant leader,” thats what I was. I always told my students as an instructor, my entire command as a 3MC,  and my division as the LCPO… “I work for you.”  It’s true. The first tour kids run the Navy and its my job to arm them with the tools they need and keep them in bounds. I have gotten two of my kids jobs at a company that I havent even started at yet. I had a mental health drop who reaches out to me for help with his resume and as a reference. There are Moms and Dads out there that have essentially entrusted you with their 20 year old and its your job to be what they need. I can remember one time, forward deployed, i was sitting in the Chiefs Mess trying not to helicopter over the kids. I did the midwestern knee slap and said “I am going to go see if my LPO has put me on liberty yet.” One of the other Chiefs immediately said “Oh, you work for a first class?” My reply was that “I work for all of them.” Despite me being the 3.3 Promotable twilight tour chief, a handful of the others in there came to my defense after I left. \n\n\n\n1. **They make the rules** \\- When I reported as the LCPO, I sat down with everyone in my chain of command from the E3 to the Department Head. I asked what we  got wrong and what we got right. More importantly, I asked what are your expectations of me and what should I expect out of you. They would give me some very standard stuff but also you got a sense of what mattered to them. On the same token, we had issues with keeping our watch station, our divisional space, and berthings clean. I told them to come up with a set of rules for those things. Now, for all of the expectations, I am not enforcing anyones rules but theirs.  When I hold liberty or lose my shit about it, I am reminding them that these are rules they made for themselves and that they need to be better about holding each other accountable.  Eventually, there was significant improvement.  We were probably the only division that made their beds and had a spotless berthing to start the day.  When the triad would come through and check cleanliness or stowage for sea, we were on liberty already while other departments were knee jerk reacting to a triad temper tantrum. This also translated to them being better about things like medical and dental, so when the shit list got read off for missed appointments and such, we were almost never on it. \n\n\n\n1. **You cant lead them the same -** The best thing about the Navy is we are all unique with different backgrounds and perspectives.  People also want different things from the Navy. You have to learn your people and what motivates them and how to talk to them. This also means expectations are different. A Sailor may say Chief you let this guy get away with not doing this and ask me to do more. I say that my expectations of your experience and abilities is higher than where that other Sailor currently is. Even at the same paygrade and time in service, unfortunately. You will have the next coming of Jesus sometimes. You will also have some window lickers. Everyone has something to offer and managing your expectations of each accordingly will make for getting more use out of them. My window licker could not write a WAF if his life depended on it, but there were many less cerebral tasks he excelled at. Plan accordingly. Also, some people, regardless of skill do not want to excel at all.  That is okay. I had the Sailor of the Century in my division and it was not because of anything I did. He wanted to do all of those things, but not everyone does. Pushing your average Sailors too hard to be something they do not want to be is bad for them and therefore bad for you. The Navy needs P Sailors too, but my expectation is the bare minimum to not detract from anyone else’s existence. The thing I tell my Sailors is no matter what you think you want to do, always have two plans. One for staying in forever and one for getting out in 90 days. That is all I want from you. What would you do in either plan? If you're getting out in 90 days, you should really think about what you would do and what can you do to prepare for that now. If you are staying in for twenty, what would you do? Usually it is strive to get some qualifications and stuff now so that at your next boat you are simply requalifying quickly rather than for the first time. This can push even someone unmotivated and doing the minimum to go just a bit further.\n\n\n\n1. **Command/Divisional stuff is for working hours -** If they want to organize some get togethers themselves, thats fine, but I never initiated anything that wasnt during working hours. People have lives, especially me, i have shit to do. My division enjoyed wallyball at the gym against other divisions and would also go to lunch periodically. \n\n\n\n1. **The Work Group Chat** \\- I was in like four or five of these fucking things and I hate them. Since you dont get a phone allowance, no one can make you be in it. I tried to have rules for the group chat and tried my best to get them to follow them, but honestly, they were already conditioned to incessant group chats. The rules were \n   1. Work related only, fuck off somewhere else.\n   2. If its not meaningful to tomorrow morning, it can wait til quarters.\n   3. Turn off notifications for the chat and check it before bed and when you wake up. LPO or I will call if its that time critical.\n   4. Answer my phone calls, because if I call, its that critical.\n\n\n\n1. **Never at your own UIC** \\- Okay, so when I was in my post divorce hoe phase, there probably wasnt a rank that I missed. So, hit me with that Chief stereotype if you want. I avoided all the headache and drama by having one rule: Never at my own UIC.\n\n\n\n1. **“If you are going to be a sea lawyer, you gotta go to law school”** \\- It should go without saying, but you cant enforce shit if you dont know the rules. You also probably look like shit if you dont know the rules. Be better than everyone else, know the instructions and not just the ones you care about.\n\n\n\n1. **Does it matter?** \\- There is too much to handle this day and age.  We are undermanned and overtasked. You wont get everything and if you do you will hate life and your division will too. When times are tough, you need to look at the situation as a whole and pick the shit that doesnt matter and just punt it. Life isnt going to be perfect. Your CSMP will never be empty and a few check notes and PMS alerts arent the end of the world. A few hours on the beach may be what your kids need to just survive until tomorrow. They usually will reward you back in the end and make it up to you. Youll take the ass chewing for it, but you are the Chief and thats your job. Besides, what are they going to do? Fire you? Let them. Tell them youll be sure to give a good turnover to whoever they find to replace you or type it out if they plan on gapping the billet for a while. You are the umbrella of protection from the storms of department chiefs and officers who want to look good to their higher ups.\n\n\n\n1. **You don’t know everything and thats okay.** \\- That is pretty much it. Find out who knows so you can ask. I had a student buried in bankruptcy proceedings and somehow I became an amateur attorney. I wasnt before, but i learned quickly!\n\n\n\nIf you made it this far, thats nice of you and you didnt have to do that.  I hope that you become the person and the leader you never had or emulate the good ones you saw, inside or outside of the Navy. \n\n  \nReddit fam is always authorized to reach out if they need anything.

    "text": "I wanted to put in words my feelings about where we are and what’s in store. One of my commanders said a few months ago the military are truly the most directly impacted group for any given election. Even though we’re small by numbers compared to the rest of the country, our lives can change every four years. Despite that change, we’re expected to carry out those changes as ordered.  While many feel a range of ways  about the most recent election, leaders know and see that anxiety.   I’ve existed on active duty for 6 presidents, three wars, and across 3 very different career fields.  Know that it’s been a pleasure serving with all of the walks of life in this military regardless of creed, sex, color, or sexual orientation that make up our airmen. The fact that all of those  are included as a testament to the US military‘s ability to embrace and work through differences that much of the rest of the country was not able to accomplish at a range of periods in US history spanning almost a century.\n\nGood leaders will go to bat for their troops, but understand for any given circumstance that they can only go so far. Remember to protect yourself. Make good choices while you serve to better serve you in the long haul.  Know that the Air Force will have its pound of flesh for as long as you’re here. Thus, ensure that whether you have a solid career with retirement or get out early that the people you choose to elect appreciate veteran issues and will go to bat for you when you inevitably leave the service. \n\nTL/DR: I’m old. Protect yourself and your people.  BOHICA. ",

That said, for an organization that’s bleeding talent at an alarming rate and struggling with retention of high performing personnel, it’s incredible how reluctant AFPC is to work with members to accommodate their families. \n\nI just hit my ten year mark two months ago. I’ve done a short tour overseas and I’ve deployed to numerous overseas locations. In total, I’ve spent over two years of my time in the Air Force OCONUS. \n\nI got married two years ago and my spouse is now in his final semester of flight school. My one and only request to the assignments team was to put me stateside. I offered to go anywhere, even the shitty places, cuz he can work anywhere as long as it’s in the US. I had stateside units by name requesting me to go there. I was ready to move to Minot if I had to.\n\nAssignment drops. 3 year accompanied tour in Europe. I call the assignments team and let them know that going overseas puts a hard stop on my spouses career. I beg them to trade with someone else. I remind them that the literal only thing I asked for was CONUS. “We already slapped the table. Your spousal considerations are not compelling to the Air Force. Everyone loves Europe; if you don’t like it, you’re welcome to separate”. \n\nI love my job. I’ve generally loved being in the Air Force. But shit like this makes it so difficult to continue serving. \n\nAnyways, if you made it this far, thanks for listening to my rant. I’ll be pouting at the bar if you need me. \n\nETA: I genuinely appreciate all of the advice. I spoke with AFPC/the assignments team already, and there’s no getting out of this one/no ability to swap. We accepted the assignment and we’re gonna hopefully make it work with his flying requirements. We’re excited for Europe and excited about the unit, just bummed about the career pause. ",

Getting a job in Colorado lined up hopefully. \n\nMan, these last 6 years were a lot of things, but fulfilling doesn't come to mind. Not everyone has a plan when they join, and that's fine. I joined when I was 25 though, and very much did have a plan. I got the AFSC I wanted, which at the time was 3D1x2, cyber transport. Now it's 1D7x1Q (network) or something, and before that, it was an A shread, but now it's a Q shred because of my current unit. If that last sentence was confusing, yeah, reason 2 I am not extending. The Comm career field debacle is just annoying.\n\nReason number 1 of why I'm not extending is the units I've gotten. November 2019 I got stationed at Beale AFB. Word of warning, if you get that place, use your one deny. Base is literally falling apart. You know that saying about being able to tell the quality of a base by how many traffic lights there are? Beale has zero traffic lights. Speaking of the road, 50mph speed limit on the main road and it takes 15 minutes to get from the flighline to the other side of the base. No hospital, no 24/7 food, car required, smallest BX and commissary you've seen, and living 25 minutes away from base was considered very close. But that's not even the main reason I hated Beale.\n\nMy unit there was very unique, we were ground communication technicians for the RQ-4 Global Hawk. I was comm, doing some RF, some satcomm, and some aircraft maintenance things. Never did I do anything in my career field. 24/7 ops with 3 month rotations, toxic leadership, constant high tempo ops, and horrible handling of COVID. Speaking of...\nYeah, they literally told us we weren't allowed to leave our appointment/dorm or have anyone over. I'm not going into that, but let's just say I'm getting 100% disability, and only 20% is physical. The only reason I even PCSed was because the unit shut down after the block 30 GH and below got cut. \n\nI PCSed to a base I'm not disclosing since I'm still here, into a unit where I would go on to sit in a room and continue not doing anything related to my AFSC.\n\nWas my time in the Air Force a miserable experience? Actually, no. I learned a lot, met some friends I will have for the rest of my life, and built myself up into a better person. I feel ready for most of the things life can throw at me, and overall, I didn't hate everything looking back. \n\nSo, here we are at the end. To the people, peace guys, I'll miss you. To the Air Force, thanks for the support, you tried. \n",

    "text": "On my command make a horseshoe or whatever. Fall out. \n\nAlright, I know many of you don't like officers, and there's nothing I can do about that. Officer or not, I'm still a human being. My wife doesn't understand what I'm going through, and I'm too ashamed to go to any of my peers or mentors. I feel completely alone and I'm barely holding it together. \n\nI've been in a little over 7 years. Had one successful-ish company command. Got out of there with a HQ \"oh that's an MQ write-up\" OER. Lies, but whatever. That was my first CPT OER. Took a second command. Was told by my rater that he was recommending me for an MQ. But, (4 months late) I ended up with a center-mass bottom-third rating by my rater and a top-third (but just barely) HQ by my senior rater, with no mention of future command potential. This was a short one. I suspect it was worse than it could have been because my rater and I had a bit of a falling-out near the end of my rating period. That was my second CPT OER.\n\nI'm due one more in this job. Thru date is next month. It'll be another short one, (5 months) and I expect it to be another center-mass rating.  So, my career as an officer is basically over. I'm not competitive for O4 and probably will never be. My PZ look is in 2027, but with no top-block in command I'm a dead man walking. \n\nLook. It's super humbling to admit, but I probably don't deserve to be a major, and I was the world's most okayest commander. Not sure how I fooled my leadership into giving me two commands, but it happened somehow. I think it may be because I'm a serious person, and people mistake that for intelligence. You never think you'll be a statistic, but *someone* has to be profile fodder. That's me.\n\nI always tried to do right by the troops. I actioned their paperwork quickly, made sure they got fed, paid, and trained properly, and treated them like human beings. But am I a transformational leader? No. It turns out I'm more of a \"keep the lights on, accomplish the mission, and don't get anyone killed\" type of leader. I'm not anything special when it comes to tactics, logistics, or technical things. Admitting that is hard. I can't look my wife or kids in the eye. It's my job to take care of them and I'm failing at that, too. My wife thinks I'm the best leader ever because she has no idea what I do, and she doesn't believe me when I try to explain why I'm not.\n\nI hate myself, I am having trouble eating and sleeping, and I feel like I'm gonna throw up at any given moment. Ashamed as I am to look at them, my family is still keeping me here. I couldn't bear to inflict any pain on them, so no worries about me executing a permanent solution to a temporary problem. Truly. \n\nSo, I need a plan. But it's hard to think straight because I'm in such a deep blue funk. So here we are. Any other officers here who were shown the door early? What did you do? Were you able to dust yourself off and make a respectable life for yourself? I've got one more month in command. Then I'll PCS, drop my REFRAD soon after, and...find a job. It's that last part I'm still trying to figure out.\n\nThanks for listening, guys. I'll take an icewater and a spicy McChicken. Fall out.\n\nEdit: Thanks so much for both the kind words and tough love. I really do feel a tiny bit better. Y'all are great. ",

For 5 years, I used to be the high-speed one. The guy who volunteered. The one who believed in the whole “Army Values” speech.\n\nThen I watched the people above me lie first.\n\nThey broke rules, bent policies, laughed about doing the same shit they crucified me for. They admitted it out loud. They joked about it. And when it came time for someone to pay, it wasn’t them. It was me.\n\nI fucked up. I’m not pretending I didn’t. I broke a rule. I made bad choices under stress. Poor judgment, decisions. I own that.\n\nBut what happened after that… it stopped being about “correction” and started feeling like someone decided I was the perfect person to dump everything on.\n\nSuddenly I’m the curfew guy, the problem child, the “shouldn’t have joined” guy, the example in the safety brief.\n\nI lost my stripes. I lost the board that kept being “worked on” but somehow never actually happened. I lost my chance to grieve my own family properly. I lost my chance at a stable home for the person I’m responsible for. I watched everything I was trying to build fall apart while the same people who helped knock it down stood over me asking:\n\n“Where’s your motivation?”\n\n“Grow up.”\n\n“Everyone else has problems.”\n\n“Be an adult.”\n\nI tried to keep going. I picked up extra roles. I stayed late. I took on more than I should have, thinking if I just performed hard enough they’d see I wasn’t what they decided I was.\n\nInstead I ended up standing behind vehicles hearing senior people talk trash about me like I wasn’t there. Words like “useless,” “fat,” “shitbag,” “wouldn’t survive.” Hearing your own chain say that about you hits differently when you were the guy who used to be “high-speed.”\n\nI tried to build a life. Tried to set up a home. Tried to be there for someone who depends on me. Then housing got yanked. Money disappeared. The house deal fell apart. Suddenly I’m basically homeless, trying to pretend everything is fine in uniform while my personal life is on fire.\n\nThe worst part?\n\nWhen I finally broke, when everything snapped and I tried to check out for good, it wasn’t some dramatic moment where anyone rushed in to pull me back. It was quiet. It was ugly. And it confirmed exactly what I’d been feeling:\n\nTo them, I’m not a soldier who slipped. I’m not a human being who got crushed under too much.\n\nI’m just the enemy. The fuck-up. The disappointment.\n\nThey lie. They get away with it. I make one wrong move and my whole life goes off a cliff.\n\nI know I’m not innocent. I know I made my own mistakes in all of this. I’m not asking anyone to call me a hero, or fix my career, or rewrite my story so I look good.\n\nI just want it known that I wasn’t born broken. I wasn’t always like this. A lot of this was done to me. Slowly. Over time. By people who will never see a single consequence.\n\nI’m tired.

So I started saying, “See you around, man,” like we’d all run into each other again, somewhere down the line.\n\nBut the truth is…I never saw most of them again.\n\nWhat started this post is me being bored in my office. Looking at my memoirs and the coins. Wow what a career I had. \n\nI remember looking up one of my closest buddies from basic years later. Found out he retired in 2015. It brought back the last time I saw him, two young privates. So pure. So innocent. \n\n“You went to chow without telling me? Who did you cheat on me with? The black guy from second platoon?” Haha. \n\nAt the airport, full of jokes, nerves, and dreams. We were all so excited about our next duty stations or just getting home. I still remember being jealous of the guys with girlfriends waiting for them or the…what we called the “natty gurls”…going home to their families.\n\n“Final goodbye?” I asked him back then.\n“Maybe,” he said. “If you ever end up at Drum, hit me up.”\n“Yeah, haha. Goodbye bro.”\n\nI didn’t know that would be the last time. He didn’t die; we just… drifted. Life pulled us in different directions, like it always does.\n\nNow I’m at that point in service where most of the people I knew are either out, retired, or gone back to earth. Civilian life. A different rhythm. Final sleep and I sometimes would feel generous and give them coins since they beg for them so much. Those fuckers man; go to work, stop sleeping! I wish I could slap them and tell them CQ tomorrow or something hahaha… fuck. \n\nI think back to those moments, in schools, at airports, at Bliss, at the final Taps, and I wish I could bottle them. Even the ordinary ones. The dumb jokes, the beers, the long waits in uniform. The ever complaining about leaderships. So funny so pure of… life. \n\nPart of me wants to see those friends again. Just to say, “Hey bro, remember me?” But part of me knows… it’s time to let go and move on. I am glad I was a part of their lives; be it ugly or simply beautiful. \n\nWriting this post is a way for me to let it out haha, my wife wouldn’t understand nor my kids. Sometimes writing helps.\n\nStill, if any of y’all out there ever wondered if someone remembers you, I do. \n\nDiet Coke and McChicken please. ",

    "text": "I’m a year into retirement after 20 years in the Navy. The best gift the military gave me was the opportunity to live and work with a true cross-section of America outside of my small hometown. Traveling the world with a diverse and inclusive force set my frame of reference for what this country is, for all its faults and merits. What I see now is the SecWar (is that a thing?) is trying to destroy that for future generations.\n\n# From the transcript ([Source: war.gov](https://www.war.gov/News/Transcripts/Transcript/Article/4318689/secretary-of-war-pete-hegseth-addresses-general-and-flag-officers-at-quantico-v/))\n\n**Universal Clean Shave:**\n\n&gt;*\"If you want a beard, you can join Special Forces. If not, then shave… Telling someone to shave … that's exactly the kind of discrimination we want.\"*\n\nTargets black men. Pseudofolliculitis Barbae (PFB) is a medical condition that affects 45-85% of male African American servicemembers ([Source: Oxford University](https://academic.oup.com/milmed/article/186/1-2/e52/5948064)). I remember when NAVADMIN 071/19 came out, pushing guys to choose between painful laser surgery or getting kicked out. It was described to me as 1,000 rubber bands snapping on the face. The lesions were unsightly.\n\n**Gender Neutral fitness standards:**\n\n&gt;*“Today, at my direction, each service will ensure that every requirement for every combat MOS, for every designated combat arms position returns to the highest male standard only”*\n\nTargets women. The \"highest male standard\" is a Trojan horse for gender-neutral PT standards across the force, which will disproportionately force out women, especially older senior leaders and those returning from maternity leave. In 2016, when the Navy was losing too many experienced sailors, it loosened body fat rules to retain them ([Source: Military Times](https://www.militarytimes.com/news/your-military/2016/03/06/navy-loosens-body-fat-rules-to-retain-sailors/)). If standards get relaxed to keep people in, it can become stricter to boot people out.\n\n**Bad leadership can be excused:**\n\n&gt;“*But you should not pay for earnest mistakes for your entire career. And that's why today, at my direction, we're making changes to the retention of adverse information on personnel records that will allow leaders with forgivable earnest or minor infractions to not be encumbered by those infractions in perpetuity.*”\n\n&gt;*“And that's why today, at my direction, I'm issuing new policies that will overhaul the IG, EO and MEO processes. I call it the no more walking on eggshells policy. We are liberating commanders and NCOs. We are liberating you.”*\n\nEnables shitty leaders. I used to run a first LT division, which essentially became the people dumping ground of the waterfront. About half were women with injuries after giving birth, and the other half were Sailors who were suicidal. A common theme with suicidal people was rape. This “direction” will enable those assholes.\n\n**Sexual Assault:** The DoD's own FY2024 report documented **8,195 reports of sexual assault** ([Source: SAPR.mil](https://www.sapr.mil/reports)).\n\n**Suicide:** The DoD reported **523 service member suicides in 2023** ([Source: war.gov](https://www.war.gov/News/News-Stories/Article/Article/3965617/dod-officials-underscore-long-term-commitment-to-suicide-prevention/)).\n\n**LGBTQ+ Harassment:** LGBTQ+ service members make up only 12% of the force but account for a staggering **43% of all sexual assault victims** ([Source: RAND Corp](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1390-1.html)).\n\n**Redefining \"Toxic\":**\n\n&gt;“The definition of toxic has been turned upside down, and we're correcting that. That's why today, at my direction we're undertaking a full review of the department's definitions of so-called toxic leadership, bullying and hazing, to empower leaders to enforce standards without fear of retribution or second-guessing.”\n\nIf the above doesn't work, not re-enlisting will. The end result is a military of white males who are, at best, \"ok\" with their surroundings.\n\n**TLDR:** As a 20-year Navy vet, I believe Sec. Hegseth's new policies are not about basic military standards, but about whitewashing the military IAW Project 2025.",

Well, I was tall, so I got the pitch from The Old Guard.  My recruiter, a retired SF civilian told me \"never turn down an assignment\" so I ended up at Ft Myer VA.  Within a month, we get a notice that we need to write down all of our equipment sizes, BDU tops/bottoms, boots, etc.  Well, the war gods decided that The Old Guard was going to deploy for the first time since Vietnam.  Everyone in the company was beyond joy.\n\nFast forward...uneventful deployment to the Horn of Africa..done.  I promoted to E5 in 2004 and  I submitted a DA 4187 to transfer to the airborne unit at Ft Richardson AK because they were gearing up to deploy.  The command staff quickly replies \"sorry bud, you have to spend 3 years in The Old Guard before you can transfer out\".  I accepted their decision and went along with my duties.  Well...a couple of weeks later, I get orders to transfer and attend recruiter school!  My mind was literally blown.  I was an NCO volunteering to transfer to a unit that was gearing up to go to war and was denied because I hadn't met the TOG time in assignment, yet was available to transfer to a POG recruiting position???\n\nFortunately, I blew out my rotator cuff and the surgery prevented me from transferring to recruiting.  A year later, I bid the Army a big farewell.  I will never forget the idiocracy that I encountered during my service.  The non-special dudes in the infantry world train to the time instead of the standard.  Way too much hurry up and wait.  There were so many times during garrison, field ops and deployment that decisions and activities didn't make sense, but we just blindly did them.  And, that's sadly why I didn't spend 20 years in the Army.",

I enlisted out of high school, and one thing that made me look at my life, where I was at, and where I was going was seeing new liuetenants commissioning and arriving in my unit. I didn't take college seriously at the time but then I observed how they were around the same age as me but seemingly they were more established as a person with a degree and a competitive yearly salary with benefits (higher BAH as an example).  \n\n  \nMy perspective was limited as I never have been in their position, but this had a big impact on me personally and after that I put way more effort into using my TA to get my degree. I'm over halfway done and getting my bachelors before my ETS has been a goal of mine that I work towards every day. To this day,  I still regret not starting college as soon I arrived to my unit",

    "text": "Commissary officials have taken the first step toward the potential privatization of the military grocery stores, seeking input from the commercial grocery industry on whether they could take over the operation of 178 commissaries across the continental United States, Alaska, Hawaii and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe Defense Commissary Agency released an official Request for Information, or RFI, on sam.gov, the federal government’s contracting site, on Friday. It’s a preliminary step before a Request for Proposals could possibly be issued.\n\n“The purpose of this RFI is to determine whether commercial grocery operators and investment firms are both interested in and capable of assuming commissary operations, with no government subsidy or with a materially reduced subsidy, while preserving the critical military benefit of a 23.7% average savings for authorized patrons,” commissary officials stated in an announcement Friday.\n\nCommissary stores receive more than $1.4 billion annually in taxpayer dollars to cover operational costs, including salaries and other costs, which enables the stores to provide the commissary benefit at a savings to patrons.\n\nThe request is the result of the Defense Department’s April 7 memorandum, which directs all functions that are not inherently governmental to be prioritized for privatization. It specifically cites retail sales and recreation as examples.",

It was a hard conversation for both of us.\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\n**For young soldiers and those still undecided:**  \nMany service members view the military—specifically the Army—as their vocation or chosen career path. However, others serve primarily for the benefits, and some join simply to meet basic human needs. you decide sooner than you think.\n\nIn short, this vocation/career is for some but ***NOT*** everyone. **P*****lease do your time and extract every single ounce of benefit from the military service; BAH, TA, GI BILL, paid global travel, the specialty pays, etc.***  I dropped out of a private university at 19 years old. I decided to be my own man in life. I encourage everyone to be more independent. Go from Private to General. The current CSA was once a private. You can go from lowly private to the General of the Army! However, such takes serious effort and treating this service as a vocation rather than a basic career or just a job.\n\nMy older friend failed to do the hard things while he was younger. No troop schools or functional area. He just went with the flow for years. Started an online MBA but never finished. Had mid-range OERs etc. He was truly average on paper for years. He is still in denial to an extent.\n\nPlease realize your career is a competition as well. If you don't plan to be the best or are the best, please dont expect to be selected or promoted ahead or with your peers.\n\nHowever, we never know what tommorow holds. We could get deployed tomorrow and lose a leg. Use those benefits like TA and GI bill to position yourself and your families during service so they are not close to destitute due to an unexpected injury or QMP. TY\n\nplease take this seriously if you want this to be your vocation/career. if not a careerist extract everything you legally can from the army (TA, benefits, the travel, experience, etc).",

The AGSU isn't perfect, sure, but I also have noticed the Army doesn't really teach new soldiers *how* to wear it, let alone take pride in it. USMC boot camp teaches how to do a military tuck with a Class B shirt, how to tie a Windsor knot in proper and tight way, and also takes the time at CIF to make sure these items are properly fitted.\n\nWhen I went through basic, some raged out CIF civilian threw a bunch of oversized clothes at me that I had to eventually replace on my own dime, and it was completely up to the Drill Sergeants to tell their platoon as little or as much as they personally knew about dressing neatly. Come to think of it, nobody even actually gave instruction on how to wear OCPs.\n\nThe result is that most young soldiers start their careers without knowing how to look sharp, and to the extent some do, there is no UNIFORMITY in how we wear the uniform. Go to an AIT graduation and marvel at all the different angles and fits of the garrison caps, some pants hemmed too short, some completely sagging, the list goes on.\n\nI am NOT saying we should obsess over dress uniforms like the Marines, but if senior leaders could implement just TWO things it would make a huge difference:\n\n\\- Proactively enforce the standard on CIF personnel to issue correct fitting uniforms in accordance with DA Pam 670 and the fitting guide.\n\n\\- Add a standardized and comprehensive (a couple hours) service uniform block of instruction to BCT\n\nThis would honestly go a long way in not making us look so goofy next to our sister services.",

    "text": "I just nutted really hard to Sydney Sweeney and the Lord put this on my heart to say…\n\nFor those of yous about to get out, or recently out (and anyone else out). (Current executive in a large service industry with 5,000 employees. I didn’t finish college and started at the very fucking bottom and worked my way up. So, I know a thing or two and want to help, legitimately). \n\n\nGet yourself some good shirt stays. Pictured above. These cost $11.75 on Amazon Prime with two day delivery. They’re nice, go over the toe and under the sock, so no nasty nut schalpping surprise. Most importantly you look squared away. \n\nAttach those shirt stays to a nice shirt. Wear a nice pair of trousers. Match your belt color to your shoes.   White under shirts, ONLY. I’m telling you, a nice crisp professional look will get you past 95% of applicants these days. You won’t believe the shit I see come into one of my branches for an interview. Anyone in a nice shirt and trousers is going to catch hiring managers’ eyes. \n\nIn fact, go to JC Penny’s, Macy’s or even Men’s Warehouse. Get two to three shirts. (Plain either white or light blue), and two pairs of trousers (one blue l, one black, both tailored). It may cost a little money up front but will pay dividends in the future. Trust me, invest in yourself. \n\nIf you can afford a tailored suit, even better. But, not necessary. I’d rather see you in a well fitted shirt and trousers and a cheap AF and ill-fitting suit. It demonstrates self-awareness and social awareness, too. Ties are great. Don’t get a silk tie for god-sake! You’re not a cheap ass pimp. \n\nMost of the people your age come in looking like shit, like they don’t care, or dressed in street clothes that look like shit but cost their parents’ entire government check for the month. Stand out. \n\nShave. Mother fucking shave. \n\nIf you can’t, clean beard. No one is going to want to hire Ragnar Lothbrok outside of very few employers. \n\nAlmost forgot, don’t wear white socks. Moving on…\n\nTone it down. I’ve seen so many veterans (especially POGs) ramp up the military jargon and “attitude “. Lots of “check”, “tracking”, “roger”, “Oscar Mike”, “send it”, etc., combined with an annoying ass alpha dog military manner. \n\nCivilians don’t know what the hell you’re saying and are weirded out by it. Us veterans, just think you’re gay. And not the good gay.\n\nJust come in with your Sunday School professionalism. Be relaxed. Talk like a human being, and throw in some “Yes, Sir’s” “Yes, Ma’am’s”. \n\nDon’t be cocky. They’ll say they care, but no one cares that you are a Marine, beyond the thought that you’ll work hard and be responsible. \n\nBrush your fangs! Especially you gotdanged smokers and coffee drinkers. Bring some chewing gum too. \n\nAfter your interview, if not offered a job on the spot, follow up. Many hiring managers deal with hundreds of applicants. Drop and email or quick call and thank them for their time. \n\nGet a professional email. Gmail is great. Pussyslayer2002@yahoo.com will get ignored. Just some version of your name @ gmail is good. Proton is another good service. I guess yahoo is okay if you’re a fucking boomer. Hotmail is a no no. Ghetto AF. \n\nOnce you land your job, be appreciative. It may not be your dream job, but stability, hard work and a little something extra will take you a long way and breed prosperity. Job hopping looks bad on a resume. And you tend to have to start at the bottom all over again. \n\nOnce I stopped job hopping I went from $11.71 per hour to over $100k a year salaried with a 20% performance bonus in less than 10 years. You have to grind. \n\nFinally, remember, you’re a Marine. That means you hold the reputation of every Marine past, present and future on your shoulders. Act like it.\n\nSupplemental:\n\nGet a mentor in the civilian world. \n\nAsk vets who are out and successful about their journey. Emulate them. \n\nIf at all possible, LEARN TO WRITE. I took a technical and creative writing course and it served me exceptionally well. \n\nLearn smartsheet, excel, word, google sheets, etc. \nHave someone review your resume. \n\nAnd if anyone here needs any of that help, feel free to DM me. I’m happy to help any young Marine in any way I can. I’ve made a ton of mistakes and have things to teach about what not to do.\n\nSF \n\nThere are some errors above. I can’t fix cause my phone won’t let me move the cursor back up. Just ask… ",

    "text": "Active duty servicemembers who think their military pay is lousy tend to have one thing in common: **they have never held a full-time civilian job.** Very few jobs in the civilian world can match Uncle Sam when it comes to perks and benefits, such as Tricare and retirement. In the military, it’s often what you *don’t* pay for that makes you money.\n\nAs a former active duty officer, current ANG officer, *and* a GS civilian, I have some insight on this matter.\n\nOn the military side, I’m an O3 with nine years of service. If I were on active duty, my gross pay would be **$120,922**. After taxes and deductions, it comes down to about **$103,619** (at least per the app I’m using.)\n\n\n\nNow, let’s look at the civilian side:\n\nMy salary as a GS13 civilian is **$114,012.00.** So, not that big of a difference, right? \n\nGuess again.\n\nHealth insurance? $9,663.63\n\nDental insurance? $1,659.62\n\nFederal retirement contribution? $5,013.26\n\n\n\nAfter these deductions and taxes, my take-home pay is a paltry **$76,095.20**…just *two-thirds* of my gross pay! Furthermore, although we have “good” health insurance, not everything is covered. We *still* make co-pays.\n\nBut, of course, I also have drill pay from the Air National Guard. If I drill every month and do 15 AT days during the year, then I’m looking at grossing **$19,500.89**, of which I take home **$15,319.89**. Combining these two streams of income, I’m netting **$91,415.09** annually…*still* less than I’d be making on active duty!\n\nOf course, you don’t have to go into federal employment when you separate: private companies can pay great salaries. When I first separated in 2016, I accepted a hoity-toity corporate job at a healthcare conglomerate in Oakland. Adjusted for inflation, I had a starting salary of $152,300. Yes, it’s an expensive area, but it was more than manageable for a (at the time) single guy. But, alas, after just a few months of working there, management decided my position was no longer needed, and I was laid off. That’s another thing to keep in mind: in the private sector, they can lay you off at any time for any reason. *You have no job security.*\n\nOf course, your income is just one factor when it comes to overall well-being and quality of life. With this current set-up, I have a much better work/life balance than I would have on active duty. Everyone's circumstances are different and you have to take many externalities into account. But, I hope this rant helps you weigh your options as you consider separation.\n\n",

    "title": "‘Boggles the mind’: US defense department slashes research on emerging threats",
    "text": "Terminated projects include studies on the implications of AI in combat and how extremism spreads online.\n\nWhat are the implications of allowing artificial intelligence (AI) to make critical decisions about life and death in combat? That’s a question that Nicholas Evans, a social scientist at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, was hoping his research could answer — until funding for his grants was cut by the United States Department of Defense (DoD) this month.\n\nThe grants were among 91 social-science studies terminated by the DoD, including many that were part of the flagship Minerva Research Initiative, which supports basic social-science research so as to better understand emerging threats to national security.\n\n“One of the brilliant parts” of Minerva is that it takes “the notion of security broadly,” says Leonardo Villalón, a political scientist who studies the Sahel region in Africa at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Minerva grants fund research on global dynamics such as violence, instability, natural catastrophes, human displacement and migration, he says.\n\nThe defense department stated in a press release that it was “scrapping its social science research portfolio as part of a broader effort to ensure fiscal responsibility and prioritize mission-critical activities”. Termination notices, seen by *Nature*, state that the grants no longer served DoD’s “program goals or agency priorities”.\n\n“The big challenge”, says Evans, “is that there is almost nowhere else in the United States where you can get two and a half million dollars to do social-sciences research, and that limits our ability to get funded.” He and his collaborators received US$5.3 million in research grants in 2021 and 2024, as part of Minerva. With the funding cut, he will lose US$4.3 million.\n\n# National interest\n\nThe Minerva initiative was launched in 2008, and grants are managed by research offices run by the army, air force and navy. A portion of the funds go towards educating students at US military schools and academies in key areas of the social sciences, and many of those grants have also been terminated.\n\nNeil Johnson, a physicist at George Washington University in Washington DC, received termination notices for two grants, each worth about $2.5 million. One of them, close to the end of its five-year term, supported research on how threats, hate and extremism spread through online and offline social networks. The other focused on security threats along national borders.\n\n“The rationale was really weird,” says Johnson. For years, he has participated in calls and briefs at DoD agencies. Among other things, he has advised intelligence officers at military bases of his research findings, from the weaponization of health to gun violence. Now that all stops, he says.\n\nSpending money on military preparedness — on armaments and technology, for example — but not on understanding the nature and causes of potential military conflicts is incredibly short-sighted, says Kathy Baylis, a development economist at the University of California, Santa Barbara. “It kind of boggles the mind,” she says. The Minerva Research Initiative accounts for a fraction of the DoD’s budget. In its 2024 budget request, the department requested $64.3 million for Minerva out of a total budget of $842 billion.\n\nBaylis has also had her Minerva grant terminated. Awarded in 2023, it enabled her to study the effects of climate shocks on food security in sub-Saharan Africa. It was initially guaranteed for three years, with an option of two more. Between the Minerva losses and cuts to grants from the US Agency for International Development, Baylis has lost roughly US$5 million over the past few weeks. Since then, she has been scrounging for money to pay salaries and working out ways to share the limited data that she and her team managed to collect. “They just wasted a whole pile of money that had been spent on research that can no longer be fulfilled,” she says.\n\nVillalón, who was studying the impact of climate hazards on societies in the Sahel, and how those communities were responding to changes, had already spent most of the $1.6 million awarded as a three-year grant in 2022. He and his team had only about $200,000 left over, which would have been used to support data analysis and publication.\n\n# What next?\n\nMany researchers are looking for alternative sources of funding, and some are discussing legal recourse with their universities.\n\nEthan Addicott, an economist at the University of Exeter, UK, whose terminated grant was supporting research on geopolitical tensions that could arise from warming oceans and movement of fish stocks, says students and postdocs recruited for these projects are in danger of losing their jobs as a result of the cut.\n\nThe terminations could also mean that researchers will seek funding from other nations that don’t necessarily have the same national interests as the United States, Addicott says.",

But the Senate has voted, and you are now the leader of the most powerful military on the planet.\n\nRather than offer you empty congratulations, I hope you will accept—in the spirit of the love of country that I know we both share—some unsolicited advice. You face unique challenges: You are among the least qualified major Cabinet nominees in modern American history, you have no background in leading a large organization, and you come into office with serious questions about your character and fitness, even from some in your own party. I must tell you that I believe you should have told Donald Trump last fall that you could not, in good conscience, accept his offer.\n\nBut you did accept it, and so I write to you today not as a critic, but as a fellow American. I know—as you do—that your success is essential to the security and safety of our nation, and so all of us with something to offer owe you our best efforts, including our direct and honest views.\n\nI send these thoughts to you without partisanship or ill will: The time for that is over. We live in dangerous times and you cannot fail in your new duties. I have no interest in lecturing you about your personal life, or your reported use of alcohol. I have been through such struggles myself, and I believe that even—perhaps especially—in challenging moments, you will choose to approach your new responsibilities with both physical and intellectual sobriety.\n\nI worked in national security and defense affairs for nearly 40 years, including a quarter-century in which my responsibility was to educate American officers. I do not know how to be a Secretary of Defense, but based on my experience, I have three recommendations for you that I hope will contribute to a successful tenure leading America’s military.\n\nFirst, and most important, I implore you to listen to the men and women working for you who have served our nation. Listening is a sign of strength, Mr. Secretary, not weakness. Every bad senior leader I ever encountered in my career, including generals, admirals, and elected officials, all had the same flaw: Insecurity. They talked and opined and issued orders instead of listening. (From your own military days, you probably remember this expression: *They only had Transmit Mode, no Receive Mode.*) I know you’ve been charged with shaking up the Pentagon, but the dangerous world around us will not put their plans on pause if you get distracted by a superficial domestic culture war.\n\nYou will have the power of decision on almost anything that crosses your path, but you are not omniscient. You are surrounded by a wealth of experience and expertise. Yes, some of the people under you will not be happy about the election or your confirmation, but they respect the terrible burden you’re carrying, and they are there to help you. They share your love of country, and your sense of duty. Their success is your success. They are not the enemy. Hear them out.\n\nSpeaking of enemies, you must contend with the reality that you are entering office with almost no credibility with your opposite numbers in Moscow and Beijing (and elsewhere). I say this not as an insult, but to describe in plain terms the conditions you face abroad. I have long experience with the Russians, in particular, and while they will treat you with formal courtesy, make no mistake: These are hard and dangerous people who will have no respect for a former O-5 and talk-show host. I realize it is an uncomfortable truth, but defensiveness about this will only distract you from the work ahead.\n\nYou must cover a lot of distance with those opponents. Your previous skills as a public commentator will be of no help and in fact will prove counterproductive in such situations. You cannot bully and speechify your way to respect with such people; they are tough in a way that cannot be countered with macho posturing or rants about DEI. The facile charm that worked for you in public life will be a vulnerability in dealing with our enemies, who will seek to exploit every thoughtless word. The combative punditry that works so well on cable television in America might have helped you burn time during your confirmation hearing, but none of that will serve you well in negotiations or discussions with our dedicated foes. (It won’t do you much good talking to our allies, either.)\n\nInstead, you will find that you must rely on people who have been in the rooms you’ve never seen until now. You are not required to take their advice, Mr. Secretary, but when your counterparts call you, your staff will be able to assist you in ways you might not have considered. They can warn you about your opponent’s strategies—and weaknesses—before you even pick up the phone. Your previous career has rewarded bombast and bluster; now you will have to master judiciousness, restraint, and the strategic use of silence.\n\nFinally, I hope that you will leave behind the kind of rhetoric that brought you to prominence. I know that you gained this post by being a loyal soldier for President Trump. The truth is that most Americans—including the Americans who serve in the U.S. military—don’t really care nearly as much as you’d think about the cultural issues that brought you into the Trump administration. You are no longer a pundit or a provocateur: From today, your fellow citizens are trusting you with the lives of their children. (“Thank you for giving us your son,” a general told one of my friends whose boy, like you, went through ROTC. “We’ll take good care of him.”)\n\nThe rest of us are trusting you with all our lives. You could well be the last person to speak to the president before he decides to go to war—or considers using nuclear weapons. Partisan attachments will be meaningless at such moments.\n\nWhen I was barely 30 years old, I advised a Republican senator who was trying to decide whether to support President George H. W. Bush’s 1990 decision to go to war against Iraq in Kuwait. “Am I doing the right thing?” he asked me. At that moment, I felt as if the world had fallen on my shoulders. Nothing else mattered. “Yes, I think so,” I stammered. And then we spent hours in the gloom of a winter afternoon discussing his eventual vote to send young Americans into battle.\n\nYou will face decisions galactically greater than my one small moment with my boss 35 years ago. Some decisions you make will feel small to you, but they will have an impact on hundreds of thousands of people in the military community, and others will live with them long after you’ve left government service. More importantly, some of your answers may have existential consequences for humanity itself. The election and the speeches are over. The lives of millions—or perhaps billions—now depend on things you say that no one but the president might hear.\n\nYou are a man of faith, Mr. Secretary. We have that in common. And so I’ll close with my sincere wish that the Lord keep you and guide you in the days to come.",

America’s youth is not fit.\n2. America’s youth will likely continue to be less fit.\n3. America’s military must be manned; this is a no-fail mission.\n\n\n\nThis is not rocket surgery here.\n\nAmerica is changing.  Military leaders – you with all your Professional Military Education and your self-labeled “strategic visionary” LinkedIn by-lines – news flash: you have to change with America, you (and your legions of [non-vol’d recruiters](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Emilitary%2Ecom%2Fdaily-news%2F2023%2F11%2F01%2Farmy-suddenly-and-chaotically-told-hundreds-of-soldiers-they-have-be-recruiters-immediately%2Ehtml&amp;urlhash=ROx3&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)) can’t just impose your will on the nation’s youth (unlike the already-recruited youth you can and do impose your wills on).  In other words, stop fighting the scenario!\n\nThis is not unchartered territory here.\n\nWhen I entered the Air Force to be a pilot, no one asked me how well I could fly a plane.  When Army soldiers enlist, no one asks how well they can shoot a rifle.  Why?  Because the military trains their people to do those things.  So, if I can go from showing up off the street to flying an F-16, is it too much of a leap to expect our military to be able to train our recruits on how to exercise and have a healthy lifestyle?  With that being said, is it really that much of a calamity to have to lower standards for enlisting (insert indignant gasp here)? Despite its shortcomings, the U.S. military’s tactical prowess remains the best in the world, and this is because its training is the best in the world.  We can teach kids who have never flown to be single-seat 5th-Gen fighter pilots; surely, we can teach them how to do a push-up.\n\nAnd while we are on lowering standards…\n\nUpon entering the U.S. Air Force Academy in 1995, the eyesight requirements for me to become a pilot were incredibly strict.  You basically had to be able to see through walls to be “PQ” (pilot qualified).  Fast forward a mere 3 years and a major pilot shortage later and the Academy’s Commandant was nearly ordering people to go to pilot training with all sorts of waivers and relaxed standards being tossed out like candy.  And despite all those concessions, guess what happened?  People went to pilot training and excelled, as they had been all those years before – no jets falling out of the sky, or post-Lasik eyeballs exploding, or any other manifestations from the gloom and doom predictions from the nay-sayers.  So, this talk about adjusting standards to ensure a steady supply of recruits is nothing earth-shattering…we just need to do it…again.\n\n“We are suffering from a healthy economy”\n\nI love that line.  And it is here we get to the supply and demand discussion as it pertains to the military as a career.  In this case, military jobs are what is being supplied.  As for the demand, well, it’s headed down the toilet.  So, let’s say you are one of those out-of-shape Gen Z’ers and you’re considering what you want to do for a living, at least for the next few years.  In your eyes, the military is offering you the ‘privilege’ of perhaps going to war and being killed and/or maimed and/or traumatized.  Further, the military is ‘enticing’ you to forfeit some of your rights as an American while it tries to, and does, infringe on other rights you should have. Whether or not you go to war while in the service, you’re statistically more likely to be [raped or assaulted](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eprotectourdefenders%2Ecom%2Ffactsheet%2F&amp;urlhash=LgSI&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) if you are a woman.  And if you do enter into the service, over 17 of you will, during or after your career, [kill yourself each day](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ementalhealth%2Eva%2Egov%2Fdocs%2Fdata-sheets%2F2023%2F2023-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-508%2Epdf&amp;urlhash=s8PR&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block).  And with all that, what is the military’s ‘sales pitch’ to you: “You need to run faster in order to be considered worthy!”  Is it any wonder why so many kids give the military the middle finger!?  Succinctly put: the military is not creating any demand for their products (jobs). Far from it, in fact.\n\nIf they wanted to get in shape for the military, wouldn’t they?\n\nBut here’s the thing – if Gen Z wanted to work for you, wouldn’t they do what you asked?  I know I don’t think like an 18-year-old (well, mostly), but if someone told me that I had to run around a track 6 times to get the job I wanted, I’d have my ass at the track…and I don’t like running.  But kids aren’t doing that.  Why?  Not because standards are too tough or too high, it’s because they don’t want any part of our once-heralded profession of arms.  I chuckled the other day when I read that the Navy put out a pamphlet on how kids who have not yet enlisted can prepare for passing their PT test.  Cool product, Seamen.  Problem is – it’s not that they don’t want to run, it’s that they don’t want to join.  (I do feel sorry, however, for that sap O-4 staffer that missed his kid’s recital because he had to stay late to put that pamphlet together…I’m sure some O-8 took the credit, though.)\n\nMy friend “Deuce” used to tell me to think of things in extremes to help frame an issue.  So, here’s an extreme: if the military paid an E-1 $10,000,000 (that’s 10 million dollars) a year, how many fat Gen Z’ers would get into shape?  Is it unrealistic to think that many would?  And although that salary is absurd, it serves to convey this point: there is an extrinsic value that everyone places on most everything and entering the military is most definitely included in that calculus.  So, in all this discussion about recruiting woes and fitness and whatnot, how many times have we heard a military senior leader go to the Hill and lobby for higher wages for enlistees?  (And I’m not talking about [piddly-shit raises](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwalkthetalkfoundation%2Eorg%2Fpriorities-priorities-general-flag-officer-promotion-vs-competitive-pay%2F&amp;urlhash=wN2v&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) that can’t even keep pace with inflation, I mean like [actual](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebarrons%2Ecom%2Farticles%2Fpilots-american-airlines-delta-united-pay-3d0f7ba5&amp;urlhash=gRzF&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) [raises](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Ebarrons%2Ecom%2Farticles%2Fpilots-american-airlines-delta-united-pay-3d0f7ba5&amp;urlhash=gRzF&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block).)\n\nCrickets.  \n\nI briefly worked for [Air Force General Mark Kelly](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eaf%2Emil%2FAbout-Us%2FBiographies%2FDisplay%2FArticle%2F108818%2Fmark-d-kelly%2F&amp;urlhash=k4IL&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) who would say something to the effect of ‘we’ve relied solely on the patriotism of our military members for far too long.’  Poignant, no?\n\nA(nother) ‘Hearts and Minds’ defeat.\n\nLet’s not mince words here – the recruiting crisis is a conflict that our military is waging…and losing.  It is the easiest conflict we can and will ever fight for we have all the intel at our fingertips.  There is no fog of war, there is no unpredictable adversary…and yet, we are still pretty much getting our asses kicked.  But I don’t accept, and I hope you don’t either, our military’s sulk-in-the-corner response: quibbling about fat kids, or the economy, or BRAC (all the while yammering about how they [aren’t getting promoted fast enough](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Earmytimes%2Ecom%2Fnews%2Fyour-army%2F2023%2F11%2F14%2Farmy-secretary-fears-mid-career-officer-exodus-amid-promotion-holds%2F&amp;urlhash=sWEQ&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block)).  This war doesn’t require a [McChrystal-like spaghetti chart](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Enytimes%2Ecom%2F2010%2F04%2F27%2Fworld%2F27powerpoint%2Ehtml&amp;urlhash=i8hV&amp;trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) to grasp – it’s pretty straightforward and here is the solution to it all:\n\n\n\n1.

    "title": "Divorce after retirement. Spouse couldn't adjust.",
    "text": "I retired less than a year ago and I'm getting divorced. My spouse couldn't adjust to me not being active duty anymore. \n\nI had a difficult career while I was in. I drank way too much, I smoked, I was extremely depressed and had suicidal thoughts more than I actually admit out loud. I tried medication and therapy while I was active but they didn't really do much for me then. I was miserable but she was happy. Her and the kids were always taken care of even if I wasn't the best husband and dad in the world.\n\nSince retirement though I've seen a lot of personal growth/improvement. I don't drink any more at all, I quit smoking and the meds and therapy seem to be working. Depression has lessened and no more suicidal thoughts. I picked up gardening and decorative painting as hobbies. I am way more engaged with my kids and I began taking my dogs out more and just things that normal people do. \n\nWhen I started getting better is when things started getting worse. She started demanding more. No matter how hard I worked at being a better person, no matter how much of a better person I became, it was never enough. I asked her to see her own therapist and she refused. She was steadfast that I was the problem and had all the problems. \n\nI managed to convince her to go to marriage counseling because maybe a third party could help me understand what she was trying to communicate. After a initial session we agreed that the counselor was a good fit for us. At that point I also authorized the marriage counselor to talk to my therapist so I could really tackle the problems she thought I had head on.\n\nTurns out that the marriage counselor and my therapist agreed that I was doing really well. Making great progress from who I was to who I am now. The counselor even told her that in session. Counselor suggested that she focus on herself with her own therapy.\n\nI don't think she was expecting to hear that because she really went off the deep end. She started stealing and abusing prescription pills, drained the bank account became verbally abusive to me and started to try to manipulate the kids against me. She then became physically violent to where police were called and she was arrested. \n\nThe marriage counselor, my therapist and my psychiatrist know the story and seem to agree  that my personal improvement after retirement somehow left her feeling some type of way about herself that she couldn't reconcile on her own. They've suggested that she needed me to be the one with the problems so she could feel better about herself, and once she felt exposed she lashed out.\n\nLike the title says, I'm divorcing her now. I'm curious if anybody else has a similar story.\n\nTL:DR Spouse didn't like the person I became after retirement. Getting divorced. Anyone else?\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "My grandfather was an avid autograph collector, and I’ve been sorting through some of what he left behind. Some signatures are from household names, others more obscure, but as a Navy vet myself, it’s been fascinating to see his interest in the military and aviation before he ended up serving in WWII.\n\nNot sure exactly when Sims wrote this note, but he died in 1936, so my grandfather would’ve been quite young.\n\nI don’t know how many folks here are into the historical side of things, but I figured some of you might appreciate this, both for the autograph and the classic Navy-style tone he used to scold a kid.\n\n\n\nFor those unfamiliar, here’s a quick AI-assisted rundown on Sims:\n\n**Admiral William Sowden Sims (1858–1936)** was a pivotal figure in U.S. naval history, best known for revolutionizing naval gunnery, modernizing fleet tactics, and commanding U.S. naval forces in Europe during WWI. He challenged outdated practices early in his career and even bypassed his chain of command to write directly to President Theodore Roosevelt about Navy inefficiencies (which actually earned him a promotion).\n\nDuring WWI, Sims worked closely with Allied navies and played a key role in countering the German U-boat threat. He later served as President of the Naval War College, where he helped shape modern naval doctrine. Sims was respected—and sometimes resented—for his bluntness, intellect, and willingness to challenge the status quo.",

I had a family in my last shore tour, and they are my life. I deployed multiple times when I was younger. Now, this shit hurts every day. I dread heading to work every day. I dread doing the work. I dread having to go out to sea. I miss my family daily and struggle with focusing at work over how much I hate this shit. Duty every few days takes me away from them, the people don't really give a shit, the triad are all about advancing their careers. Everything about this job is fucking trash, and I see civilians come aboard and help work on my stuff that do a fraction of what I do but get paid two times or more than I do WITHOUT the Navy stuff in between. How the hell do you guys continue to perform at such a high level and not get burnt out because I am so tired of all this stuff and I am stuck until the very end.",

He had wild stories about flying men and material around the far east. Hong Kong, Japan, Thailand, Vietnam.   He went everywhere, and had a great time doing it. \n\nHe wanted to make a career of it, but he had a very bad off duty motorcycle accident.

    "text": "Military lawyers warned that President Donald Trump’s strikes on alleged drug-smuggling boats were potentially illegal, but their opinions were ignored or sidelined, according to a new report.\n\nTrump announced this month that the U.S. military had destroyed three different boats that were allegedly crewed by members of the Tren de Aragua gang smuggling drugs to the U.S. from Venezuela.\n\nThe president shared footage of two of the strikes—which killed a total of 14 people—on social media, and mentioned a third boat in passing while speaking to reporters outside the White House.\n\nOfficials have refused to answer questions about where the strikes took place and under what circumstances, and have not provided evidence that the boats were carrying drugs, The Washington Post reported.\n\nThey also have not provided a legal authority that would justify the summary execution of civilians.\n\nBut within the Pentagon, some career defense officials and military lawyers have provided verbal and written opinions to the Department of Defense leadership, saying they were concerned about the legality of the strikes, the Wall Street Journal reported.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard often intercepts suspected drug smugglers, but the standard rules of procedure for dealing with cartel members are to arrest and prosecute them, not execute them.\n\n**The officials identified problems with the legal justifications for the strikes, and they warned that the soldiers who conducted the attacks could be held personally liable for the killings, sources told the Journal.\nBut the officials believe that decision-makers at the Department of Defense sidelined them and ignored their concerns, a source told the paper. Other officials are looking for ways to provide legal protection for the individual military personnel involved in the strikes.**\n\nIn a statement to the Journal, White House spokeswoman Anna Kelly said the trikes were “fully consistent with the law of armed conflict,” even though the U.S. is not at war with Venezuela.\n\n“These presidentially directed strikes were conducted against the operations of a designated terrorist organization and were taken in defense of vital U.S. national interests and in the collective self-defense of other nations who have long suffered due to the narcotics trafficking and violent cartel activities of such organizations,” she said.\n\nChief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell also denied to the Journal that any Pentagon lawyers with knowledge of the strikes had raised concerns about their legality and said the administration was on “firm legal ground.”\n",

Money can be tight for the family even if she works two jobs to supplement the husband's income. So how do so many of these women just sit around all day and eat fast food while the husband's at work?\n\nThis happens even in the HCOL states that I've visited: Hawaii and Colorado. These also happen to be the most outdoorsy states with the lowest obesity rates, and I've seen many a dependapotamus hanging around the food courts.

    "title": "Why do Navy Gyms suck so bad?",
    "text": "Recently PCS’d to Norfolk. Was exited to finally have “free” gyms to go to. I was sorely mistaken… None of the gyms have proper ventilation or even air conditioning, the locker rooms are absolutely disgusting, and the equipment is gross. The fleet fitness center, McCormick hall, and N-24 all have broken ACs. They look like shit, but god forbid you don’t show your CAC to the person scrolling TikTok at the desk and press the iPad check-in. I literally just flashed a credit card one day just for the hell of it… Want to shower off now that you’ve sweated the equivalent water weight of a toddler? Then go to the man made horror beyond your comprehension that is the shower stalls. By the way the hot water doesn’t work, but don’t worry, we put up a hard card laminated note telling you that a ticket has in facts been submitted for a year. Plus it’s 90 degrees inside, so why would you need hot water to begin with? Same for the pool of rancid piss that’s been sitting in the broken urinal for the last 3 weeks. The gym parking lot fleet side is basically just extra parking for the piers/NEX, so you have to park and walk a literal quarter mile to access the building. My 30 minute workout literally takes 1.5 hours of effort and planning to complete. \n\nThe main gym by gate 2&amp;4 was built in 1909, literally at the time where guys in funny mustaches lifted comically bulbous barbells in leotards. The paint is chipping off in all of the basketball courts, which could be properly fixed by a single deck division from any ship in a work week. The equipment at the fleet gym is good, but it’s hotter than Satan’s asshole and the showers are a living bioweapon. \n\nI love the navy, but the one thing that has always chapped my ass in my career is the fact that they always bitch about sailor fitness, but do absolutely nothing to support it. There is no command PT, no time cut out for fitness per day. Any nutrition, training, or dietary services that I’ve ever referred my sailors to are always 3 month wait times because dependents take up most of the weekday slots and have time to do so. Shipboard nutrition is rough. The only time they care about your fitness is apparently during PRT or Chief season, at which point they’re either signing waivers like they’re going out of style or fudging BCAs.\n\nThis is part bitching, but also frustration. My state college had a gym that was leaps and bounds better than we have today and that was 12 years ago. Sailors are motivated when inspired. Give them the tools to succeed and they’ll rise to the task. Just build new gyms to replace the hellholes currently offered. It’s not that hard.\n\n",

    "text": "There was a post earlier that made me think of this guy. It was 2011/2012, and Spice just became a thing in the Navy. I am a relatively new officer, but I was a prior enlisted FMF Corpsman before, so not new to the Navy.\n\nIAs are in full swing around this time. We had a sailor on our ship get sent back from an IA early due to behavior issues. Our CO then gets picky about who he sends on IAs and makes me \"interview\" people because I have deployed to both Iraq and Afghanistan x2 (1 was an IA). The idea was I could let them know what they are getting into, which in reality, you could end up doing anything on an IA. I saw some random sailors conducting supply convoys in country, I met a random IT3 pull into our Combat Outpost who was gunning a 240 in a dangerous area of Afghanistan, I ran into a GM back in 2005 at Camp Blue Diamond Iraq who was working with Marine Ammo Techs, met a guy in Kuwait while headed on leave who was doing detainee ops at Camp Bucca,  and I met a random BM2 who was working at the gym at Bagram checking out basketballs.\n\nI ended up meeting a 3rd-class who was selected for an IA and was excited about it. I worked somewhat close to this guy, so I knew him well enough. When it came time for his IA, he asked the right questions for someone thinking long-term, inquiring about how I was commissioned and where I attended college, as well as the number of hours I spent as a TA. The individual was a smart and very well-organized person. He said he wanted to commission after his IA.\n\nWithin a month of this conversation, this dick head decides to get a DUI a few weeks before he is supposed to leave for his IA. He goes to the mast and receives a suspended bust from 3rd class, but he was not eligible to deploy to Afghanistan. We give him some advice to just take this as a learning experience.\n\nMoron decides to smoke spice with Salvia in front of everyone who is on duty on Saturday. He gets told, as suspected, the next day to report to medical for a drug test and gets in a shit ton of trouble.\n\nHe thinks it’s a smart idea to commit larceny, destroy evidence, make death threats to people who were witnesses, and engage in general stupid behavior to try to cover his tracks. He then proceeds to claim he needs rehab, thinking that will save his ass if he goes inpatient. He threatens the poor people in an inpatient setting, with another charge added.\n\nIn reality, he probably would have been separated with a general discharge, maybe a BCD, but it would have been quick. His behavior was so bad that he went to the brig for over a year before his court-martial. He got in a shit ton of trouble in the brig. At his court-martial, the judge rips him hard and gives him 10 years in confinement. I googled the guy's name, and it appears he has been arrested since his release. \n\nThe guy was actually a good dude before all this, but talk about a way to fuck up your life quickly.",

    "text": "The Army is slashing thousands of active duty pilots, flight crews, and helicopter maintenance jobs as the service begins a fundamental pivot towards unmanned drones for modern wars, officials told Task &amp; Purpose.\n\nThe service will begin cutting nearly 6,500 active duty aviation jobs in fiscal years 2026 and 2027 as part of the Army’s broader transformation initiative.\n\nThe Army currently has around 30,000 aviation branch soldiers, but “talent panels” scheduled for October will decide which officers and warrant officers will be retained and which will transfer to a different branch within the Army. The service will also decide whether to hold similar talent panels for its enlisted aviation soldiers, which includes most flight crew and nearly all mechanics and maintenance troops, Army officials said.\n\nThe strategy to cut aviators is a switch from the Army’s efforts to fill out its pilot force less than a decade ago. In 2019, the service offered pay raises and promotion opportunities to meet a warrant officer shortage of almost 700 soldiers.\n\nAs the service reduces its aviation force, Army leaders are doing an ongoing analysis “to determine the appropriate approved excess strength to minimize turbulence,” Russell said. \n\nThe 6,500 cuts are separate from the nearly 4,600 reserve soldiers who are facing cuts, a drawdown reported by Military.com. With those moves, the Army plans to eliminate all Army Reserve helicopter units by the end of the summer.\n\nArmy officials said the Reserve Command is working on its own manpower plan “to address the unique circumstances” for their soldiers.",

    "text": "In January of 2020 I left for basic training. This was just before Covid took hold of the entire world. I was devastated when I learned I wouldn’t see my family on graduation. I went to Fort Lee Virginia where I again grew distraught that I would see my home (New York) was full of dead people coming out of hospitals because of this.. I knew in my heart I would not be seeing my family once again. I started eating more to deal with the stress. I graduated AIT and became a hold over.. shortly after someone in my platoon took their life. It hit hard. I felt similar feelings. I knew I wasn’t doing okay. I had little friendships and people around me noticed that I was mentally struggling and avoided me. Everyday became a battle dealing with the demands and stress of the Army. I didn’t want to seek help because I didn’t have the courage to ask someone to wake up early to walk with me to the mental health clinic. I was then sent to Korea. Separated from everyone I had met and grown to know and live with in the Army. After a month long quarantine I go to my unit where I completely broke down.. I was contemplating buying as many pills as possible and ending it there. But a voice in my heart told me to seek help.. I spent 7 months in Korea constantly being seen by behavioral health. I had a profile that said I can’t use firearms. I felt so useless. So empty and lost. I gained so much weight and began drinking quite a lot that didn’t help me in any way but to feel something other than this misery in my heart. I was admin separated with an honorable discharge.\n\nTo this day I wish it played out differently. I wish I could proudly tell someone I served and I’m a veteran but I feel like a fraud. Like a complete failure everyday. I dream about being in the army still. It was once my determined passion to get in and serve my country.. but I failed when it came time to live it out. \n\nHow is someone like me supposed to leave the past behind me when it was such a defining moment in my life? I’m 25 now (20 when I enlisted) life hasn’t gotten better. The regret and shame still lives with me. I struggle with long term employment and relationships due to my severe anxiety and depression. It’s as if I never had a place in the world let alone the army. \n\nI’m sorry for this rant.. just needed to vent.",

    "text": "I am on a duty bus right now and two senior NCOs are openly talking about stuff like sharia law being implemented in the United States and other far right talking points that are just objectively false. They are saying it loudly and confidently like it is all established fact.\n\nI am not junior to these guys. I'm almost certainly well senior to them, but I am also not in their direct chain and their talking points are all derived from the President's favorite \"news\" outlets. This is happening in a public work setting where other soldiers are listening.\n\nAt what point is it appropriate to step in and challenge that kind of misinformation when the conversation is not directed at you but is happening in front of everyone. I am not trying to argue politics for fun, but it is frustrating to hear leaders confidently repeat things that are clearly misinformed and that start to blur into prejudice rather than fact..\n\nDo you ignore it. Do you correct it. Do you only step in if it directly affects the mission or the soldiers around you.\n\nGenuinely asking where the line is. Thanks\n\nEdit: I should have known better than to ask a legitimate question on here and not expect people to immediately question my leadership instead of engaging with the actual issue. The question was about how you handle misinformation when it is coming directly from the Commander in Chief, especially in light of how aggressively politically appointed leaders have gone after people for dissenting from the President’s agenda. Everyone acts like they would happily stick their neck out on an anonymous forum, but the reality is very different.\n\nWe have already seen how fast the knives come after the killing of Charlie Kirk and the ensuing witch hunt for anyone posting how Kirk pushed violent and divisive rhetoric. And now the White House is publicly throwing Admiral Bradley under the bus now they're under heavy scrutiny. When leaders are getting publicly blamed and careers are on the line, it is not hard to understand why people are cautious about speaking up. Other federal agencies actively asked for tips from staff to rat on each other for the crime of being anti-Trump. ",

The deadline for contractors to make a pitch is Tuesday.\n\n\"\\[We\\] will leverage industry expertise and incentivize a contractor to operate a facility where soldiers want to dine, with better ambience, additional healthy food options, extended operating hours, and more,\" Lt. Gen. Chris Mohan, the acting head of Army Material Command, told lawmakers during an April hearing on the Defense Department's food operations.\n\nThe pilot program, currently open for bids, covers dining operations at five of the Army's largest installations: Fort Bragg, North Carolina; [Fort Carson](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-carson), Colorado; [Fort Stewart](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-stewart), Georgia; [Fort Drum](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-drum), New York; and [Fort Cavazos](https://www.military.com/base-guide/fort-cavazos), Texas.\n\nUnder the proposal, contractors would run the facilities, cover renovation costs up front, and be allowed to sell premium items such as higher-quality meal options, snacks and booze. They would also share the profits with the Army.\n\nThere are few restrictions on what vendors can sell, and they are exempt from following Army nutritional standards altogether, though the service itself also [frequently skirts its own nutrition rules](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2024/02/29/army-going-all-food-kiosks-base-dining-facilities-struggle.html). The Army has also waived compliance with the Berry Amendment, which requires the military to prioritize U.S.-made products or purchase through the Defense Logistics Agency, which governs oversight and logistics of food products for the Pentagon.\n\nFor many of the troops who would be affected, there is no real choice in the matter.\n\nJunior enlisted service members who live in barracks are automatically charged a Basic Allowance for Subsistence, or BAS, amounting to roughly $460 per month. That money is deducted directly from their paychecks, regardless of how often they eat or what they consume, though the service has been largely [unable to account for how that money is spent](https://www.military.com/daily-news/investigations-and-features/2025/02/14/over-151-million-taken-soldiers-paychecks-food-costs-spent-elsewhere-army.html).\n\nUnder the privatized model, the deductions would continue, but soldiers may find themselves paying out of pocket for items not covered in the contractor's meal package under the \"campus-style dining\" initiative.\n\n\"It's important to stress this is a pilot program; we'll be assessing how this goes,\" Col. Junel Jeffrey, a service spokesperson, told Military.com. \"Regular dining facilities are not being replaced.\"\n\nPhrases such as \"high-quality\" and \"fresh\" are used frequently throughout the solicitation for contracts dictating what the Army expects from potential contractors, though the service never defines what those words actually mean.\n\nThe Defense Department has had mixed success with privatizing some of its major quality-of-life services, such as medical care, housing and military [permanent change of station](https://www.military.com/money/pcs-dity-move/pcs-checklists.html) moves.\n\nIt has looked to private companies to tackle some of the department's largest duties since the early 1990s, giving broader access to privately managed health care to family members and retirees, establishing the privatized military housing program to address shortfalls in family housing and, most recently, awarding a contract to a private joint partnership to run military moves.\n\nFor the most part, companies have invested heavily in their military contracts, providing services and benefits beyond what were offered by the Defense Department when it managed the programs.\n\nBut those efforts have not been without trouble and, in some cases, major scandals.\n\nIn 2018, the Reuters news organization uncovered shoddy construction and workmanship, poor service and inadequate maintenance that [contributed to poor health and safety concerns](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2019/02/13/mold-lead-and-vermin-survey-finds-toxic-conditions-military-housing.html) among military families in privatized housing.\n\nA change in [Tricare](https://www.military.com/benefits/tricare) contractors this year continues to affect military families, who have [faced problems getting medical appointments](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/02/05/pentagon-scrambles-fixes-tricare-beneficiaries-western-us-hit-contractor-issues.html) and maintaining their services with private health care providers in a new network managed by TriWest Healthcare Alliance.\n\nAnd as recently as last week, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth [canceled a $7.2 billion contract to a company hired in 2021 to run the services' permanent change of station moves](https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/06/20/hegseth-cancels-massive-contract-military-family-moves-pledges-fixes.html). According to the DoD, the company, HomeSafe Alliance, failed to deliver on promises that it would assume management of nearly all of the DoD's domestic moves this year.\n\nPentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said cancellation of the company's contract was \"for cause due to HSA's demonstrated inability to fulfill their obligations and deliver high-quality moves to service members.\"\"",

Also on the chopping block.\n\t•\tPeople are being marked AWOL for calling out sick even with leave on the books, unless they hand over a doctor’s note — and that’s only being enforced against folks who’ve filed complaints or grievances.\n\nNone of this looks like standard policy enforcement. It looks like retaliation.\n\nThe environment has gotten toxic — and this isn’t just grumbling. It’s stress-related health issues, write-ups, investigations, and removals.

I’m hoping this community, full of people who’ve made the same sacrifices, might get where I’m coming from or just give a lending ear. \n\nA week after I hit 20 years of active duty service, I got into trouble. Nothing violent, no one was hurt, but it was enough for my chain of command to take action. I made a mistake just one, a big one, but after 2 decades of serving honorably without a single issue. No Article 15s, no disciplinary record. And now, instead of an approved retirement in December, they’re trying to involuntarily separate me before/after that date.\n\nThat means I’d lose my retirement pay, my health benefits, everything I earned through 20 years of sacrifice. And I can’t lie…it’s wrecking me emotionally.\n\nI feel like my entire identity is being stripped away. I gave my life to the Army…missed holidays, built my entire adult life around serving. And over one mistake, they’re acting like none of that ever mattered. Like I never served/deployed/did BCT DS time. I’ve seen others do far worse (or do the same and just receive art 15/GOMAR) and walk away with less punishment, and it’s hard not to feel like I’m being made into an example. \n\nI’m being treated like I’m some kind of disgrace…like I was never a good Soldier/NCO/SNCO. But I was &amp; still am. And now I sit here with everything I built for 20 years at risk, and no one around me seems to care what that does to someone mentally/emotionally. \n\nI’m not suicidal, but I am struggling. I feel hopeless and somewhat depressed. I never thought this is how my career would end. I just want to know if anyone else has ever been through something like this—or even just understands what it feels like to be discarded after giving everything.\n\nThanks for letting me get this out. Any support, words of wisdom, or just shared experiences would mean more than you know. Thanks. ✅ \n\nEdit for clarity: I won’t be sharing the specific details of my case or situation. The Army is small, and it’s easy to connect the dots with too much information. What I will say is that it’s not a felony, and has nothing to do with sexual assault, EO, fraternization, or adultery. I also didn’t specifically ask for advice on my original post, but thank you to the ones who gave good info! 👏🏼 \n\nTo those who may be quick to judge or leave negative comments: I won’t be engaging. No one is denying accountability….I fully recognize that I made a mistake. In my case, I stopped the scenario once I recognized things were not ok, got in trouble afterwards. To all you perfect ppl out there….I hope you continue your perfect life and stay perfect 😇\n\nWhat I can share is that I’m a female, and both my 1SG and Commander are advocating for the lowest level of punishment possible. They don’t want my retirement or benefits affected. Unfortunately, our new CSM is pushing for the harshest possible outcome. While the BC initially supported a more measured response, it’s unclear if that will hold under pressure.\n\nAs far as anything goes paperwork wise….I’ve received nothing other than a 4856 and a 268, so far.

    "text": "I feel like I've had an epiphany.\n\nI got out of the military a little more than a year ago. When I first got out I was met with many challenges simultaneously - ongoing divorce, my father passed away 1 month into the start of my first semester, and I was trying to transition from the life I had known for the last 7 years into a college student at 30 years old.\n\nI slowly started to realize the degree program at my school was not preparing me for what I wanted to do for a career (too much focus on non-practical job skills that employers do not care about). I started to apply for jobs doing what I did in the Air Force and landed a well paying job (did not finish my degree) and I am now withdrawing from my classes - as I start the job at the beginning of next month.\n\nUnfortunately this job may not be long lasting as I did self-disclose that I tried weed when I got out of the military (wasn't for me at all) so my clearance may be in jeopardy. Originally I was scared to take this job knowing it may not be long lasting and I'd be uprooting myself. But figured I'll ride it out, save up money, and prepare for the worst. Then I came to a realization.\n\nI've always wanted to travel the United States, visiting each state and just taking in the beauty and freedom. I've now decided if this job doesn't work out, I am going to leverage the AMAZING benefits we get and go chase this bucket list item. I am no longer scared. I will drive across the U.S., do my school work for income, and I'll make some supplemental income in other ways (not bloweys at the truck stop lol) if I have to as well. I'll get to spend at most 2 years traveling the U.S., seeing the sights I've always wanted to see, and getting to experience true freedom and I wouldn't be nearly as carefree about it if I didn't have the income coming in from the benefits. \n\nI almost hope that the job doesn't work out now. Not many people have the chance to make income while traveling and receiving an education. I know it's not for everyone, and it may not even be for me. I'll just have to wait and see. \n\n\n\n",

    "text": "For people who have been in officer-driven, officer-majority/centric places, or can relate to this, what would your advice be? I'm trying to understand the enlisted and officer dynamic better to help with interactions and have an easier time at work. I don't mind being told I'm wrong, if any opinion or thing I have in this post is incorrect, please tell me!\n\nMy goal is to try to understand officers holistically to hopefully have better insight during day-to-day by understanding what the common goals and motivations are. \n\nSo far, I am thinking about the social background, being that the officer is college educated or a West Point grad, makes a middle-class or above salary, versus the enlisted person who is experienced, coming out of high school, and usually with no degree or in the middle of doing one, etc. Then there is also the responsibility dynamic where enlisted people face counseling or UCMJ/demotion but can typically move on and still have Army career prospects, whilst Os face a much higher level of scrutiny. \n\nAnother thing that gets joked around about a lot, but maybe not fully understood, is the MQ dynamic or overall politics. I have read on this sub a lot about how there may be backstabbing, a politically correct culture, and, to my understanding, not receiving MQ for every evaluation can seriously hinder promotion to the point of being forced retired at 16-18 years/MAJ. I wonder how this impacts day to day decisions and interactions with enlisted. \n\nAlso, another thing I wonder about is whether the salary is worth it or not. Sometimes I think I wouldn't care how dumb meetings are if I am about to get paid $7k in a day or two and never be put on shitty details. However, a lot of CPTs seem to be REFRADing.  ",

As a kid I decided i wanted to go into the military and that would be my career, never really considered an alternate route.

While I was there I immediately got a PL slot and was moved up to XO at the 12 month mark. I split the rest of my time between XO and working as the BDE S3 CUOPS, overall was making a good impression. I get to being a CPT and stayed FORSCOM, this time choosing to got to Fort Hood to be closer to my wife’s work. I was put in 3CR and despite having no S2 experience I ended up rocking that job. I trusted my leadership would take care of me, I was doing a good job because i thought the rest would take care of itself. At 12 months, while in Korea I got rated and HQ with my CDR giving his word that i would get an MQ at 18 months so I could stay in the Army. At 18 months I got a great write up (top 15%, send to resident ILE now) but still an HQ, my CDR neglected to tell me that his profile did not support an MQ. I had stuck with that unit through a lot of crappy times but that really broke my trust and now my career is in jeopardy. That being said I changed unit but I know i’ll experience leaders like that again. I want to be there for my Soldiers but I don’t know if it’s worth stressing my self out and putting strain on my marriage. When did yall know it was time to get out? ",

    "title": "VETERAN CAREER",
    "text": "Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working alongside veterans from the Navy, Army, Air Force, and beyond. They are wired differently. The discipline instilled in them is unlike anything most people ever experience. One trait that stands out above all is their bias for action. You don’t need to ask them to step in, they simply do. They offer a hand where needed, respond to situations outside their job description, and carry themselves with a readiness that inspires everyone around them.\n\nI often asked them: *Why are you different? Does your service shape who you become in life?*\n\nFast forward to today. I was driving home from an event in the Midwest after a heavy snowstorm with nearly 10 inches had fallen, and the roads were still being cleared. Exhausted, I decided to pull over at a crossroads since the next rest stop was 15 miles away. As I turned, my car suddenly slid out of control and lodged itself in a pile of snow. Thankfully, it wasn’t damaged, but I couldn’t move it no reversing, no turning, no progress.\n\nI switched on my hazard lights and called 911, hoping they could connect me with a local tow company. No luck. The nearest help was at least an hour away. I tried AT&amp;T roadside assistance and my insurance company, but again, no immediate solution. Finally, AT&amp;T called back: a tow truck could come in 75 minutes, 30 miles away, at a cost of $195. By then, I had already been stranded for an hour, with cars passing by and drivers staring but not stopping.\n\nI stepped out to stretch my legs when a truck pulled over. An older man approached and asked if I needed help. I explained the situation and that I’d been waiting for roadside assistance and it would be another hour. He told me to cancel the call. He’d rush home, grab a shovel, and come back to help.\n\nTrue to his word, he returned within 15 minutes, shoveled the snow, and guided me as I reversed and drove forward. With his push, I was free in just two minutes. When I asked what I owed him, he said, “Nothing. I served 25 years as a veteran, and I continue to serve my fellow citizens. You don’t owe me anything.”\n\nI was stunned. He saved me $195 and another hour of waiting. More than that, he reminded me of what I’ve always known: veterans carry their service into every part of their lives. Their instinct to act, to help, and to serve doesn’t end when they leave the military, it becomes who they are. There people like me who appreciate all you veterans do.\n\nTHANKYOU FOR YOUR SERVICE.",

RS1: 12FEB\n3. Transitions: 21FEB\n4. Transition 2: 21FEB\n5. HRC: 14MAR\n6. Transitions 3: 21MAR\n7. Orders Received: 21MAR\n8. Complete 25MAR in IPPSA (not included in time to get orders)\n\nThe only ones you really have to do in order are the BC then the RCO documents. The rest you can pursue simultaneously.\n\n# 2 Complete Soldier for Life Transition Assistance Program (SFLTAP)\n\nTAP Steps Include:\n\n1.    Initial Counseling: Done through tap POC.\n\n2.    Pre-separation counseling: These were done every Tuesday on Fort Myer and take about two hours. Mine started at 0900 and I was never emailed, so ensure that they have your proper email.  (04FEB25)\n\n3.    Complete Mandatory Tap Classes (I did mine from 31MAR-04APR). This can be done either online or in-person. The in-person classes are 5 days of class at Fort Myer: To complete Transition workshop courses online, just go to ([https://www.tapevents.mil/courses](https://www.tapevents.mil/courses)). The list of courses to be completed are listed below. I have also attached a copy of the (LMS tip sheet), on how to navigate the TAP Events website. Once you have completed the certificates, please send back over to the counselor, so the DD2648 eform can be updated. \n\na.    Week of Classes at Fort Myer Takes Care of the following steps:\n\ni.    [https://www.tapevents.mil/resources/documents](https://www.tapevents.mil/resources/documents)\n\nii.    Managing (My) Transition \n\n1.    Day One Army Day\n\niii.    Military Occupation Code (MOC) Crosswalk\n\n1.    Day One Army Day\n\niv.    Financial Planning For Transition\n\n1.    Day One Army Day\n\nv.    VA Benefits and Services\n\n1.    Day Five VA Benefits and Services\n\nvi.    DOL Employment Fundamentals of Career Transition\n\n1.    Day Two Fundamentals of DOL (Department of Labor)\n\n2.    Day Three DOL Employment Workshop Day 1\n\n3.    Day Four DOL Employment Workshop Day 2\n\n4.    Capstone NLT 90 days out (I did mine on 9APR25)\n\na.    This portion was a meeting that took 10 min.\n\nb.    DD2648 is routed to the CO for signature mine was not signed until 23APR.\n\nOnce complete with these forms and the capstone, you will get the DD2648.  (23APR)\n\n# 3 Submit VA Claim / ETS Physical\n\nYou will need to complete your physical 6 months from your separation dates.\n\n·         Timeline\n\no   **180 to 90 days to ETS date use for the benefits delivery discharge BDD this is the fastest type of claim**\n\no   FDC is less than 90 days when you do the claim\n\no   Within 1 year from ETS date, is the third option\n\n·         Separation history and Physical Examination (SHPE)\n\no   File and FDC between 89-0 days before separation\n\no   Does not file a disability claim at all\n\n·         Separation Health Assessment (SHA)\n\no   This one is done only if you are filing a claim\n\no   File a BDD claim between 180 and 90 days\n\no   Request examination with at least 90 days remaining on active duty\n\n·         First step to filing whatever type of claim you will do is requesting a copy of your medical records from the records department.\n\no   Fort Myer Medical Records at Rader said it would take 30-60 days mine was put in on 18FEB and did not get them all back until 15APR (longer than normal)\n\no   You have to get Dental separately at Fort Myer it takes a week and mine was put in 18FEB It was ready on 10MAR\n\n·         I submitted my claim on 16APR using a Veteran’s Service Organization (VSO). All I needed was my medical records and marriage certificate. We went through the records and submitted a claim. Your TAP office may have a list of VSOs for your area.\n\n**ETS Physical (Steps for Fort Myer)**\n\n·         I am including this step here since many people will complete health related steps concurrently. Complete 01MAY\n\n·         Go to [www.mods.army.mil](http://www.mods.army.mil)\n\n·         Find the link for MHA (PHA/DHA/Referral Tracking). And log in with CAC\n\n·         In the yellow bar, click the SHPE tab\n\n·         Complete DD Forms:\n\no   2697\n\no   2807-1\n\no   2808\n\no   Once all of the forms are complete, contact your clinic to schedule appointment.\n\n# 4 CSP/ Skillbridge\n\nThis is an optional step and requires commander approval. This step is the most likely to change depending on your location or time of submitting. Some of the steps below are specific for The Old Guard at Fort Myer, but the steps are listed to show how arduous the process is.\n\nHere is the general information:\n\nEligibility:\n\n·         Have not participated in CSP before\n\n·         Within 180 days of UQR\n\n·         On track to receive honorable or general discharge under honorable conditions\n\n·         Will complete all tap classes prior to start of CSP\n\nPacket Submission Requirements (many are specific to TOG):\n\n1.    MFR - request and intent signed by SM (section 9 of tog policy letter #11) complete\n\n2.    MFR – concurrence / non-concurrence signed by company and battalion commander (took a week for signature and be sure the BC signs it even though there is not a space for him)\n\n3.    Individual internship/ approved DOD skillbridge program requirements with tap office 14FEB25\n\na.    part i: overview of internship\n\nb.    part ii: employer internship agreement\n\nc.    part iii: legal review (keep unsigned) \\*legal review will occur after submission to rs1\n\nd.    part iv: IMCOM review and IMCOM form 45 signed by company /battalion commander\n\ni.    Note this requirement changed as of the MILPER in APR2025. I had to resubmit on 14APR25 with the new IMCOM 45\n\n4.    Verify/ Confirm Approval Authority (NOW CHANGING WITH NEW MILPER)\n\na.    CSP within 50 mile radius and &lt; 60 days = battalion commander\n\nb.    CSP within 50 mi radius and 61-90 days, or &gt;50 mi radius and 1-90 days = regimental commander (RCO)\n\nc.    CSP 91-120 days, regardless of location = commanding general (CG)\n\nd.    CSP 121+ days, regardless of location = commanding general (CG)\n\n5.    IPPSA Leave Submitted Prior to Routing for RC Signature. (Only applies if you will be outside of 50 mile radius)\n\na.    All administrative absence requests associated with a CSP request must end no less than 14 days prior to the start date of terminal leave or the SM’s ETS date if not taking any terminal leave. Any ETS leave that is requested must also be factored into the length of the CSP to accommodate the 180-day requirement directed by regulation.\n\nNote: I did a pre-approved Hiring Our Heroes Fellowship that I applied at here: [https://www.hiringourheroes.org/career-services/fellowships/fellowship-programs-application/](https://www.hiringourheroes.org/career-services/fellowships/fellowship-programs-application/). I did this way in advance and needed the IMCOM 45 form signed by the BC to even start the process with the HOH rep. My command signature was due on 13FEB25, but the Internship did not even start until 05MAY25, so be aware of these lead-times. I would not necessarily recommend HOH since every company that I heard back from I had to reach out to. I did not get my first acceptance back until 26MAR and other offers were coming after the deadline.\n\n# 5 Clear Post Steps Specific to Fort Myer\n\n·         I received the ICP request form and privacy act statement from the transition services branch, go through your S-1 to obtain clearing documents. You will get these 10 days prior to ETS. (25JUL-11AUG)\n\no   To get your installation clearing papers from S1, you need:\n\n§  Clearance request signed by 1SG/CDR/S1\n\n§  Privacy Act Statement\n\n§  Copy of orders\n\n§  Copy of leave form\n\n·         **Finance Info Sheet**. You will need to complete the separation brief and virtual turn in of your packet before you clear MPD transitions. When I was completing this process it switched from virtual, to in-person, back to virtual.\n\no   Packet sent to finance distro\n\n§  Separation orders\n\n§  DD214 Worksheet\n\n§  Separation/ retirement interview sheet: sent as a part of your packet or from S1\n\no   Required Timeline for Service Members: \n\n§  Service members must walk in at least 60 days before the start of their leave (if applicable), or 60 days prior to their separation/retirement date if no leave is being taken. \n\n·         **Documents Submission:** \n\no   MPD will continue to provide Finance with the Orders and DD214 Worksheet via email. (If both MPD Offices do not mind, can the Finance Separations Interview Checklist be attached when the service member comes to MPD and are given their orders and DD214 worksheet.)  \n\no   Service members will not be able to submit documents via email. If they attempt to, they will receive an out-of-office reply (attached) directing them to our walk-in hours. \n\no   Updated Interview Checklist: \n\n§  The Interview Checklist has been updated and will now be completed during the service member's walk-in time, so please disregard the previous checklist. \n\n·         **Separation Briefs:** You will need to attend a separation brief. Mine was on 13MAY over teams.\n\n·         All ICP request must be sent to the ICP mailbox: USARMY JBM-HH ASA\n\n·         Send any updates for your DD 214 WS back to transition branch as soon as possible along with supporting documentation. \n\n·         If you plan on signing a contract with the Reserves or National Guard; provide the documentation (DA 5961 or DD4). This is not applicable if you are doing IRR\n\n# 6 Terminal Leave\n\n·         Submit your terminal leave up to 60 days (Mine was from 11AUG-04OCT)\n\n·         I timed mine to coincide with my CSP and not go over the 180 days.\n\n·         It was routed through my company commander and I needed it submitted to approve the CSP and the leave approved to submit for the clearing papers.\n\n# Timeline from Start to Finish\n\n||\n||\n|**Activity**|**REFRAD STEP**|**Start**|**End**|**Total Time**|\n|Started REFRAD Process|1 Submit PAR|23-Oct|4-Oct|346|\n|SHARP Memo|1 Submit PAR|23-Oct|23-Oct|0|\n|Non-Adso Memo|1 Submit PAR|12-Nov|14-Nov|2|\n|Reserve Component Memo|1 Submit PAR|12-Nov|20-Nov|8|\n|REFRAD Counseling (BC)|1 Submit PAR|12-Dec|12-Dec|0|\n|REFRAD Counseling (RCO)|1 Submit PAR|28-Jan|28-Jan|0|\n|Initial TAP Counseling|2 Complete SFLTAP|28-Jan|28-Jan|0|\n|Pre-Sep Tap Brief|2 Complete SFLTAP|4-Feb|4-Feb|0|\n|IMCOM 45 (BC Signed)|4 CSP|5-Feb|5-Feb|0|\n|REFRAD PAR IPPSA|1 Submit PAR|5-Feb|25-Mar|48|\n|Skillbridge (HOH) through tap|4 CSP|14-Feb|14-Feb|0|\n|Medical records|3 Submit VA Claim|18-Feb|15-Apr|56|\n|CSP XO approval|4 CSP|27-Feb|27-Feb|0|\n|CSP request signed by CO|4 CSP|4-Mar|4-Mar|0|\n|CSP request signed by BC|4 CSP|7-Mar|7-Mar|0|\n|HOH Company offer|4 CSP|26-Mar|26-Mar|0|\n|TAP Classes|2 Complete SFLTAP|31-Mar|4-Apr|4|\n|TAP CAPSTONE|2 Complete SFLTAP|9-Apr|9-Apr|0|\n|Signed 2648 TAP|2 Complete SFLTAP|9-Apr|23-Apr|14|\n|CSP S1 review|4 CSP|10-Apr|10-Apr|0|\n|CSP RS1 review|4 CSP|13-Apr|13-Apr|0|\n|Submit VA Claim|3 Submit VA Claim|16-Apr|16-Apr|0|\n|CSP RS2 resubmit|4 CSP|17-Apr|17-Apr|0|\n|CSP RXO approval|4 CSP|23-Apr|23-Apr|0|\n|CSP RSM approval|4 CSP|25-Apr|25-Apr|0|\n|Finance Separation Brief|5 Clear Post|29-Apr|29-Apr|0|\n|Separation Physical SHPE|5 Clear Post|1-May|1-May|0|\n|CSP RCO approval|4 CSP|1-May|1-May|0|\n|CSP|4 CSP|5-May|24-Jul|80|\n|Separation Brief|5 Clear Post|13-May|13-May|0|\n|Clear Post|5 Clear Post|25-Jul|10-Aug|16|\n|Terminal Leve|6 Terminal Leave|11-Aug|4-Oct|54|\n\n \n\n# Useful Links:\n\n·         Officer Separations Guidance: [https://www.hrc.army.mil/content/Regular%20Army%20Voluntary%20Separations%20page](https://usg01.safelinks.protection.office365.us/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hrc.army.mil%2Fcontent%2FRegular%2520Army%2520Voluntary%2520Separations%2520page&amp;data=05%7C02%7Canthony.l.deltufo.mil%40army.mil%7C5e2e90b605a74919f87008dd09814799%7Cfae6d70f954b481192b60530d6f84c43%7C0%7C0%7C638677173015424630%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=GGqQuSZAH7cjvNHEqm8INAZKn%2FaKlFB3%2FdcJPVlBOPs%3D&amp;reserved=0)\n\n·         All tap classes:\n\no   [https://www.tapevents.mil/resources/documents](https://www.tapevents.mil/resources/documents)\n\n·         Virginia Works (American Job Center): [https://www.virginiaworks.gov](https://www.virginiaworks.gov)\n\n·         Career One Stop: [https://www.careeronestop.org/](https://www.careeronestop.org/)\n\n·        Civilian Military Calculator shows my income at $141.309.44 for the are\n\no   [https://militarypay.defense.gov/Calculators/RMC-Calculator/](https://militarypay.defense.gov/Calculators/RMC-Calculator/)\n\n·        Smart Asset paycheck calculator shows what you will make after state and federal taxes.\n\no   [https://smartasset.com/taxes/paycheck-calculator](https://smartasset.com/taxes/paycheck-calculator)\n\n§  I need to make 155k to break even based on current take-home salary\n\n·         What am I worth: [www.salary.com](https://www.salary.com) mine says 161k\n\n·         Cost of living resources/ calculators to see how much you need to make based on where you are now\n\no   [https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/](https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/)\n\no   [https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living-calculator/](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/cost-of-living-calculator/)\n\no   [https://smartasset.com/mortgage/cost-of-living-calculator](https://smartasset.com/mortgage/cost-of-living-calculator)\n\n·         Most of the content for VA transition information is at:\n\no   [https://discover.va.gov/transition-programs/transition-assistance-program/](https://discover.va.gov/transition-programs/transition-assistance-program/)\n\n# Credentialing Assistance\n\nJust wanted to share some other resources that the Army offers Using your credentialing assistance **does not incur and ADSO.**\n\nThis is the link to do credentialing assistance if you want to.

    "title": "PSA:  Before getting out of the military",
    "text": "I’d seen questions on and off here about things to do, see, consider before getting out of the military … here’s at least my short list.\n\n1) Medical Stuff\n- Get copies of your medical records\n- Make sure you’ve been seen for absolutely EVERY EVERY problem you have or have had in the military, you want this documented in your medical records.  (Did I say every?)\n- You can now begin to submit information to the VA for a potential claim before getting out — talk with a VSO (Veterans Service Organization) for help with this.  BUT you can do it on your own with enough research.  For most a VSO can be very helpful.  VSO LINK: https://www.va.gov/resources/va-accredited-representative-faqs/\n- Get a copy of your DD 214 and save it somewhere good.  You can download it but some organizations may need the one with the embossed seal.\n- VA Claims —  [Free chatbot](https://www.vadisabilitychat.com) that can help provide guidance on VA Claims.\n\n2) Personal stuff\n- Get copies of your performance reports, those may be helpful when applying for a job in the real world.\n- Letters of recommendation from peers / superiors — these may be helpful in getting a job.  \n- Not sure what you want to do?  https://www.militaryonesource.mil/education-employment/for-service-members/your-career-path-finding-the-right-job/ — find something that you think could interest you and give it a try, you can always switch (you’re not stuck there).  Many companies love hiring military folks, but more for entry level roles since you don’t have the business etc experience.  \n- Education / College?  Many states have free community college.  Or try a 4 year school… or you can do community college then transfer to a 4 year school and graduate just after 2 years.\n- GI Bill Transfers:  If you’re planning to transfer your GIBill to spouse or dependent, do that before you leave.\n\n3) Where to live?\n- Many states have no income tax — that’s like an automatic salary bonus. https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0210/7-states-with-no-income-tax.aspx\n- Many states have additional benefits for veterans who are rated by the VA — the benefits depend on the rating eg: 50%, 100%, etc … benefits could be free hunting/fishing licenses, lower or no real estate taxes, free car tags, even a waiver of sales tax (Oklahoma).\n- Veterans groups — many states and cities have veterans groups for networking and / or help.  Some are non-profits that can help you find direction, jobs, help, etc….\n\nI’m sure there are definitely more.\n\nEDITS:\n- Added GI Bill Transfers\n\n\n",

    "title": "Outdoor Rec &amp; ITT…call for support.",
    "text": "TLDR:  Please support these org’s. If they aren’t used and operate in the red another year, bases are going to start loosing them. I’ll explain the details down below, but trust me that these places save us AD &amp; retirees a lot of money compared to private companies imbedded in the surrounding communities. \n\n\n\n\nWhat’s up folks. Just for full disclosure here, I don’t work at either.  I’ll be retiring very soon and won’t have access to them because I’m relocating no where near a base. \n\nBut, I’m currently on leave after tacking that onto a TDY to JBER. We used the ITT and Outdoor Rec to book some trips, buy tickets, and rent some fishing gear. While checking in and checking out equipment I made it a point to speak with management. The employees are NAF employees, and most don’t earn a very high salary. Each of them I spoke with, simply love the outdoors and want to help military members. I noticed their staff was limited so I started asking questions. It was explained to me that in the past, many of the base “extras” (golf, lodging, outdoor rec, itt, storage lots) were all operated under a single funding umbrella.  The money makers were the golf course (in some locations) and the storage lots.  Those made up for the others who normally operated in the red (cost more to operate than they earned).  \n\nWell in the last few years (this isn’t politics because it was before admin changes), they started breaking up their funding. With that, they said that every entity must at least break-even or face being closed down. \n\nThis concerns me because over the last 20 years, I’ve seen installations loosing this stuff. \n\nAndrews for instance lost their Garage center. Amn aren’t allowed to change their own oil or perform MX on their cars in the dorms, and the base tells them to pay Firestone on base or similar off base…. Cool. Firestone was charging $100 for an oil change, where’s as Amn used to have the option to learn how to perform this mx for nothing more than the cost of oil (maybe $20-25). That just one example…\n\nI’ve bases loosing wood shops, garages, Outdoor Recs, etc. \n\nI realize those places may not be on the forefront of your mind, but I ask folks to check them out. Even more so if you, or your troops are new to a base that’s drastically different than where they enlisted or commissioned from.  It’s a great way to check out the local area and save money doing it.  Up in JBER, we rented ATV’s at half the cost of off base. Our tickets from ITT saved us another $100 for the 2 tickets. \n\nThis is just my plug to help those organizations out. I’d hate to see those after me not have the opportunity to utilize such service’s. ",

    "text": "This is a longer one so I will order a large Baconator now and something at the end. You guys and gals ever reflect on your service and think maybe you didn’t make the right decision? \n\nI went to basic training in 1999, right after graduating high school in a really small, southern town. After two enlistments I ETS’d, got a couple of good civilian jobs, went back to school, did ROTC, came back in the Army (I know), and hit 20 a couple years ago. I started writing this last night two Old Fashions and a Sidecar into it. \n\nI have been a commo guy in an Infantry Battalion, supported Intel and Special Forces units in South America, was one of the first AD Soldiers on ground after Hurricane Katrina (sorry 82nd), was a PL in Kandahar (city, not KAF), ROTC instructor, Commander in TRADOC, and now have a really sweet job working Acquisitions (why I am still hanging around). \n\nI left home because there weren’t a lot of opportunities there (and to get my starter marriage knocked out). My current job gives me the opportunity to interact almost exclusively with civilians. Looking at those people, people back home, (wherever that is now) and just the regular public I am not convinced that the last 20+ years were really worth it. \n\nMost of us know that you will miss holidays and special events. After 20 years I don’t have a meaningful relationship with any family and don’t really know most of them anymore. Friends from back home are pretty much faces on social media now. Moving every two years and a spouse that primarily speaks another language makes connections difficult. \n\nI was really looking forward to retiring and finding something I enjoy but not worry about chasing a salary. Unfortunately due the current cost of living I will probably have to chase the money for a while. Meanwhile people back home have been living and working in the same place for years…homes have to be close to paid off…and they seem to have meaningful relationships. \n\nThat aside, the people and Government we serve are frustrating at best. Our elected officials become far wealthier than their constituents while serving and engage in political theater that only vilifies the “other” side. They hide pork projects in thousand page legislation and tell us “we have to pass it to find out what’s in it”. \n\nUnfortunately many of our military leaders aren’t any better. We reward sycophants and yes men by promoting them thus perpetuating the system. The cult of personality v substance largely rules the day for us as well. I don’t know any GOs and few O6s in my current or former branch that make me want to continue service. \n\nThe people, as a whole, in the U.S. are irritating. They are rude and entitled while they enjoy luxuries that others don’t even know exist. They hide behind keyboards or form their action/protest groups without ever really putting anything at risk. They have the nerve to curse you out in traffic as they safely speed away. \n\nSo all of this is what we are serving and sacrificing for?\n\nGive me the biggest frosty you have while I mull this over.

    "text": "TL/DR: Recently retired after 20 years, transitioned into the banking industry in corporate America, but thinking about giving it up and living the retired life. I need help getting out of the golden handcuffs. \n\nMy transition out of the military was the smoothest that could've been asked for. My command gave me an entire year and half to prepare. Because of that, I walked into a corporate job with a nice salary on day one of terminal leave. I received 100% disability right away. My retirement and Disability check pays for all household bills and the corporate job check goes majority to saving and the reminder to discretionary spending. \n\nAfter a year of working in corporate America, I'm realizing that the 9-5 is not the life for me. I have made peace with leaving. But the money is good! Without the civilian job, I would have roughly $1,500 leftover monthly for groceries and gas for the family. While this is doable, nothing would be added to savings or investments. I will be using the GI bill soon and that will take the number up to $2,500 leftover monthly. \n\nMy problem is that while I plan to take a few months off and decompress, I have no other outlook for future careers once I decide to get back into the work force. The military gave me the fulfillment I needed and checked that life box. Is this a bad move financially? Anyone have a similar story of living off their military retirement and disability?",

    "text": "Sisters and brothers, I hope you are all living the dream. \n\nI [saw a recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1kosoti/dont_be_proud/) (shout out to u/fishous) that grabbed my attention, and I wanted to piggyback off of their great advice and story to guide you a little bit on the journey I took that led to successful claims on my physical issues that got be compensation after I got out. This little bit of money, isn't really a little bit, it sits right around $4,600 a month, on top of my already six figure salary, this goes a long way in putting my family into a position of financial freedom. It has helped me to bootstrap my own company and has provided the ease of mind of knowing that I don't have to worry about money every month. \n\nMy story started shortly after Airborne School, I had some pretty good falls and others that were not so great. That was just a start of my soon-to-be knee and ankle problems. After getting to my first Duty station I made it to my infantry scout platoon. We deployed to Iraq in 2006 and while in Mosul I encountered more IEDs than I'd like to count. On a night insertion, we had a Humvee rear end us going about 35 mph when we were at a dead stop. With a combination of kinetic force and the fact that we were wearing night vision goggles the sheer pain that I felt that day I carry with me to this day. I reported that right away to our PA once we returned. Throughout the rest of the deployment the IDS rattled my teeth and caused chronic headaches that I still have some issues to this day. \n\nAfter I got back from Iraq I tried out at SFAS and broke my foot on the Long Trek, but I did finish but came in a little slow, literally as they were packing up the clock. I had to cut my boot off, thank God we were on soft shoe profile. I didn't want to tell the cadre that I knew my foot was broken and hopes that they would still select me, I was told to come back when I was older and had more combat time. My heart was broken along with my foot... When I got back to my unit I got a couple days off and my wife at the time came in and saw my foot and it was a dark combination of black and blue. We went in and got an x-rayed and that's when I found out my second and third metatarsal had been fractured. \n\nAfter my 2009 deployment to Afghanistan, I went off to pre Ranger where the belly buster caused me to fall in a 90° sitting position and I landed so hard that even the Ranger Instructors showed empathy. I went to the PA and got it checked out, he gave me a shot and sent me packing. I returned a month later and this time went through Free Ranger just fine and during Ranger school had another issue with my back and I quickly reported it where they sent me to the hospital for a quick review, it was documented and I was sent right back the same day luckily they didn't make me recycle. I will note that I passed. So, even if you are going to go to a school it doesn't hurt to at least get it documented right there. \n\nWhen I decided to ETS I went through TAPs, at Fort Carson they make you visit with the Disabled American Veterans (DAV). They will offer to file or initiate your claim process for you right there on the spot. All of the organizations like them and even your county VSO get a limited power of attorney to represent you directly with the VA. I encourage each and every one of you to initiate this process prior to getting out. Do not wait and do not try to do it by yourself. \n\nAfter I hung out my uniform it was only a matter of a couple months before I got my 90% permanent and total rating and the DAV initiated a request for a follow-up and MRIs. Within only 3 months I got a $10,000 back paycheck and an award of 100% permanent and total. \n\nDuring my transition process I also went to the VA and started counseling to deal with my emotions and other issues. PTSD is a real thing and having been part of the troop surge in both Iraq and Afghanistan really took a toll. There was also the issue of transitioning away from the Army, like some of the posts that happened today, the Army was very good to me and I loved my time. I cherish it and I enjoy scrolling the subreddit, living vicariously through you all. \n\nAll that said I also wanted to address some of the other things that I'm seeing on this subreddit: depression and suicidal ideations. As I made rank and had my own platoon, during and after afghanistan, I made it very clear to all of my Soldiers that they should always seek out help. During a weekend brief, I retapped on this and our First Sergeant made passing remarks that counseling was for pussies. That still sits heavy with me to this day. If you need help, grab a Battle get the help now.\n\nJust before I got out I was in charge of the holdover platoon and had a soldier attempt suicide twice, the third time he used a shotgun. I sat with him during both failed attempts and the ER. I tried everything to keep him alive, offered him everything I could. A month ago I had one of my former soldiers hang himself. Just last year suicide by overdose. And the year before that alcohol abuse. If you see somebody struggling, be the first one to ask that uncomfortable question \"are you thinking of killing yourself?\" Those Soldiers I lost to suicide, I wonder if it was that passing comment or that same stigma that 1SG had that kept them from getting help.\n\nBottom line:  \nDocument everything. I documented in schools, training, during deployment with my medics/PA, quick visits to sick call. Just do it. If you don’t, it’s hard to prove what happened later. Without proper documentation, you're far less likely to receive a permanent and total rating - or any rating at all. Don’t walk this path alone use a VSO. If you’re feeling suicidal, reach out to a battle buddy or a hot line. If you’re hurt, report it -no matter how small it seems. The older version of you will thank you. So will your family.\n\nGodspeed, brothers and sisters.\n\nThis old man is feeling sleepy; probably why I am all over the place with this post.\n\n\\-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-\n\nMilitary OneSource: 1-800-342-9647\n\nSuicide Hot Line: 988 press 1, or text 838255\n\nDO NOT PAY ANYONE TO FILE YOUR CLAIM!

    "title": "Retired/Current USAF Officers – Was retiring as an officer worth it, and how did it impact your post-military life?",
    "text": "I’m looking for some honest insight from current or retired USAF officers. Specifically, for those who retired after 20+ years, do you feel it was worth it? And how did it affect your life after the military — financially, emotionally, professionally? Was it a smooth transition to civilian work or did you face challenges?\n\nHere’s where I’m at:\nI’m currently enlisted, 6 years in, in the cyber field. I’ve already passed the AFOQT and have my bachelor’s, so I’m qualified to apply for a commission. By the end of my current contract, I’ll be at the 9-year mark. I’m at a bit of a crossroads and weighing two main options:\n\nOption 1: Use Tuition Assistance (TA) while I’m still in to knock out additional education, then separate at the end of my contract. After that, I’d plan to use the GI Bill for a master’s or go after high-value certs, then break into the civilian tech world. From what I’ve seen and researched, six-figure salaries are very realistic, especially with my background.\n\nOption 2: Apply for a commission, go officer, and stay in to complete 20. The pension starting at age 49 is a huge incentive. Job stability, benefits, and leadership experience are all solid upsides. But I’m concerned that by going officer, I’ll drift too far from hands-on technical work. I worry that after 20 years, I may not be competitive in the civilian cyber/IT space due to lack of current technical skills.\n\nSo my big questions are:\n\t•\tFor those who retired as officers, was it worth it in the long run?\n\t•\tDid the pension and experience outweigh the opportunity cost of not getting out earlier and going private sector?\n\t•\tHow was the transition to civilian work — smooth or difficult, especially in technical fields like cyber or IT?\n\t•\tIf you could go back, would you still choose the officer-to-retirement route?\n\nAny perspective — good, bad, or mixed — would be greatly appreciated. Just trying to make the most informed decision I can while I still have some time left on contract.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",

Even though we wore different uniforms and served in different countries, I feel connected to you through that military brotherhood. Reading your comments made me feel less alone.

I keep thinking about the military every single day, and I can’t shake the feeling that I abandoned not only my career but also the health insurance my family relied on.\n\nI don’t know how to move forward or how to find meaning in civilian life.

    "title": "Struggling to find footing after the military | I’ve done all of the \"things\" I was told to do but I'm still severely underemployed and have no meaningful connections 6 years out of the military",
    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI just need to get this out somewhere. Maybe someone’s been through something similar.\n\n**TL;DR:** Got out of the Navy in 2019 → went to college → worked and studied nonstop → finished my degree in 2024 → spent six months unemployed → took a low-paying job just to survive → now I’m a licensed loan officer but still struggling mentally and professionally as I'm not making anything of myself in this profession.\n\n**The longer story:**\n\nI got out of the military in 2019 and immediately enrolled in college in Seattle with a buddy. Things were going well until COVID hit. Suddenly, my engineering classes went fully online. I lost access to teachers, tutors, labs — basically any kind of support system. Isolation hit me hard, and I spiraled. I failed Calculus II and decided to change my major to business.\n\nNot long after, I moved across the country for a private contracting job in New York working under a top-secret clearance. It paid well and went great for about 18 months. When management positions opened up (twice), I made it clear I was ready and capable — but got ignored each time. They hired people who quit within six months both times. So, I decided to leave, finish my business degree, and try to build a better long-term path.\n\nFrom 2022 to early 2024, I was a full-time business student. I sold my house, moved back home to Wichita, KS, and started job hunting in March while finishing my last semester. By June, I had my degree… but still no luck finding work.\n\nSix months later, I’d sent out nearly 200 applications. I got only three callbacks: two were MLM scams and one was a low-paying assistant job at a mortgage company. I took the assistant job because I needed *something* — I was living in my dad’s basement and losing my mind. I got licensed as a loan officer during that time and stayed on as an assistant while I learned the business.\n\nThen my boss started berating women in the office — yelling, screaming, public humiliation-type stuff. I couldn’t stay silent, so I spoke up and, after enough incidents, I quit. I won’t work for someone who treats people like that, no matter the cost. I have my values and my honor — things I will *never* let go of. The military taught me more about how to treat people than anyone else ever has, and I despair at how few people seem to have actual values in the civilian world.\n\nIn January 2025, I joined another company as a loan officer. I knew it’d be tough, but I’m still struggling to gain traction — despite networking, hiring resume writers, working with recruiters, and trying to translate my Navy nuclear background into civilian terms.\n\nNow, 11 months into this job, I’ve realized I’m technically in **debt** to my company because my “base salary” is actually a draw against commissions. And I can’t get sales to close to save my life, which just puts me deeper in the hole each month.\n\nWhat’s worse, I’m another 40-something job applications deep with not a single solid lead on a better or more stable position.\n\nOn top of all this, I’ve been battling severe depression. I actually had to move all my firearms to my dad’s house because I don’t trust myself anymore. If it weren’t for my folks caring about me, I probably wouldn’t still be here.\n\nI haven’t really formed any deep friendships or relationships since getting out. Civilians just… don’t feel the same. In the Navy, even if a shipmate made your life miserable, you knew they’d have your back when things got bad. Out here, it feels like people’s words don’t mean anything. I’m the guy everyone calls when they need a hand, have a crisis, or need someone reliable — but when I need help? Crickets and no-shows.\n\nLately, I’ve been thinking about admitting myself to the VA for inpatient mental health care, even if it would wreck me financially or cost me my house. I’m just tired — tired of feeling like I’ve done everything I’m supposed to and still can’t get my life off the ground.

    "text": "Why doesn’t the Army rely more on trained military personnel—either from active duty or the Reserve—rather than outsourcing so many roles to civilian contractors? Wouldn’t hiring soldiers who already understand military systems, discipline, and chain of command be more efficient and cost-effective in the long run? Contractors often come with higher salaries and overhead costs, while military personnel are already paid through existing defense budgets and can be mobilized faster with less onboarding time. So, when comparing time, money, training, and mission readiness, wouldn’t utilizing Reserve or active-duty service members make more sense than relying heavily on contractors?",

This role is primarily a field role, doing microwave radio LOS installs, deinstalls, troubleshooting, cabling, etc. We deal primarily with Ubiquiti equipment on the radio side, (with some Ceragon and Nera thrown in) with some Cisco and Ubiquiti middle-mile gear (switches, routers). \n\nI had the bright idea of hiring some ex-military folks. Some research showed that the following MOS's deal with LOS (Line-of-sight) communications gear:\n\nArmy:\n\n25S\n\n25Q\n\n25N\n\n25H/25U (apparently Q/N were phased out...)\n\nUSAF:\n\nAFSC 3D1X2\n\nAFSC 1D7X1A\n\nUSMC:\n\n0621/0627\n\n0651\n\nUSN:\n\nIT Rate or\n\nET Rate\n\nMy question is: In these jobs, what ranks (E4, E5?) deal mostly with the physical aspects of creating microwave LOS links? Erecting poles, hanging radios, aligning and programming them, etc? How much basic TCP/IP networking would people with these MOS's actually have? How much of it is pre-set by higher echelons and just given to the troops in a \"plug and play\" concept? Lastly would SOT-A and JCU folks have this kind of experience?\n\nEdit to Add: Any 35 series guys/gals have this experience in a way that wouldn't require the TS/SCI/SSBI clearance? I think that'd be worth too much$$$ for a role like this, but doesn't hurt to ask.\n\n**Final Edit**: Gonna talk to the CEO tomorrow about a higher starting salary. Thanks for the input, gang.",

    "text": "I'm 26, about to ETS in a couple months. I have about 20k in credit card debt and about 18k in my TSP currently. Credit cards are at 17% interest. I have an accepted job offer for a position that will pay me enough to easily contribute the max matched amount of 6% of my salary (3% matched $ to $, remaining 3% matched $.60 to $) in a traditional or roth 401k. So I'm betting I could make up any amount in from my TSP in less than a few years.\n\nIf I'm understanding the early withdrawal tax correctly, I will have to pay an additional 10% penalty tax, so up to $1,800 depending on how much I pull out when I leave federal service. In my head, that's still better than that amount in cc debt at 17%. Or, right now, I can take out a 10k loan on my balance with an interest rate of 4.25% with no penalties on paying it off early and put it all toward my cc balance.\n\nDo any of these sound like decent options? Am I dumb for even thinking about touching my TSP? I've made a few lifestyle changes and haven't touched my credit cards in two years so I trust myself.\n\nI'll have two spicy McChickens and a time machine that lets me counsel my younger self on better financial decisions.

    "text": "Staff weenies and degenerates, I earnestly have to ask, WHAT is the point of the SDDC? Or rather, every SDDC unit that is related to maritime activities. Don’t get me wrong, I know what their mission is on paper, but as an outsider looking in, I earnestly do not understand how they can rationalize their existence.\n\nThe management of maritime transportation is a critical function of any military. It is an absolute must the military be able to control and manage the movement of goods in a theatre. The SDDC folks (TSBs, ETOEs, DDSBs, RPOEs, etc) will tell you they are super critical, but then when you take a look at their idea of work closely, the lines start to crack. Why pay stevedores 10x the salary of an E2, and deal with labor and unions when the same labor can be performed by an ICTC or SPOC for a fraction of the cost? Why are there so many contractors on the DDSBs staff (who fuck right off to the nearest beach at 1400 daily), when you have TTBNs who are designed to have a full staff to manage fixed and improvised ports? \n\nEvery Soldier I’ve met in the SDDC loves it because:\n1.) TDA means for any mission they are put into fancy hotels.\n2.) Fuck all work is performed by them and instead by contractors. \n3.) These units are loaded with funding due to the criticality of their “mission” the good contractors perform for them.\n\nI genuinely think the SDDC is one of the largest wastes of tax payer money that exist within the modern military. In my opinion, the Army should abolish every unit in the SDDC that performs maritime management, and instead replace them with TB(X)’s, TTBN’s, and SPOC/ICTCs. \n\nBefore anyone chimes in “Well, ashtually, TB(X)’s are made to manage JLOTS and strictly military operations,” no they are not. They are designed to run both fixed and improvised ports, please let them do their job, instead of one half of it because the SDDC needs to rationalize their existence. \n\n- Signed, a MTOE maritime staff weenie trying to rationalize their existence.\n\nOh yeah sorry, I’ll take two Chicago dogs and a an order of chilli fries.

For now, should I do what I’m doing and just tune out the stress and apply for jobs, push for promotion so I get a little more cash and look even better on resume, or quit this stressful job and do something chill for same or better money so I’m not all stressed while job hunting?**\n\nI’m working for $16/hr as shift manager for a retail store. I’m a veteran with a Master’s degree I got on the GI Bill, 20+ years of work experience that’s mainly managerial, proficient in three languages.\n\nI had a major mental health setback over five years ago related to my combat service (no involuntary commitment or criminal record, just iffy credit and several years of resume gap). I was un/underemployed for years and took this job just to avoid total poverty. Been here two years, with a 30¢ raise last year. Boss said I’m getting a “better than usual” raise next month and they want to get me Assistant Manager (which I was also told a year ago).\n\nI’ve struggled to focus enough to apply for jobs, and all the work stress doesn’t help because I’m regularly getting called in to cover shifts. I did a couple years ago get focused and apply for lots of jobs and most of the ones that interviewed me were $80k-140k annually. This year I’ve only applied for a few dozen but had a couple really good interviews for around $80k jobs that I’d really enjoy.\n\nThe current retail job is *way* more responsibility and stress than is remotely reasonable for $16/hr. Most of my coworkers are teens, have only a GED, and/or criminal records. Should I:\n\n* just try to tune the stress out and do the minimum and try harder to apply for good jobs? Part of me wants to not make waves so I have 2+ years at my current job on the resume as I apply elsewhere.\n* work extra hard and get Assistant Manager for a little more money and to look good on the resume? And maybe ask them for a clear timeline on getting my own store (about $70k/yr) in case I just never find something better? Maybe even tell them “if I’m not Assistant Manager by 1 Jan, I’ll be sending out resumes”\n* just quit after my 2 year mark and work anything more chill and enjoyable (say bartending or front desk at a museum) so going into the new year I can have less stress and distraction for a job search for a job with a higher salary and more fitting work for my background? But then my resume would show 2 years of retail manager and then say three months of bartender, and with my resume being patchy over the last eight years I’m worried a recent change looks bad.",

Long lonh long story short, he is in a nursing home with physical ailments and what I will call \"dementia\". Lots of confusion, mixed up memories, short term issues, that sorr of thing. We are paying 11k a month for the care, which has been outstanding by the way. I am his POA and have been working non stop since April on many many fronts on his and Mom's behalf. \n\nI applied on his behalf for VA benefits (hard copy, Dad's ID me doesnt work) hoping there was a trickle of benefits to help us pay for this new financial burden. A couple of weeks go by and I get a call from the VA. Dad is in Priority Group 5. He does not have a combat service record, or a combat injury. The VA rep explained that due to his salary (Lets call is $50k per year, pension and SS) he would not qualify, or **I \"think\" thats what he told me**. I was trying to take notes and understand all he was throwing at me. He explained the Priority groups, and gave me some additional resources to consider. \n\nSecond guessing what I heard, I looked into the PG's and there is an income tool you can use to generate possible benefits. That takes you right on to the form we already submitted 10-10ez. Here is what that form claims we might be eleigible for: \n\n* Free VA health care for most types of care (like primary care, outpatient specialty care, and inpatient hospital care)\n* Prescription medicines with copays\n\nIs this correct with what the VA rep told me? I take it from the above he would not qualify for Nusing home assistance. I sent a follow up to the VA rep, but no word back. Thought I would post amongst us non government folks as I dont speak their language. \n\nThanks for reading my post. Bear with my ignorance and confusion. ",

I’ve been rated with the VA at the max VA amount and permanent since last fall, and a few months prior I started a new job with the DOI. Also, it took me about 20 years to do my last claim for MST. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. \n\nSo at this new job, at first, I was hopeful — a fresh start after leaving a toxic work environment. But lately, I’ve been overwhelmed by constant changes, shifting administration priorities, and the loss of supportive coworkers. I have one left and we’ve become close. However, more and more responsibilities are being placed on me, and it’s really ramping up my anxiety.\n\nI left my last job because of a toxic leader, but now I feel like the chronic stress, unpredictability, and pressure here are triggering my PTSD just as badly — only in a different way. I'm also beginning to realize that regular 9–5 jobs may not be a sustainable path for me. I’ve bounced around jobs a lot, and I’m finally connecting the dots: the structure and stress of traditional work environments just don’t mesh well with how I need to live to stay healthy.\n\nI’ve been seriously considering resigning. I’m was hoping to get RIF’d but nothing has happened yet but we are hearing it’s coming. I’d rather walk away with a severance. \n\nMy spouse fully supports me resigning and thinks I’d be much happier if I did. I have a small side business I’ve wanted to pursue full time — something I could build on my own terms. Financially, I’d be okay. I’ve been living modestly off my GS-12 salary and saving my VA benefits, so the loss of income, while not ideal, isn’t catastrophic.\n\nBut it’s still scary. Giving up the GS-12 pay, the job security, and facing the unknowns — especially with the state of the country right now — is weighing heavily on me.\n\nHas anyone else been in a similar position?

    "text": "Kind of a weird situation. Immediately after getting out I landed into what was supposed to be a short contracting gig, where I heard about VR&amp;E. I was upfront with them about being employed but was able to be approved due to the nature of work being uncertain long term. \n\nNow I’ve finished my degree and they’re asking for additional information about where I’m currently employed, which happens to be the same place due to the contract being extended. \n\nI just want a sanity check - is there any type of risk to acknowledging that I’ve been employed in the field this whole time? Specifically asking because they want my wages, which have been very good for my line of work - to the point that I’m less than fully comfortable disclosing my salary. \n\nAdditionally, they say I’ll still rate EAA even if I’m already employed full time in my target career? Does that track? I’ve seen other posts where people get it while still looking for another job, but if I’m already happy where I am then is that still on the table? \n\nSeems too good to be true and I don’t want to risk triggering some flag that makes them want to recoup the benefits I’ve already received. The degree will absolutely help if this job ever goes away, but I have no intention of searching for another job while my current one is still available. ",

    "title": "How do individual combatants handle their factions' ever shifting alliances, and having to ally with former enemies and fight against former allies?",
    "text": "While researching the First and Second Liberian Civil Wars, one aspect that caught my attention was those two wars were the epitome of \"warlord playgrounds.\" Each faction involved was caught up fighting multiple fronts, and were too entangled in their own theaters to capitalize on their enemies' distractions.\n\nFor example, the primary rebel group NPFL in the first civil war was fighting ULIMO-K in one region, ULIMO-J in another, the ironically misnamed Liberian Peace Council (who was responsible for some of the most horrific atrocities in a war that was essentially a \"war crime contest\" spectacle) in yet another, and a myriad of regional militias and minor NPFL dissident factions in others. Likewise, ULIMO-K found itself fighting its sister splinter faction ULIMO-J in one theater, the NPFL in another, and the Lofa Defense Forces in a third front. Lastly, ULIMO-J was battling both ULIMO-K and the NPFL while simultaneously dealing with its own bouts of inter-factional fighting.\n\nThe warring parties also were very fluid and fragile, and were essentially a tangled web of loose alliances. They had a tendency to confederate and balkanize on a whim, and alliances shifted almost on a flip of a coin. On one month, two factions would be allies against a common rival. In the next month, the factions then switch into becoming bitter enemies, while one of them aligns with their former common opponent against their estranged \"ally.\"\n\nAs a more specific example, ULIMO split into two bitterly competing factions ULIMO-J and ULIMO-K early on in the war's midpoint, and spent as much time fighting each other as their main enemy NPFL. In the war's latter stages, ULIMO-J had an internal power struggle that turned bloody. Which gave the then newly formed NPFL and ULIMO-K alliance a pretense to attack ULIMO-J leaders in Monrovia for \"murder charges.\"\n\nThe Sierra Leone Civil War, the conjoined twin of the two Liberian Civil Wars, also had similarly blurred allegiances. One of the most crippling issues the Sierra Leone government faced with the fighting the NPFL allied RUF insurgents was the extreme neglect of its Sierra Leone Army (SLA) regular military. An overwhelming majority of SLA units were stiffed of rations, equipment, and salaries by their superiors.\n\nTo compensate for the lack of pay checks and supplies, thousands of SLA soldiers shedded their uniforms at night and joined RUF rebels in their pillaging sprees, and then retreated back to their posts in the morning. From these literally nightly back and forth defections, the RUF rebels got a hold of a massive stockpile of SLA weapons and uniforms.\n\nWith the systematic backsliding of allegiances, the SLA and RUF almost completely merged with one another. The SLA also disintegrated into a loose collection of gangs from the lack of cohesion and discipline. Rouge SLA units, nicknamed \"sobels\" by the civilian population, were very prone to fighting \"civil wars within a civil war\" with pro-government tribal militias and other rival SLA units. During the Sierra Leone Civil War's midpoint, a sizable faction of SLA dissenters assisted the RUF rebels in their capture of Freetown before they were driven out by the Nigerian army and government loyalists.\n\nThis overall made the Liberian and Sierra Leone Civil Wars a very confusing mess for me to study in depth. Alliances in civil wars such as Bosnia, Afghanistan, Myanmar, Syria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo were also difficult to research for similar reasons.\n\nHow does your average combatant in these sorts of wars deal with ever changing alliances, and having to fight against former allies alongside former enemies?",

    "title": "Should I base my civilian salary expectations on RMC instead of base pay when leaving the military?",
    "text": "The military provides a Regular Military Compensation (RMC) calculator that factors in base pay, housing, allowances, and other benefits. For example, if my base pay is $70,000, my RMC might be closer to $116,000 when everything is factored.\n\nSince this total RMC reflects what it actually costs to maintain my lifestyle in the military, should I be looking for civilian jobs that pay closer to that $116,000 rather than just my base pay? I feel like if I only aimed for jobs around my base pay, I’d take a big hit financially since the military covers so many extra expenses.\n\nFor those who have transitioned out, how did you approach this? Did you target jobs that matched your RMC, or did you adjust your expectations in some way? Any advice would be appreciated!",

    "text": "Hey everyone,\nI’m 23M and just recently got out of the military after 5 years active duty (logistics). Since getting out, I’ve been focusing on real estate — I currently own 6 rental properties and my long-term goal is to own my own apartment complexes and eventually start a property management/development company.\n\nRight now I’m trying to pick a job that’ll help me reach that goal faster. I want to make more money to keep investing and hopefully scale to 20–25 units in the next 3–5 years before 1031-exchanging into apartments.\n\nHere are my 3 options:\n\n1. GS-12 Government Job (Logistics)\n\t•\t~$92k/year\n\t•\t8–4 schedule, weekends and holidays off\n\t•\tVery stable (annual cost-of-living and step increases)\n\t•\tDownside: I did almost the same thing in the military and hated it — that’s why I got out after 5 years. The only benefit is the stability and consistent paycheck.\n\n2. Property Manager – 200+ Unit New Construction Complex\n\t•\t~$70k/year\n\t•\tSalary, sometimes weekends/overtime\n\t•\tIncludes a real estate license (can sell homes on the side for extra income)\n\t•\tI’d be working directly with the owner/developer — great networking and learning opportunity\n\t•\tThere’s also room to move up in the company: potentially into a District Manager or even VP of Property Management role overseeing multiple complexes\n\t•\tThis job is much more aligned with my long-term goals in real estate\n\n3. Maintenance Supervisor – Same Company\n\t•\t~$70k/year\n\t•\tOverseeing maintenance teams across 1,000+ units\n\t•\tDoesn’t include a real estate license\n\t•\tStill in property management but less aligned with my end goals\n\nAll three have pros and cons — one’s stable but boring, the others are more in line with what I love but come with more risk and less pay up front.\n\nIf your long-term dream was to own and manage apartment complexes, which route would you take?\nWould you go for the stability (GS job) to fund investing faster, or get into the property management world to build experience, network, and move up?\n\nAppreciate any insight — especially from anyone who’s transitioned from the military or scaled up from single-family rentals into apartments.",
