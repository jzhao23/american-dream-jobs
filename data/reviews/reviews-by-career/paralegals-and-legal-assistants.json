    "title": "Mother \"Doesn't Recall\" the 2 Decades her Son was in Prison",
    "text": "Since everyone seemed to enjoy my last post about the awesome response (basically a smoking gun) I got from my subpoena to Disney, I thought I'd share my all-time favorite paralegal story.\n\nThe circumstances were tragic: a homeless man, mid-40's, was hit by our Insured and killed. Insured swore up and down he jumped in front of her car at the last minute and, honestly, I believe her. However, she had been convicted in the past for perjury (it was bad, made the news and everything), so we did NOT want to put her on the stand at trial. Clearly, no jury would believe her. \n\nDecedent's mother filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and her granddaughter. The adjuster did a claims search and a basic background search and even used the in-house investigator to do a cursory search, but didn't find anything, so it looked like this was going to be a pretty bad case - a wrongful death suit where the driver had a high limit policy plus an umbrella policy.  I'm fortunate enough that my firm will NOT take cases where we feel it would be unethical to pursue - like if the Insured had been drinking, we'd tell the adjuster to either pay out or find another law firm. But the adjuster came to us and said something about this case \"just seemed fishy\" so he wanted to proceed with litigation, at least through discovery. Investigate? Sure, my favorite! \n\nFirst weird thing was the fact that the Deceased's mother (Plaintiff) filed this suit on behalf of herself and her granddaughter - but the mother of the daughter wasn't involved and wouldn't give permission for us to depose her minor daughter (a preteen, so not that young). But the Complaint alleged as damage the loss of a father figure, role model, and filial support - were we just supposed to accept that without evidence? But we just figured that's a problem for another day. So just a little weird, not a red flag or anything. \n\nSecond part that was also a little weird (though less so) was how I couldn't seem to find any criminal records for the Decedent. Not to be judgmental or anything, but he was homeless for over 2.5 years and it just seemed odd that he was capable of working and earning a living so he could afford a home but just ...didn't?  And I really believed he jumped in front of the car, so I thought he might've been high on drugs. I send FOIA to the Sheriff's Dept for that county as well as the surrounding ones, and I got back nearly 500 pages - but it was mostly incidental things relating to homeless camps, asking him about other crimes that happened in the camps, a few trespasses issued, and offering him rehab - and no arrests. So, seemed a bit odd but more like \"it is what it is\" sort of thing. \n\nThen we get back Plaintiff's answers to interrogatories - we ask the standard model questions, so of course one of them asked if the Decedent had ever been convicted of a crime. Her exact response: \"Not that I recall.\" Verified and under oath. \n\nI don't know why, but that phrasing seemed fishy to me. As was the fact that she \"couldn't recall\" his exact address prior to him moving down to this state nearly 3 years ago. Attorney said she'd ask about it at Plaintiff's depo the following week, but it just irked me, ya know? Why phrase it that way? Why not say just 'yes, he was arrested,' or 'no, he wasn't'? \n\nSo I started investigating - I call it \"going down a rabbit hole,\" where I suddenly look at the clock, realize I spent the last few hours or half a day on following less than a lead, when I should've been dealing with the million responses and filings and other stuff I have to do. So I wasn't expecting to find much, and the only \"leads\" I had was the death certificate listing his father being back up north, as well as listing the city where he was born. State and county courts don't bring up a single case, and I wasted more time trying the surrounding states and counties with no success, and that's normally when I would've given up. But for kicks, I started googling the Deceased's name, including variations, with those locations and up come a few articles from 1998-ish (one was literally AOL News, these were very archived) about a guy with a similar name (think \"Jon\" instead of \"Jonathan\" or \"Will\" instead of \"William\") *robbing a bank and leading the police on a high-speed chase*. \n\nThere's no way that's the same guy, right? I mean, the adjuster would've found this - right? RIGHT?!\n\nSo now I know to look at federal cases! I hop on PACER, find the right district, type in his last name, first initial, and DOB, and WOWZA! \n\nTurns out, he was convicted of armed robbery in 2000-ish, sentenced to 20 years, paroled after serving 12, at which point he kidnapped a minor, brought her over state lines, made terroristic threats, and committed assault and battery. Because it involved state lines, it was again federal and they ultimately didn't even pursue most of these new, additional charges in exchange for him having to serve the remaining years on his 20 year original sentence - no parole, no early release. So when he got out, he had no probation and that's when he decided to leave the state and move to our state. (Also based on this timeline, his daughter was clearly conceived during that crime spree - so I'm not sure, but can guess why his daughter's mother didn't want to be involved in the lawsuit. Probably also the reason they didn't pursue the new charges, to avoid her testifying as a victim - but again, I'm just speculating.) \n\nI immediately sent an FOIA request to the prison he served at and while I couldn't get most of what I wanted without a subpoena, I did get the correspondence log, showing who he got letters and packages from.  Guess who wrote her son *EVERY SINGLE WEEK* for those 20 years (minus the brief time he was out and on a crime spree)? \n\nThe depo, according to my attorney, started off with her asking the Plaintiff multiple times if she was sure her son had never been arrested. \"I don't recall.\" She confirmed that a mother would remember that sort of thing though, right? Like if she were to write someone, especially a son, in prison, she'd remember writing the letter, addressing an envelope, stamping it, and putting it in the mail to go to a state or federal prison, right? \"I guess.\" What if there were multiple letters? That would be more memorable, right? \"I guess so, but I don't recall doing that.\" \n\nAt which point, my attorney apparently pulled up on screen the correspondence log and - while scrolling through page after page after page - said something along the lines of, \"You don't remember writing your son every single week, plus each holiday, every year FOR TWENTY YEARS?! That's about 55 times a year, or approximately 1,100 times. You don't remember sending 1,100 cards and letters to your own son, addressed to a federal prison? And remember, you ARE under oath.\" \n\nHer attorney immediately called for a break, so there was no response to that question. When the depo resumed, he objected to the correspondence log being introduced as evidence. Attorney continued, saying a judge would rule on it later, and went thru it, wanting to know why there were no letters or correspondence from his daughter? After threatening to get phone records and visitation logs, Plaintiff admitted granddaughter never once saw or communicated with her dad while he was locked up. \"So after, when he moved to an entirely new state, how often did she see him?\" Well, apparently they called and FaceTimed - but she couldn't provide when, how frequently, or any proof he ever paid a cent of child support or other contribution to the child. After stating we'd subpoena phone records, Plaintiff admitted she never saw them talk on the phone or saw them FaceTime, nor is she sure her son had an iPhone, but \"she's sure\" they had \"some sort of relationship.\" Attorney asked for evidence and I was literally drafting a new Request for Production as this was going on, requesting a lot of the above, that was filed immediately after the deposition. (Edit to add: Plaintiff moved to our state in the early 90's, and of course media coverage from then isn't archived as well as it is today, so in the 5 days from when we discovered his criminal history and when her depo was held, we couldn't prove she was in court at the sentencing or trial or anything. I'm sure we could see if she spoke at sentencing, but that turned out to be unnecessary). \n\nCase was settled the next day - for one tenth of the main policy limits, the majority to be held in a trust for the granddaughter (that was our condition and apparently this got some push back from Plaintiff, but her own attorney seemed like he wasn't going to put up his client anymore). Adjuster was thrilled but also impressed that our office found this information that neither he nor their background investigator did. Kept asking, \"how did you know to dig in that small county in a state 1,000 miles away?\" Well, I didn't. It was literally just the way she answered that single interrogatory, \"Not that I recall,\" that was the only thing that seemed odd. In conjunction with all the other things, yeah, it makes sense in hindsight - why he didn't have a LOCAL criminal record, why we couldn't depose the daughter or daughter's mother, even why he was homeless (since it's hard for felons to be employed), but those things individually weren't suspicious. \n\nI just can't believe a mother wouldn't \"recall\" if her only child was ever arrested. \n\nI still go down rabbits holes, but they've never been as successful as this one. Lemme know if you want more stories like these, it's cases like this one that make me love my job! ",

    "text": "Insurance defense paralegal here; I get to do a lot of investigating that I enjoy. Recent case is a guy who fell getting out of his truck - nothing slippery, so I'm not sure how we're liable, but he fell on his back and fractured a vertebrae. \n\nSuit alleges lost wages, loss of ability to earn, etc. One of his \"main\" damages alleged is the fact that he (purportedly) gained a lot of weight while recovering due to his inability to work out and had to get rid of his cosplay costumes, some that were custom-made and expensive. But all together, his medical bills - without write offs, adjustments, insurance or PIP payments, just boardables - totaled about $50K. We have no proof of income let alone lost wages, so when we went to mediation last month, so we made what I thought was a very reasonable opening offer at mediation of more than that. \n\nAlso, as icky as it made me feel, we did a chart of Plaintiff's weight over the past 15 years, basically proving he gained a ton of weight during the pandemic and as of the time of his most recent doctor appointment earlier this year, he was only 8 pounds heavier than he was in the DOL. (At his deposition, he was only 10 pounds heavier, so this rebuttal to his claim shouldn't have been surprising.) So basically, we didn't include \"loss of costumes\" (that he never gave receipts for) in our damage assessment. \n\nMediation didn't even last an hour. Plaintiff and his attorney won't come off their 7-digit demand. (Yes, they want over a million dollars for this fall.) So I guess we're going to trial. \n\nHere's where the fun part (for me) comes in - I figured if he has all these cosplay costumes (most having to do with a galaxy far, far away) and given that we live in a state known for a certain mouse, I went on hunch he might be a pass holder and sent Disney a subpoena. \n\nWell, they delivered - not only providing every time Plaintiff went to any of their parks, and that he never once rented a wheelchair or requested accommodations, but also tons of photos! Including photos of Plaintiff on ALL the roller coasters and rides! Any time he went on something and didn't buy the photo at the end of the ride? Those were apparently all kept and provided to me today, dozens and dozens, all in glorious HD that will be fantastic to blow-up as a trial exhibit for a jury to see. \n\nImagine needing a million dollars for your \"crippling\" back pain, but well enough to go to theme parks and ride roller coasters! 🎢 ",

    "text": "Hi just needing to vent. I’m the only litigation assistant/paralegal, and of course the attorney had a sudden family “emergency” trip right when 8 discovery responses were due.\n\nShe obviously waited until the very last day to serve them, because why not live on the edge? Opposing counsel maxed out interrogatories, production, and admissions for all of them. \n\nFinal drafts? Got them 8 hours before the 5pm deadline. Final documents to compile? A generous 4 hours before. Add 20+ emails of cryptic instructions like, “Add that doc, no wait — remove it. But also keep it. And format it like I didn’t tell you.” She CC’d the office manager and another secretary to “help” but both were too hesitant because the emails were too confusing.\n\nI somehow managed to finalize everything 30 minutes before the deadline. But did I get the green light to print and serve? Not until 4:55pm. Her words: “Serve this ASAP, I want to meet the 5pm deadline.” Sure! Let me just teleport 8 responses and hundreds of exhibits in 5 minutes.\n\nI served the last set at 5:45pm and I am so thankful electronic service.\n\nThe next day, I sent an email saying this deadline was not realistically doable, even with help (which no one felt comfortable giving because no one knew the case). I kindly asked to be given materials earlier next time. You know, basic expectations and consideration of my time and anyone else in the office that would be forced to help.\n\nFour days later, I get this response:\n“There was no way I could’ve gotten these to you earlier. The clients and I did the hard part. All you had to do was format and compile. That’s the easy part. Did you even ask for help? The 5pm deadline wasn’t met, which leads me to believe you didn’t ask for help.”\n\nJust formatting and compiling…Like it’s a five-minute arts &amp; crafts project where I cut, copy, and paste. This from the same person who doesn’t know how to convert a PDF to Word, search inside a PDF, or know how to send a Zoom invitation. \n\nSo after years of being dismissed, gaslit, and blamed — I’m finally submitting my resignation Monday. I’m sure she’ll have no trouble finding someone else to do such an “easy” job.\n",

    "text": "So I went in for my first day and the person to train me works remotely. They came in and showed me a few things. My computer applications weren’t all running. I was given a task by the head of the firm before I started training. Because my computer didn’t work all the way the boss’s son who is an attorney took over and completed the work then sealed it and handed me everything and sent me to drop it off. Later I was telling the trainer what I worked on and she checked it to find that the address of the client wasn’t included in the document. She knew i didn’t prepare it and told me not to worry. I left for lunch and told my trainer when I left and when I got back. At the time the attorney was in a meeting so I didn’t want to disturb him over my meal. I got back from lunch and the boss kinda yelled at me saying next time I need to tell him I’m leaving before i go. I told him I didn’t want to bother him during his meeting and I notified the trainer. He then ask about the task he gave me and I told him what happened he then tried to blame me but his son prepared it I just dropped it off. The trainer then tells me that she expects me to clean the office, take out trash, clean the coffee pot and kitchen, water plants, wipe down. I didn’t apply to learn to clean when there’s so much paperwork to get through. He then tells the trainer that she need to make a code for the door so that he can know when anyone gets in the office and he doesn’t want everyone using his code. She’s never had that request for her previous paralegals and thought it was weird. As I was leaving the office he ask about my family where I’m from, if the people I live with work, if I live with my parents and my age. He then says that I can take anything and he can pick up bananas for me. I declined. Anyway I think it’s worth mentioning that I’m the only black person in the office, he’s Jewish and this was in Downtown Brooklyn. I would drop the name of his practice but too much. I will be turning in the keys in the morning with a set of bananas since he expressed such joy over it. I’m disappointed because I bust my butt to keep up my gpa and prep for law-school.

    "title": "My Client Died.",
    "text": "I’ve been in civil law my entire career (20 something years). It wasn’t until 2023 that I got into personal injury. Specifically, premises liability. I didn’t realize how taxing this work is mentally. Especially when you connect with clients. Particularly the clients who represent estates. It’s hard. \n\nToday was my third time in 19 months that I had to step out and take a walk. The quick version is, we have a client who was sickly, particularly with diabetes. The client had an injury that caused amputations, so it was a decent sized case. Defense settled out of court for a large 6 figure sum. The problem here is the client’s treatment was through the VA. And I don’t know if anyone has experience in trying to get a VA lien, but the process is ENDLESS. \n\nIt took exactly 10 months to get the lien. From\nOctober through January, my client and their spouse were living out of their car, just hoping and waiting for their settlement. They called me every day. And not in an annoying “I want my money” way. They were always so kind, so pleasant. But my client was always so sick. I wanted to help them badly but waiting on the VA lien tied my hands. In that time, they called me crying pretty often. It was heartbreaking. \n\nI finally was able to make the call in January. WE GOT THE LIEN! They were so happy. I expedited the entire process to get them their check. It was a victory moment not just for them, but for me too. I didn’t live through their struggles but I was sympathetic to my daily conversations with them. They are good people who deserved a place to sleep at night. \n\nToday, one month after I sent them their settlement money, my client’s spouse called me to tell me our client passed away this past weekend. I am devastated. Our client spent the last few months of life struggling to survive (and I don’t mean the illnesses) and when they finally get the means to have a sustainable life, our client died. \n\nMy heart is absolutely broken for the both of them. Our client wasn’t elderly, but she was sickly. I know how to put a wall up, and prevent myself from being emotionally invested in clients, but this one really hurts. \n\nThanks for letting me get this out. ",

    "text": "Rant and warning!\nDO NOT WORK AT THIS COMPANY ESPECIALLY IF YOU ALREADY STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH.\n\nFor context: Morgan and Morgan hired me during a really dark time in my life. I had almost lost my battle to mental health and spent a year unemployed. I thought this job would be my fresh start and I was so excited to start my legal career. The interview process was easy… a little too easy now I see why. Not that I wasn’t capable of the job… I just remember the interview being less than 5 minutes and honestly not my best performance. I didn’t even think I would get the job but a few hours later I get a call offering me the job. I remember thinking wow this is my second chance at life. I was hired as a case manager in training but was quickly promoted to case manager meaning I was responsible for managing my own cases from intake to settlement. That should have been the first red flag. Getting promoted despite being at the company for less than 6 months. I also noticed people abruptly leaving and putting in their 2 weeks. I have never seen a company with such a TERRIBLE turnover rate. It’s insane to watch in real time. I can estimate that at LEAST 15 people have left the company since I’ve been here. Attorneys, paralegals, case managers, receptionists etc, have just quit on the fly. The whole company is just disgusting. It has taken such a toll on my mental. Lately, I have been calling out so frequently simply due to anxiety So many factors  like the work environment, the angry clients that curse you out daily, the toxic coworkers who legit gossip like little high schoolers, HR, bitchy supervisors. It’s so fucking exhausting putting on that damn mask every single day. Saying we are “For the People” is comical. The company doesn’t care about their clients or their employees. My clients have gone through several case managers and feel dismissed. Their feelings are valid. We are swamped with so many case because we hire ANYONE. The case load is ridiculous considering we have to do EVERYTHING from intake to settlement. We even have to negotiate with the adjusters wtf is that. I’m not a lawyer ( sorry I’m just ranting at this point lol). They expect you to do 300 jobs while simultaneously communicating with belligerent clients daily. The company doesn’t care about their clients unless they are significantly injured and there’s a good insurance coverage to go after. So many clients slip through the cracks because we are all burnt the fuck out and I do truly feel bad because at the end of the day, these are real people. I can’t give them my undivided attention because I’m fighting for my life as well. I can’t continue to keep living like this. The constant stress and anxiety. Colleagues spreading rumors and digging into your personal life. This is the worst company I’ve ever worked for and I’ve done retail and food service. I know my therapist HATES to see my coming because the majority of our sessions consists of me bitching about how miserable I am at this company. I’ve reached my breaking point and legit just started calling out or going in late. I could very well get fired but that’s how little I care. I’ve been applying to jobs, at this point I’ll take anything. I’m so desperate I’ve applied to jobs where I would take a pay cut. That’s how bad I need to leave. This company legitimately relapsed me into a bad mental state again. At one point,  I even lost 10 pounds from the stress and my mom had noticed. I have already been through enough trauma and this fuck ass job just takes  the cake. On the bright side, I’ve finally woke up and decided I’m not stuck at this company. Truthfully, I stayed for so long because I needed the legal experience. I was afraid I wouldn’t get any callbacks from law firms but I’m slowly starting to hear back from some places. Hopefully I will be able to escape soon. I’m not even sure I respect the company enough to give them a 2 weeks notices. Anyways if you ever get into a car accident. DO NOT GO TO MORGAN AND MORGAN. I wouldn’t accept a job offer from this place unless you are in deep financial trouble and desperately need a job. It’s not worth it. Feel free to dm me with any other questions.

    "title": "Boss cut my salary by 50% after firm lost a client… should I quit or stick it out?",
    "text": "The law firm I work at recently lost a major client, and now my salary is being cut in half.\n\nI’m in my early 20s, and I’ve been working as a paralegal at a very small firm. Most of my work was focused on collections for one of our largest contracts, which brought in a significant amount of revenue for the firm. I have a bachelor’s degree, a paralegal certificate, and about 3 years of legal experience.\n\nI mainly work under one of the attorneys. He has been practicing for decades and basically lives at the office. His wife is also a partner, but she does a different type of law so I rarely interact with her.\n\nLast week, he told me about the client loss and said he would try to keep my salary where it was for the rest of the month. He also recommended I start looking for other jobs and offered to give me a good recommendation.\n\nBut yesterday he said he crunched the numbers and would need to cut me about 40%. When I asked about my health insurance, he realized he hadn’t factored it in, so the cut became over 50%. When I worked it out, the new pay was only a couple of dollars above minimum wage.\n\nI asked him to put this in writing, and he said he would after recalculating everything. For now, I’m working without knowing what my paycheck will actually be. I asked about payroll, since by the time he told me this I had already worked several hours, and he said he had tried to keep me at my current salary for the month. I guess that means he’s not retroactively reducing my pay.\n\nHe said we could try to find other work to supplement my hours, but that’s not stable. Knowing him, he would expect the same level of output even with my salary slashed.\n\nI told him I couldn’t cover my bills with that cut and that I needed to think it over. I mentioned I was considering leaving, and he told me he personally would never walk away from a job. He said employees should stick it out in the trenches together. I used some sick hours to take the rest of the day off to think, and when I explained the situation to my dad, he said that by cutting my “rations,” my boss had already taken me out of the fight.\n\nEveryone I’ve talked to thinks it’s unreasonable to expect me to stay after such a huge cut. I even asked my boss why not just lay me off, and he said he doesn’t like hurting people and that I’ve been the best employee he’s had in years. That part is true. When I started, I had to teach myself everything and fix existing issues on my own. But to me, it hurts more not being able to pay my bills.\n\nSo here’s my dilemma. Do I make today my last day and accept a confirmed temp position that pays more? Or do I try to stick it out until the end of the month for the sake of my resume and a potential recommendation letter I could use for law school?\n\nTLDR: Small law firm lost a client, boss is cutting my salary by more than 50% (to barely above minimum wage). I can’t pay my bills like this. He wants me to “stick it out,” but I have another job lined up that pays more. Should I leave now or stay until the end of the month for the sake of my resume and recommendation?\n\nEDIT: I am the ONLY employee at the firm. The temp job is a restaurant job. I have been applying to other jobs, but I have worked at this firm for under a year, and the previous job I worked at was under a year as well (I moved states). So future employers/recruiters look at all the short stints on my resume and question my potential loyalty to their firm.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI had my meeting with him today and told him it was going to be my last day. We left on good terms and he will still be writing me my letter of recommendation. Thank y’all so much for your thoughts and recommendations. It helped give me a backbone!",

    "text": "So, I'm just going to say this, even though I know y'all are going to scream at me: \n\n**We need trained** **legal secretaries/legal assistants,** ***as well as*** **paralegals.**  \n\nIn fact, it is my opinion that legal support staff should all start as clerical, doing admin stuff before moving on to more substantive roles.  We used to have a two-tiered system, but everybody wants to be a \"paralegal\" now, because somehow answering the phone or filing is now seen as demeaning.  The problem I see is that few people are trained properly in either role.  So, we get support staff who can't spell, don't know appropriate telephone etiquette, cannot format a formal letter, and worse -- are not aware of the ethical responsibilities inherent in their job. \n\nThis is based on my long experience and career.  Yes, I'm one of those old boomer paralegals that gets so much hate on this sub.  But the thing is, I started as a secretary/receptionist.  Not even a legal one.  I was a member of \"Professional Secretaries Internatonal\" back when there was no stigma attached to being the \"secret\" keeper.  There's really nothing wrong with being a secretary. Then, I decided to become a legal secretary to make more money and I got my first legal job. \n\nNext, in order to improve my skills, I took the Certified Professional Legal Secretary exam.  Let me tell you, that was the hardest test I've ever taken, even including AP exams/college exams etc.  It was an in person, two-day test that covered everything from ethics, tricky judgment calls, document preparation, office accounting, and extensive testing on grammar, punctuation, and spelling.   I really wish everyone who wants to enter the legal support field would start there, and start learning basic office procedure before trying to do legal research or draft pleadings.  \n\nI could tell you about my 35-year career and my other certifications, and my teaching experience, but that's not the point.  Firms are hiring \"paralegals\" who they expect to know everything without further training, and what happens? They get fired quickly.  I know that some firms do have a two-tiered system, but I don't know how common that is.  \n\nI just want better trained, happier paralegals.  Let them start out with a bit less stress, learn and study, and THEN go for the substantive stuff.  \n\nI know my experience may not be everyone's, and my idea unrealistic,  but I just had to vent about it at least once.  If you read the whole thing, thanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n",

The pressure to always be available, even outside work hours, adds another layer of stress.\n\nIf you are a paralegal, do you feel more burned out now than a few years ago? Have firm expectations changed? What do you think law firms could do to actually support their teams?",

    "text": "Yesterday I ended my 30 year career as a paralegal and legal professional. Well I have been training my new replacement for 9 days. Initially I thought she would be a good fit based on what she said she could do. But she lied about her skill level to my boss and was offered the job over the phone. They rushed. But past history with them has revealed a real lack of hiring know how. Well the attitude was defensive, anxious, know it all, unprofessional, petty and a complete waste of my time. She day one said, \"I am not the type to take notes\", day two she got upset at her computer while training and said \"Oh fuck you, I dont mean you.\", day three, her brand new keyboard stops working and she starts smacking the keyboard with her hands. The very next day out internet was down so we mostly sat around doing minimal stuff working of our phone Hotspot. On this day she kept running and and out of the office after I would give her a task to do on her own. My attorney had communicated for me to test her on tasks by herself. Each time she would take instructions she would shut me down, and so then she would hurriedly bring me back incorrect work and then need directions, would complete the work and say I need a five minute break. Come to find out she was running in and out for her vape pen to hit her nicotine. Well, yesterday my last day, the internet was down again so I decided to work from home. Finally,  my IT guy called and said the internet was on so I made my way to the office. The trainee was vaping in the office so much so that I could smell it before I got to the office entrance, all the way through the office and straight into her office (my old office). I walked by and said, \"It smells like vape juice in here. Are you vaping? My sons vape but not inside.\" She immediately closed her door and frantically opened her office windows. I was pissed off and left because I felt it was rude. I know she was scared but I didn't confront her after I left. I just called my boss and told her. But later when I told her that I left because of the smell, she tried to gaslight me and say \"What smell?\". This woman keeps her vape pen on her desk next to her glass of water. I\n\nI am wondering if you have had this kind of experience with employees who vape to this extent. Did your employer allow this at your office? ",

    "text": "I have had the worst time keeping a job since my wife died. I can’t remember a thing, am constantly dissociating, have really mediocre organizational skills, have made lots of mistakes, and have a massive workload (plaintiff’s PI — 150 active lit files). I have learned so much at this firm I’ve been at for half the year now (hoping for just one w-2 this year 🤞🏼 I don’t fuck it up), but one of the attorneys I support really makes things difficult for me and is a condescending jackass when he gives corrections (he used to yell at me but was told to stop, apparently). And since attorneys are fucking god and we are lowly expendables I am always worried about my standing.\n\nHe recently assigned me a flood of tasks at once via email and wanted them all to be done in roughly two or three weeks. He literally called it a “flood of assignments” in his emails. This is all on top of the usual mess of code and court imposed deadlines of course. It has been a real struggle not only to communicate with such an unapproachable person, but to have to explain why his self imposed deadlines are unrealistic. \n\nOne, I’m questioning my ability to do this work. Does anyone else make a lot of mistakes and hate themselves for it? How do you keep from spiraling? \n\nTwo, any other seriously traumatized people struggling with organizational skills and time management? Have any tips to share on how to get on top of things? \n\nThree, anybody have a recommendation on how to deal with the stress in a reasonable, healthy way instead of melting into a puddle of shame and anxiety? \n\nFreeze has been my go to stress response since my wife died.

    "text": "First time in the field, I was hired in about 6 months ago at a specialty personal injury firm. I was still in school, and had just started my final semester in my paralegal program at the community college. They knew I had no experience when they hired me, and seemed eager to train me.\n\nUltimately, the reason I was given for being fired was that the learning curve was steeper than they thought it would be and that they needed someone with more experience. I received maybe 2 days of training, and one of those was with the legal assistant. I was given a bunch of cases and no direction after about a month. I flailed my way through, and sure, my work product could have been better, but they knew I had no experience working in a law firm when I was hired. I was following the directions I was given, and they refused to elaborate on the Bigger Picture when I asked. \n\nI felt my way through the pre-lit process and was starting to feel like I actually understood what we were doing. But I guess they had already given up on me. I saw the writing on the wall, honestly. I was kind of brushed aside. My questions and requests for tasks often went unanswered. I spent much of the past month just twiddling my thumbs. The attorney I worked for would send me emails asking for my thoughts about certain situations, and then would ghost me when I gave him my answers. A month or two ago, they started talking about bringing on another attorney, and then an off-shore paralegal. They both started this week, and I guess it left me as the odd man out. And so I got the Ol' Stanky Boot.\n\nTruthfully, I was getting kind of sick of the job anyway. I realized a couple months into it that we were a settlement mill. Our team got our clients *exclusively* as referrals from Top Dog Law. If you're familiar with Top Dog, you'll know what I mean. I feel that roughly 50% of our clients were trying to scam in one way or another. The majority of the ones I dealt with were non-responsive or incorrigible. It was nearly impossible to get any of them to follow instructions, and especially when I only half-knew what I was talking about.\n\nMy biggest concern is that taking this role may have ruined me and my expectations for where I should be at this stage in my career. The job was by far the best I've ever had after working ~20 years in the service industry. Hybrid schedule, wfh 3 days per week. $55k salary with full health and 15 days PTO. I was quite content to stay here for a couple years and gain some experience while finishing my bachelor's degree. \n\nTruthfully, I was kind of surprised to land such a lucrative role with no experience working in law. It's my intuition that the senior paralegal really pushed for me to get hired, but for her own purposes. I feel like she liked me because I was non-threatening. I am a guy and had no experience. She is a woman who has over 20 years of experience. After interacting with the team for the time I was there, I think she was trying to protect her own status as Queen Bitch of the firm, so to speak (I say this in a positive manner, not a derogatory one. I've got no ill will).\n\nThe CEO fired me because my former attorney is a coward and had him do it while he was out on vacation. He said that both himself and my former attorney were willing to be references on my job search, and offered me some leads if I was interested. He said that my work product was good and that everyone who worked with me only had positive things to say.\n\nShort term, I'll be fine. My partner is amazing and we have been discussing our options. However, I don't know that I can force myself to take another job paying $10-15k less that's going to require me to go into the office 5 days per week. I don't want to have to start over earning my PTO, which probably won't be near as good as it was. It just sucks to have to start over when I was finally settling in.\n\nOk, rant over. I just had to get these thoughts out. Make me feel better? Make me feel worse? Tell me a funny or relatable story? Idk, do what you do, paralegals of Reddit.",

    "text": "Hi paras!\n\nI’m currently working as a paralegal at a large firm in a mid-sized city. I’ve only been there for a little over a year, but I already feel so devalued by the way this firm treats staff. It has disillusioned me with the legal field altogether and crushed my passion for something I once found fascinating. \n\nSo in effort to rekindle my interest in paralegal work, I want to ask this community: is my firm normal in the way it treats staff?\n\nHere are some examples:\n\n- Attorneys have catered lunch every Wednesday that the staff isn’t allowed to have. They all gather and eat together for an hour or so, while we continue working at our desks. But to make matter worse, they let staff into the room after the attorneys have finished eating to choose from whatever the attorneys didn’t eat. A lot of times, there isn’t even any food left over. \n\n- Staff isn’t invited to the annual firm party. We only get invited to smaller functions. \n\n- Staff has to be in-person every day, no exceptions. Attorneys can work remotely. \n\n- Attorneys don’t talk to me unless they are assigning me work. Only a few attorneys have ever asked me about my life (again, this is a large firm). \n\n- I’m not integrated into case teams or made aware of what is going on. One time, I found out that my busiest case had suddenly closed. My case team had known about this for over a week and failed to tell me. I was so hurt because I had worked really hard and done a lot of overtime for that case. \n\nI’ve brought my concerns to management, but they’re always brushed off. It’s starting to make me feel like I’m just difficult or too sensitive. \n\nI’m just looking for hope that this won’t be my life if I continue in this field. I just starting my career as a paralegal, but I already feel so exhausted and hopeless. ",

    "text": "I’ve been a paralegal for an attorney at a small firm in Colorado for 3 years now. I am the only paralegal in the office, so while I mainly work for him, I also do work for the one other attorney in the office. It is also important to note that he is the owner of the firm, so he signs the paychecks, etc.\n\nWithin the office there are 2 attorneys, one file room person, and one secretary.\n\nToday I heard some chatter about the Christmas bonus and how they were distributed. I didn’t find mine in my box like other people, but I didn’t plan to inquire about it because I feel like at a small firm, unless you’re an attorney, bonuses aren’t really expected.\n\nMy boss came into my office and asked to speak with me, and he told me that he distributed the bonuses but that I wouldn’t be getting one (every other person in the office got one). Yeah, I was disappointed but I didn’t think a whole lot of it until he continued on and gave his reasoning as to why. He told me that the reason I wasn’t getting one was because my hours and overtime (I’m hourly, not salary) have been so substantial (I average about 10-12 hrs OT/week) that I have become the highest paid person in the office (excluding attorneys).\n\nThis comment is when I became offended. We have 4 major trials coming up in 2026 and I am the only person doing the “scut” prep in addition to the other paralegal duties I am doing for the smaller clients not going to trial. Earlier in the year when I started prepping, I asked him if he was okay with the hours I was working and weekends I was working, to which he said he was because my research and other work product needed to be done and those things I was working on required mass amounts of time. But now, because of those hours I’m working, I don’t get a bonus. I think at this point it isn’t even about the money, but the fact that his reasoning behind him not giving me one was because of the long and hard hours that I have put in. To twist the knife even more, he ended the conversation by saying that I was “a huge asset and indispensable to the firm.”\n\nI will say, I am applying to law school and he has been a huge help in that process by giving me advice, LORs, and helping me edit my personal statement. I feel like I have sacrificed a lot of my time and energy for this job, and I think I am more hurt by the lack of appreciation for it than I am about the money.\n\nAm I in the wrong for feeling offended? Do you all have any advice as to what I should do?\n\nEDIT: This is the first firm I have worked in as a paralegal, so I’m not really sure the “norm” for paralegals. Prior to this, I worked as a secretary at another law firm for 3 years in which we never got bonuses so I’m not really sure what to do. We also haven’t gotten bonuses at this firm that I’m a paralegal at before and this is the first year he has done them (at least to my knowledge).",

To be one bad day/breakup away from homelessness given these things is incredibly scary and makes me wonder if it’s really worth it to continue in this field. Sure, there’s opportunity for growth from the bottom, but that bottom is so low.\n\nIs this a normal experience? When will the pay get better? Is it just my firm or does everyone just “eat sh*t” and suck it up the first 5 years? I guess I’m just looking for some clarity here on how normal or abnormal this is. Feel free to tell me I’m whining.\n\nEdit: I feel like I need to add — this is a remote job but based in CA and so of course I live here. That was 90% of what convinced me to switch over. It’s an enormous benefit to me, quite honestly.",

    "title": "6 Month Salary Adjustment and Raise",
    "text": "I know this occupation is stressful but I just wanted to share some good news I got last Friday!! \n\nI’m 6 months in at my new firm and I was stressing out. This is my first paralegal job switching from corporate life where everyone is at risk of getting laid off always. Everyone at the firm has been there for a long time, and I felt like I had a bunch to prove. \n\nMy performance review went well, but I try to view raises and bonuses as nice but nothing guaranteed. WELL, Friday I open up an email from the managing partner with a letter attached detailing:\n- 1 time “salary adjustment” of $1,000 because they felt my initial salary was low &amp; wanted to comp for the past 6 months. \n- Additional raise of $4,000 a year, starting with my next paycheck \n\nI’m so hyped!! I don’t know if this is standard or not, but I feel very honored to work at such a firm and it definitely puts the pressure on to keep going :) it’s crazy because I did not negotiate or anything. I think others might have but I’m just relieved that they appreciate my work! ",

    "title": "Salary Range - Too High?",
    "text": "I had an interview yesterday for a position where salary range was not included in the job posting. Typically, I wouldn’t have bothered to apply but I know one of the attorneys there and he told me all the ins and out of the firm and he thinks I would be a good fit. \n\nMoving on, when the managing partner finally asked me of my salary expectations, I tried to turn the question around to ask him what he thinks a starting salary should be for a candidate like me with similar years of experience and qualifications. He didn’t seem to appreciate that question and gave me a non-answer and then asked me again what my range is. \n\nI said between $75,000 to $85,000 because that falls under the market value for this position with someone of my yrs/qualifications. \n\nFor reference (and didn’t tell him this obviously), I am making $68,400.00. I would like to jump to at least 20% so roughly $82,000. But willing to cut down to $79,000 if it comes down to it. I did enough research to know that my expected range is accurate for a paralegal with my experience in my area. \n\nManaging partner didn’t seem to think so and claimed that that’s a high range within their paralegal team. \n\nI asked if that’s in the budget and he seemed offended and said yes but still on the high end. \n\nNot sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, not a complete no. But on the other, if I do receive an offer, I’m worried any raise (requested or annually) wouldn’t be offered in the future.\n\nHave you ever had a situation where someone said your salary range was “high” during an interview? How did you go about it?\n\nEDIT - have 7+ years of civil litigation experience and in New Orleans metropolitan area. ",

    "text": "Short and sweet.  I’m a paralegal with almost 16 year experience. I’m old school and like to stay at my firms for very long times. Anyway, I jumped about 1.5 years ago to work In-house. I took the job because that was my goal.  This job has been the best for my mental health…. Ever.  I love almost everything about the job, but I don’t see that I would ever have a chance to advance. I was contacted by a recruiter for a very interesting job for a newer insurance company.  No litigation, more compliance / research type paralegal job. Anyway, the salary is 38k more than what I make now. I wasn’t looking for a job and I really like my present one….. but the money. It would be putting me up to 110-115k per year plus bonus. What would you do if you got the offer? PTO benefits are comparable. Tech is better. Fully remote. My present job is 97% remote. Also, I wasn’t  extended an offer, however, I’ve made through all the interviews and I’m at the very last step.  I’m afraid to say who I’ll be speaking to, but let’s just say it’s the person in charge of all hires.  \n\nIf I do get the job offer, should I leave my current one just because of the money?  Should I leave to be “at the ground floor” of a new insurance company?  ",

    "text": "So my firm has been going through some rough transitions. I was brought in during September of 2024 as a PI paralegal to become a workers comp paralegal. During the transition, I became the second most senior paralegal and became the go to fix it person despite my still learning. If shit hit the fan, it would hit my desk and I would find a way to fix it or minimize damage, if a file turned into a dumpster fire, i took it from the most senior paralegal. I took over the records department, began handling the liens, became quasi management, took over training new hires (support staff and attorneys alike) and became everyone’s go to. \n\nWell I was moved to salary and I have been working my ass off. This month I have hit 236 hours in billables, i had one day where I ended up working for 24 hours straight and brought in an equal amount of billables. I am the top biller in my firm, including the attorneys. Despite all that I’ve taken on, and the blood, sweat and tears I’ve spilt in an effort to keep this firm up and running, today my managing partner sent out a blast email to all the support staff blasting me because I hadn’t touched one file in 2 months. \n\nI just called my manager and broke down. Because if she had torn me a new one privately, I could at least defend myself, but if I respond to everyone to try and salvage my reputation then I’m breaking hierarchy which is already shaky and might cause another not so good reaction. \n\nEnded up telling my manager they need to find someone new to train people, they have to find another cash cow, and they need to find a fixer because the partner embarrassing me simply for an oversight when I have my hand in nearly every cookie jar in that firm is unacceptable. I was crying because I would have burned myself out to try and save this firm if the partner hadn’t just publicly blasted me. ",
