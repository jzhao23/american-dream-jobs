    "title": "Data Science Has Become a Pseudo-Science",
    "text": "I’ve been working in data science for the last ten years, both in industry and academia, having pursued a master’s and PhD in Europe. My experience in the industry, overall, has been very positive. I’ve had the opportunity to work with brilliant people on exciting, high-impact projects. Of course, there were the usual high-stress situations, nonsense PowerPoints, and impossible deadlines, but the work largely felt meaningful.\n\nHowever, over the past two years or so, it feels like the field has taken a sharp turn. Just yesterday, I attended a technical presentation from the analytics team. The project aimed to identify anomalies in a dataset composed of multiple time series, each containing a clear inflection point. The team’s hypothesis was that these trajectories might indicate entities engaged in some sort of fraud.\n\nThe team claimed to have solved the task using “generative AI”. They didn’t go into methodological details but presented results that, according to them, were amazing. Curious, nespecially since the project was heading toward deployment, i asked about validation, performance metrics, or baseline comparisons. None were presented.\n\nLater, I found out that “generative AI” meant asking ChatGPT to generate a code. The code simply computed the mean of each series before and after the inflection point, then calculated the z-score of the difference. No model evaluation. No metrics. No baselines. Absolutely no model criticism. Just a naive approach, packaged and executed very, very quickly under the label of generative AI.\n\nThe moment I understood the proposed solution, my immediate thought was \"I need to get as far away from this company as possible\". I share this anecdote because it summarizes much of what I’ve witnessed in the field over the past two years. It feels like data science is drifting toward a kind of pseudo-science where we consult a black-box oracle for answers, and questioning its outputs is treated as anti-innovation, while no one really understand how the outputs were generated.\n\nAfter several experiences like this, I’m seriously considering focusing on academia. Working on projects like these is eroding any hope I have in the field. I know this won’t work and yet, the label generative AI seems to make it unquestionable. So I came here to ask if is this experience shared among other DSs?\n\n",

    "title": "My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist",
    "text": "**Background**\n\nI’m a self-taught data scientist, with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist. I’m more math minded than the average person, but I’m not special. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and have worked alongside 6 data scientists, 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters. Despite being probably, the 6th out of 7 in natural ability, I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group.\n\n\n**Gatekeeping**\n\nEvery day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of “what do I need to know to get started in ML/DS?” The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master. As someone who’s been on both sides, this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry. I don’t think you can be bad at math and have no pre-requisite knowledge, and be successful, but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated. Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity.\n\n\n\nAs a mechanical engineering student, I had at least 3 calculus courses, a linear algebra course, and a probability course, but it was 10+ years before I attempted to become a DS, and I didn’t remember much at all. This sub, and others like it, made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist. \n\n\n\nWhen I started my journey, I would take coding, calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc. courses. I’d take a course, do OK in it, and move onto the next thing. However, eventually I’d get defeated because I realized I couldn’t remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior. It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.\n\n\n**What you actually need**\n\nThe reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.\n\n\nFor calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.\n\n\n\nFor stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.\n\n\n\nFor linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to ‘read’ it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.\n\n\n\nFor probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.\n\n\n\nOf all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. \n\n\n\nBy far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to \"frame\" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like \"should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?\" or “which of these algorithms will perform best?”. The answer should usually be, \"I don't know, try it, measure it, and see\". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   \n\n\n\nDespite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. That’s what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.\n\n\n\nThe reason I’m near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies’ data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. I’ve also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. I’d have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. I’m also just aware of more ‘tips and tricks’ than anyone else.  \n\n\n\nGood domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. \n\n\n**Advice for those self taught**\n\n\nI’ve been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.\n\n\n\nI taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.\n\n\nThe first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. \n\n\n\nMy boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. \n\n  \n\nEventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. \n\n\n\nOnce I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didn’t know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.\n\n\n\nAfter 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.\n\n\n\nI'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.\n\n\n**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendy’s.\n\n**Edit:** I’m not saying to never go deeper into things, I’m literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.\n\n\nI thought it went without saying, but I’m not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.\n\n**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic",

Interviews at all the FAANGs are similar. Call with HR rep, first round is with 1 person and might be technical. Then a final round with a bunch of individual interviews on the same day. Most of the questions will be STAR format. \n\n3. As for my skillsets, I advertise myself as someone who can build strategy, project manage, and can do deep dive analyses. I’m never going to compete against the recent grads and experts in ML/LLM/AI on technical skills, that’s just an endless grind to stay at the top.

I also explained what RAG is, and how AI/LLMs work at a high level. I explained to them that AI is a fantastic tool, but I'm not sure if we should be spending 100k a year on it. They also asked if I have built any predictive models. I don't think they quite understood what that was as well, because we don't have the amount of data or need to predict anything.\n\nNeedless to say, they decided it was best not to move forward \"for now\".

Had to push to get the individual made redundant because they were a serious liability. It was so problematic working with them I felt like they were a plant from a competitor trying to sabotage us.\n\nStart hiring a new data scientist very recently. Lots of applicants, some with very impressive CVs, phds, experience etc. I gave a handful of them a very basic take home assessment, and the work I got back was mind boggling. The majority had no idea what they were doing, couldn't merge two data frames properly, didn't even look at the data at all by eye just printed summary stats. I was and still am flabbergasted they have high paying jobs in other places.  They would need major coaching to do basic things in my team. \n\nSo my question is: is there a pool of \"fake\" data scientists out there muddying the job market and ruining our collective reputation, or have I just been really unlucky?",

    "text": "work at a company with around 100 data scientists, ML and data engineers.\n\nThe most frustrating part of working with many data scientists and honestly, I see this on this sub all the time too, is how obsessed some folks are with using ML or whatever the latest SoTA causal inference technique is. Earlier in my career plus during my masters, I was exactly the same, so I get it.\n\nBut here’s the best advice I can give you: **don’t be that person.**\n\nUnless you’re literally working on a product where ML is the core feature, **your job is basically being an internal consultant.** That means understanding what stakeholders actually want, challenging their assumptions when needed, and giving them something useful, not just something that will disappear into a slide deck or notebook. \n\nAlways try and make something run in production, don’t do endless proof of concepts. If you’re doing deep dives / analysis, define success criteria of your initiatives, try and measure them (e.g., some of my less technical but awesome DS colleagues made their career of finding drivers of key KPIs, reporting them to key stakeholders and measuring improvement over time). In short, **prove you’re worth it**.\n\nA lot of the time, that means building a dashboard. Or doing proper data/software engineering. Or using GenAI. Or whatever else some of my colleagues (and a loads of people on this sub) roll their eyes at.\n\nSolve the problem. Use whatever gets the job done, not just whatever looks cool on a résumé.",

    "title": "I have run DS interviews and wow!",
    "text": "Hey all,\nI have been responsible for technical interviews for a Data Scientist position and the experience was quite surprising to me. I thought some of you may appreciate some insights.\n\nA few disclaimers: I have no previous experience running interviews and have had no training at all so I have just gone with my intuition and any input from the hiring manager. As for my own competencies, I do hold a Master’s degree that I only just graduated from and have no full-time work experience, so I went into this with severe imposter syndrome as I do just holding a DS title myself. But after all, as the only data scientist, I was the most qualified for the task.\n\nFor the interviews I was basically just tasked with getting a feeling of the technical skills of the candidates. I decided to write a simple predictive modeling case with no real requirements besides the solution being a notebook. I expected to see some simple solutions that would focus on well-structured modeling and sound generalization. No crazy accuracy or super sophisticated models.\n\nFor all interviews the candidate would run through his/her solution from data being loaded to test accuracy. I would then shoot some questions related to the decisions that were made. This is what stood out to me:\n\n1. Very few candidates really knew of other approaches to sorting out missing values than whatever approach they had taken. They also didn’t really know what the pros/cons are of imputing rather than dropping data. Also, only a single candidate could explain why it is problematic to make the imputation before splitting the data.\n\n2. Very few candidates were familiar with the concept of class imbalance.\n\n3. For encoding of categorical variables, most candidates would either know of label or one-hot and no alternatives, they also didn’t know of any potential drawbacks of either one.\n\n4. Not all candidates were familiar with cross-validation\n\n5. For model training very few candidates could really explain how they made their choice on optimization metric, what exactly it measured, or how different ones could be used for different tasks.\n\nOverall the vast majority of candidates had an extremely superficial understanding of ML fundamentals and didn’t really seem to have any sense for their lack of knowledge.\nI am not entirely sure what went wrong. My guesses are that either the recruiter that sent candidates my way did a poor job with the screening. Perhaps my expectations are just too unrealistic, however I really hope that is not the case. My best guess is that the Data Scientist title is rapidly being diluted to a state where it is perfectly fine to not really know any ML.\nI am not joking - only two candidates could confidently explain all of their decisions to me and demonstrate knowledge of alternative approaches while not leaking data.\n\nWould love to hear some perspectives. Is this a common experience?\n",

    "title": "The \"Unicorn\" is Dead: A Four-Era History of the Data Scientist Role and Why We're All Engineers Now",
    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been in this field for a while now, starting back when \"Big Data\" was the big buzzword, and I've been thinking a lot about how drastically our roles have changed. It feels like the job description for a \"Data Scientist\" has been rewritten three or four times over. The \"unicorn\" we all talked about a decade ago feels like a fossil today.\n\nI wanted to map out this evolution, partly to make sense of it for myself, but also to see if it resonates with your experiences. I see it as four distinct eras.\n\n---\n\n### **Era 1: The BI &amp; Stats Age (The \"Before Times,\" Pre-2010)**\n\nRemember this? Before \"Data Scientist\" was a thing, we were all in our separate corners.\n\n*   **Who we were:** BI Analysts, Statisticians, Database Admins, Quants.\n*   **What we did:** Our world revolved around historical reporting. We lived in SQL, wrestling with relational databases and using tools like Business Objects or good old Excel to build reports. The core question was always, **\"What happened last quarter?\"**\n*   **The \"advanced\" stuff:** If you were a true statistician, maybe you were building logistic regression models in SAS, but that felt very separate from the day-to-day business analytics. It was more academic, less integrated.\n\nThe mindset was purely descriptive. We were the historians of the company's data.\n\n### **Era 2: The Golden Age of the \"Unicorn\" (Roughly 2011-2018)**\n\nThis is when everything changed. *HBR* called our job the \"sexiest\" of the century, and the hype was real.\n\n*   **The trigger:** Hadoop and Spark made \"Big Data\" accessible, and Python with Scikit-learn became an absolute powerhouse. Suddenly, you could do serious modeling on your own machine.\n*   **The mission:** The game changed from \"What happened?\" to **\"What's *going* to happen?\"** We were all building churn models, recommendation engines, and trying to predict the future. The Jupyter Notebook was our kingdom.\n*   **The \"unicorn\" expectation:** This was the peak of the \"full-stack\" ideal. One person was supposed to understand the business, wrangle the data, build the model, and then explain it all in a PowerPoint deck. The *insight* from the model was the final product. It was an incredibly fun, creative, and exploratory time.\n\n### **Era 3: The Industrial Age &amp; The Great Bifurcation (Roughly 2019-2023)**\n\nThis is where, in my opinion, the \"unicorn\" myth started to crack. Companies realized a model sitting in a notebook doesn't actually *do* anything for the business. The focus shifted from *building models* to *deploying systems*.\n\n*   **The trigger:** The cloud matured. AWS, GCP, and Azure became the standard, and the discipline of MLOps was born. The problem wasn't \"can we predict it?\" anymore. It was, **\"Can we serve these predictions reliably to millions of users with low latency?\"**\n*   **The splintering:** The generalist \"Data Scientist\" role started to fracture into specialists because no single person could master it all:\n    *   **ML Engineers:** The software engineers who actually productionized the models.\n    *   **Data Engineers:** The unsung heroes who built the reliable data pipelines with tools like Airflow and dbt.\n    *   **Analytics Engineers:** The new role that owned the data modeling layer for BI.\n*   The mindset became engineering-first. We were building factories, not just artisanal products.\n\n### **Era 4: The Autonomous Age (2023 - Today and Beyond)**\n\nAnd then, everything changed again. The arrival of truly powerful LLMs completely upended the landscape.\n\n*   **The trigger:** ChatGPT went public, GPT-4 was released, and frameworks like LangChain gave us the tools to build on top of this new paradigm.\n*   **The mission:** The core question has evolved again. It's not just about prediction anymore; it's about **action and orchestration**. The question is, **\"How do we build a system that can understand a goal, create a plan, and execute it?\"**\n*   **The new reality:**\n    *   **Prediction becomes a feature, not the product.** An AI *agent* doesn't just predict churn; it takes an *action* to prevent it.\n    *   **We are all systems architects now.** We're not just building a model; we're building an intelligent, multi-step workflow. We're integrating vector databases, multiple APIs, and complex reasoning loops.\n    *   **The engineering rigor from Era 3 is now the mandatory foundation.** You can't build a reliable agent without solid MLOps and real-time data engineering (Kafka, Flink, etc.).\n\nIt feels like the \"science\" part of our job is now less about statistical analysis (AI can do a lot of that for us) and more about the rigorous, empirical science of architecting and evaluating these incredibly complex, often non-deterministic systems.\n\nSo, that's my take. The \"Data Scientist\" title isn't dead, but the \"unicorn\" generalist ideal of 2015 certainly is. We've been pushed to become deeper specialists, and for most of us on the building side, that specialty looks a lot more like engineering than anything else.\n\nCurious to hear if this matches up with what you're all seeing in your roles. Did I miss an era? Is your experience different?\n\nEDIT: In response to comments asking if this was written by AI: The underlying ideas are based on my own experience.\n\nHowever, I want to be transparent that I would not have been able to articulate my vague, intuitive thoughts about the changes in this field with such precision. \n\nI used AI specifically for the structurization and organization of the content.",

    "text": "One of the reasons I wanted to become an AI engineer was because I wanted to do cool and artsy stuff in my free time and automate away the menial tasks. But with the continuous advancements I am finding that it is taking away the fun in doing stuff. The sense of accomplishment I once used to have by doing a task meticulously for 2 hours can now be done by AI in seconds and while it's pretty cool it is also quite demoralising. \n\nThe recent 'ghibli style photo' trend made me wanna vomit, because it's literally nothing but plagiarism and there's nothing novel about it. I used to marvel at the art created by Van Gogh or Picasso and always tried to analyse the thought process that might have gone through their minds when creating such pieces as the Starry night (so much so that it was one of the first style transfer project I did when learning Machine Learning). But the images now generated while fun seems soulless.\n\nAnd the hypocrisy of us using AI for such useless things. Oh my god. It boils my blood thinking about how much energy is being wasted to do some of the stupid stuff via AI, all the while there is continuously increasing energy shortage throughout the world.\n\nAnd the amount of job shortage we are going to have in the near future is going to be insane! Because not only is AI coming for software development, art generation, music composition, etc. It is also going to expedite the already flourishing robotics industry. Case in point look at all the agentic, MCP and self prompting techniques that have come out in the last 6 months itself.\n\nI know that no one can stop progress, and neither should we, but sometimes I dread to imagine the future for not only people like me but the next generation itself. Are we going to need a universal basic income? How is innovation going to be shaped in the future? \n\nApologies for the rant and being a downer but needed to share my thoughts somewhere.\n\nPS: I am learning to create MCP servers right now so I am a big hypocrite myself.

    "text": "**Background**: During my PhD in Data Science at Stanford, I got sick and tired of ghost jobs &amp; 3rd party offshore agencies on LinkedIn &amp; Indeed. So I wrote a script that fetches jobs from 100k+ company websites' career pages and uses GPT4o-mini to extract relevant information (ex salary, remote, etc.) from job descriptions. I made it publicly available here [https://hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe) and you can follow my progress and give me feedback at r/hiringcafe\n\n**Tech details (from a DS perspective)**\n\n1. Verifying legit companies. This I did manually, but it was crucial that I exclude any recruiting firms, 3rd party offshore agencies, etc. I manually sorted through the \\~100,000 company career pages (this took several weeks) and picked the ones that looked legit. At Stanford, we call this technique \"occular regression\" :) \n2. Removing ghost jobs. I discovered that a strong predictor of if a job is a ghost job is that if it keeps being reposted. I was able to identify reposting by doing a embedding text similarity search for jobs from the same company. If 2 job descriptions overlap too much, I only show the date posted for the *earliest* listing. This allowed me to weed out most ghost jobs simply by using a date filter (for example, excluding any jobs posted over a month ago). \n3. Scraping fresh jobs 3x/day. To ensure that my database is reflective of the company career page, I check each company career page 3x/day. To avoid rate-limits, I used a rotating proxy from Oxylabs for now.\n4. Building advanced NLP text filters. After playing with GPT4o-mini API, I realized I could can effectively dump raw job descriptions (in HTML) and ask it to give me back formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to extract a variety of information, including technical keywords, job industry, required licenses &amp; security clearance, if the company sponsors visa, etc.\n\n**Question for the DS community:** Beyond job search, one thing I'm really excited about this 4.1 million job dataset is to be able to do a yearly or quarterly trend report. For instance, to look at what technical skills are growing in demand. What kinds of cool job trends analyses would you do if you had access to this data.\n\n**Edit:** A few folks DMed asking to explore the data for job searching. I put together a minimal frontend to make the scraped jobs searchable: [https://hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe) — note that it's currently non-commercial, unsupported, just a PhD side-project at the moment until I gradute.\n\n**Edit 2::** thank you for all the super positive comments. you can follow my progress on scraping more jobs on r/hiringcafe .Aalso to comments saying this is an ad, my full-time job is my phd, this is just a fun side project beofore I get an actual job haha",

    "title": "What technical skills should young data scientists be learning?",
    "text": "Data science is obviously a broad and ill-defined term, but most DS jobs today fall into one of the following flavors:\n\n- Data analysis (a/b testing, causal inference, experimental design)\n\n- Traditional ML (supervised learning, forecasting, clustering) \n\n- Data engineering (ETL, cloud development, model monitoring, data modeling)\n\n- Applied Science (Deep learning, optimization, Bayesian methods, recommender systems, typically more advanced and niche, requiring doctoral education)\n\nThe notion of a “full stack” data scientist has declined in popularity, and it seems that many entrants into the field need to decide one of the aforementioned areas to specialize in to build a career. \n\nFor instance, a seasoned product DS will be the best candidate for senior product DS roles, but not so much for senior data engineering roles, and vice versa. \n\nSince I find learning and specializing in everything to be infeasible, I am interested in figuring out which of these “paths” will equip one with the most employable skillset, especially given how fast “AI” is changing the landscape. \n\nFor instance, when I talk to my product DS friends, they advise to learn how to develop software and use cloud platforms since it is essential in the age of big data, even though they rarely do this on the job themselves. \n\nMy data engineer friends on the other hand say that data engineering tools are easy to learn, change too often, and are becoming increasingly abstracted, making developing a strong product/business sense a wiser choice. \n\nIs either group right? \n\nAm I overthinking and would be better off just following whichever path interests me most? \n\nEDIT: I think the essence of my question was to assume that candidates have solid business knowledge.

    "text": "Hello All, after a very long struggle with landing my first data science job, I got a ridiculous offer and would like to know how to proceed. For context, I have 7 years of medtech experience, not specifically in data science but similar and an undergrad in stats and now a masters in data science. I am located in the US.\n\nI've been talking with a company for months now and had several interviews even without a specific position available. Well they finally opened two positions, one associate and one senior with salary ranges of 66-99k and 130k-180k respectively. I applied for both and when HR got involved for the offer they said they could probably just split the difference for 110k. Sure that's fine. However, a couple days later, they called again and offered 60-70k, below even the lower limit of the associate range. So my question is has this happened to anyone else? Is this HR's way of trying to get me to just go away?\n\nMaybe I'm just frustrated since HR said the salary range listed on the job req isn't actually what they are willing to pay",

    "text": "I’m based in the Bay Area with 5 YOE. A couple of months ago, I interviewed for a role I wasn’t too excited about, but the pay was super compelling. In the first recruiter call, they asked for my salary expectations. I asked for their range, as an example here, let’s say they said $150K–$180K. I said, “That works, I’m looking for something above $150K.” I think this was my first mistake, more on that later.\n\nI am a person with low self esteem(or serious imposter syndrome) and when I say I nailed all 8 rounds, I really must believe that. The recruiter followed up the day after 8th round saying team is interested in extending an offer. Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.\n\nNext day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing  other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work. They will come back and say can’t do 150 but can do 140. But I guess not.",

I have tried to supplement this by doing physics and applied math research.

    "title": "What’s next for a 11 YOE data scientist?",
    "text": "Hi folks,\nHope you’re having a great day wherever you are in the world.\n\nContext:\nI’ve been in the data science industry for the past 11 years. I started my career in telecom, where I worked extensively on time series analysis and data cleaning using R, Java, and Pig.\n\nAfter about two years, I landed my first “data scientist” role in a bank, and I’ve been in the financial sector ever since. Over time, I picked up Python, Spark, and TensorFlow to build ML models for marketing analytics and recommendation systems. It was a really fun period — the industry wasn’t as mature back then. I used to get ridiculously excited whenever new boosting algorithms came out (think XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM) and spent hours experimenting with ensemble techniques to squeeze out higher uplift.\n\nI also did quite a bit of statistical A/B testing — not just basic t-tests, but full experiment design with power analysis, control-treatment stratification, and post-hoc validation to account for selection bias and seasonality effects. I enjoyed quantifying incremental lift properly, whether through classical hypothesis testing or uplift modeling frameworks, and working with business teams to translate those metrics into campaign ROI or customer conversion outcomes.\n\nFast forward to today — I’ve been at my current company for about two years. Every department now wants to apply Gen AI (and even “agentic AI”) even though we haven’t truly tested or measured many real-world efficiency gains yet. I spend most of my time in meetings listening to people talk all day about AI. Then I head back to my table to do prompt engineering, data cleaning, testing, and evaluation. Honestly, it feels off-putting that even my business stakeholders can now write decent prompts. I don’t feel like I’m contributing much anymore. Sure, the surrounding processes are important — but they’ve become mundane, repetitive busywork.\n\nI’m feeling understimulated intellectually and overstimulated by meetings, requests, and routine tasks.\nAnyone else in the same boat? Does this feel like the end of a data science journey? Am I far too gone? It’s been 11 years for me, and lately, I’ve been seriously considering moving into education — somewhere I might actually feel like I’m contributing again.",

    "title": "Ace The Interview - SQL Intuitively and Exhaustively Explained",
    "text": "SQL is easy to learn and hard to master. Realistically, the difficulty of the questions you get will largely be dictated by the job role you're trying to fill.\n\nFrom it's highest level, SQL is a \"declarative language\", meaning it doesn't define a set of operations, but rather a desired end result. This can make SQL incredibly expressive, but also a bit counterintuitive, especially if you aren't fully aware of it's declarative nature.\n\nSQL expressions are passed through an SQL engine, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. Thes engines parse out your SQL expressions, optimize them, and turn them into an actual list of steps to get the data you want. While not as often discussed, for beginners I recommend SQLite. It's easy to set up in virtually any environment, and allows you to get rocking with SQL quickly. If you're working in big data, I recommend also brushing up on something like PostgreSQL, but the differences are not so bad once you have a solid SQL understanding.\n\nIn being a high level declaration, SQL’s grammatical structure is, fittingly, fairly high level. It’s kind of a weird, super rigid version of English. SQL queries are largely made up of:\n\n* **Keywords:** special words in SQL that tell an engine what to do. Some common ones, which we’ll discuss, are `SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY` . They can be lowercase or uppercase, but usually they’re written in uppercase.\n* **Identifiers:** Identifiers are the names of database objects like tables, columns, etc.\n* **Literals:** numbers, text, and other hardcoded values\n* **Operators:** Special characters or keywords used in comparison and arithmetic operations. For example `!=`, `&lt;` ,`OR`, `NOT` , `*`, `/`, `%` , `IN`, `LIKE` . We’ll cover these later.\n* **Clauses:** These are the major building block of SQL, and can be stitched together to combine a queries general behavior. They usually start with a keyword, like \n   * `SELECT` – defines which columns to return \n   * `FROM` – defines the source table \n   * `WHERE` – filters rows \n   * `GROUP BY` – groups rows etc.  \n\nBy combining these clauses, you create an SQL query\n\nThere are a ton of things you can do in SQL, like create tables:\n\n    CREATE TABLE People(first_name, last_name, age, favorite_color)\n\nInsert data into tables:\n\n    INSERT INTO People\n    VALUES\n        ('Tom', 'Sawyer', 19, 'White'),\n        ('Mel', 'Gibson', 69, 'Green'),\n        ('Daniel', 'Warfiled', 27, 'Yellow')\n\nSelect certain data from tables:\n\n    SELECT first_name, favorite_color FROM People\n\nSearch based on some filter\n\n    SELECT * FROM People WHERE id = 3\n\nAnd Delete Data\n\n    DELETE FROM People WHERE age &lt; 30 \n\nWhat was previously mentioned makes up the cornerstone of pretty much all of SQL. Everything else builds on it, and there is a lot.\n\n**Primary and Foreign Keys**  \nA *primary key* is a unique identifier for each record in a table. A *foreign key* references a primary key in another table, allowing you to relate data across tables. This is the backbone of relational database design.\n\n**Super Keys and Composite Keys**  \nA *super key* is any combination of columns that can uniquely identify a row. When a unique combination requires multiple columns, it’s often called a *composite key* — useful in complex schemas like logs or transactions.\n\n**Normalization and Database Design**  \nNormalization is the process of splitting data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy. First Normal Form (1NF) ensures atomic rows, Second Normal Form (2NF) separates logically distinct data, and Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates derived data stored in the same table.\n\n**Creating Relational Schemas in SQLite**  \nYou can explicitly define tables with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints using `CREATE TABLE`. These relationships enforce referential integrity and enable behaviors like cascading deletes. SQLite enforces `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints strictly, making your schema more robust.\n\n**Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**  \nERDs visually represent tables and their relationships. Dotted lines and cardinality markers like `{0,1}` or `0..N` indicate how many records in one table relate to another, which helps document and debug schema logic.\n\n**JOINs**  \nJOIN operations combine rows from multiple tables using foreign keys. `INNER JOIN` includes only matched rows, `LEFT JOIN` includes all from the left table, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` (emulated in SQLite) combines both. Proper JOINs are critical for data integration.\n\n**Filtering and LEFT/RIGHT JOIN Differences**  \nJOIN order affects which rows are preserved when there’s no match. For example, using `LEFT JOIN` ensures all left-hand rows are kept — useful for identifying unmatched data. SQLite lacks `RIGHT JOIN`, but you can simulate it by flipping the table order in a `LEFT JOIN`.\n\n**Simulating FULL OUTER JOINs**  \nSQLite doesn’t support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but you can emulate it with a `UNION` of two `LEFT JOIN` queries and a `WHERE` clause to catch nulls from both sides. This approach ensures no records are lost in either table.\n\n**The WHERE Clause and Filtration**  \n`WHERE` filters records based on conditions, supporting logical operators (`AND`, `OR`), numeric comparisons, and string operations like `LIKE`, `IN`, and `REGEXP`. It's one of the most frequently used clauses in SQL.\n\n**DISTINCT Selections**  \nUse `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique values from a column. You can also select distinct combinations of columns (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT name, grade`) to avoid duplicate rows in the result.\n\n**Grouping and Aggregation Functions**  \nWith `GROUP BY`, you can compute metrics like `AVG`, `SUM`, or `COUNT` for each group. `HAVING` lets you filter grouped results, like showing only departments with an average salary above a threshold.\n\n**Ordering and Limiting Results**  \n`ORDER BY` sorts results by one or more columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned, and `OFFSET` lets you skip rows — useful for pagination or ranked listings.\n\n**Updating and Deleting Data**  \n`UPDATE` modifies existing rows using `SET`, while `DELETE` removes rows based on `WHERE` filters. These operations can be combined with other clauses to selectively change or clean up data.\n\n**Handling NULLs**  \n`NULL` represents missing or undefined values. You can detect them using `IS NULL` or replace them with defaults using `COALESCE`. Aggregates like `AVG(column)` ignore NULLs by default, while `COUNT(*)` includes all rows.\n\n**Subqueries**  \nSubqueries are nested `SELECT` statements used inside `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT`. They’re useful for filtering by aggregates, comparisons, or generating intermediate results for more complex logic.\n\n**Correlated Subqueries**  \nThese are subqueries that reference columns from the outer query. Each row in the outer query is matched against a custom condition in the subquery — powerful but often inefficient unless optimized.\n\n**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  \nCTEs let you define temporary named result sets with `WITH`. They make complex queries readable by breaking them into logical steps and can be used multiple times within the same query.\n\n**Recursive CTEs**  \nRecursive CTEs solve hierarchical problems like org charts or category trees. A base case defines the start, and a recursive step extends the output until no new rows are added. Useful for generating sequences or computing reporting chains.\n\n**Window Functions**  \nWindow functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Examples include `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER ()`, and moving averages with sliding windows.\n\nThese all can be combined together to do a lot of different stuff.\n\nIn my opinion, this is too much to learn efficiently learn outright. It requires practice and the slow aggregation of concepts over many projects. If you're new to SQL, I recommend studying the basics and learning through doing. However, if you're on the job hunt and you need to cram, you might find this breakdown useful: [https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively](https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively)",

I suck at comms and selling my work, and the more higher up I'm going in the organization, I realize I need to be strategic with selling my work, and also in dealing with people.

(also want to add that I have social anxiety). Perhaps one of the things might help is probably upskilling on the social front.

It became enough of a popular rhetoric that people said they preferred to hire a coder with some math knowledge than a math person with some coding knowledge. \n\nAs a Statistician that works in Research Data Science with an average level of coding experience, enough to write my own code in notebooks, but translating it into a fully fleshed Python module with classes and functions was much more difficult for me. For a while I thought my lack of advanced software engineering knowledge would become a crutch in my career and as someone with a busy personal life I didn't want to spend that much time learning these fundamentals. Then, my company rolled out LLM's integrated into the software we use, like Visual Studio. Suddenly I'm able to create fully fleshed out modules from my notebooks in a flash. I can ask the LLM to write unit tests to test out how my code processes data or test its various subfunctions. I can use it to code up various types of models quickly to compare results. Handing off my code to engineering in the form of a Python package wasn't such a pain anymore. \n\nSure the LLM produces some weird results sometimes, and I do have to spend time making sure I ask it the correct things and/or cleaning up the code so that it works properly. But now I feel like that crutch I had is no longer present.",

    "text": "I finished my PhD in CS three years ago, and I've been working as a data scientist for the past two years, exclusively using Python. I love it, especially the statistical side and scripting capabilities, but lately, I've been feeling a bit constrained by only using one language.\n\nI'm debating whether it's worthwhile to branch out and learn another language to broaden my horizons. R seems appealing given my interests in stats, but I'm also curious about languages like Julia, Scala, or even something completely different.\n\nHas anyone here faced a similar decision? Did learning another language significantly boost your career, or was it just a nice-to-have skill? Or maybe this is just a waste of time?\n\nThanks for any insights!\n\nUpdate: I'm not completely sure about my long term goals, tbh. I do like statistics and stuff like causal inference, and Bayesian inference looks appealing. At the same time I feel that doing some DL might also be great and practical as they are the most requested in the industry (took some courses about NLP but at my work we mostly do tabular data with classical ML).

A simple example is if you have a revenue dashboard showing net revenue and a PM, director etc wanted you to add an additional gross revenue metric. With the tools I'm aware of I would have to go into the BI tool and update the chart myself to show that metric.
