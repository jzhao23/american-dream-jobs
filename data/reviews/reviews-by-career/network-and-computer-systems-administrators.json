    "title": "IT Team fired",
    "text": "Showed up to work like any other day. Suddenly, I realize I can’t access any admin centers. While I’m trying to figure out what’s going on, I get a call from HR—I’m fired, along with the entire IT team (helpdesk, network engineers, architects, security).\n\nSome colleagues had been with the company for 8–10 years. No warnings, no discussions—just locked out and replaced. They decided to put a software developer manager as “Head of IT” to liaise with an MSP that’s taking over everything. Good luck to them, taking over the environment with zero support on the inside.\n\nNo severance offered, which means we’ll have to lawyer up if we want even a chance at getting anything. They also still owe me a bonus from last year, which I’m sure they won’t pay. Just a rant. Companies suck sometimes.\n\nEdit: We’re in EU. And thank you all for your comments, makes me feel less alone. \nAlready got a couple of interviews lined up so moving forward.\n\n\nEdit 2: Seems like the whole thing was a hostile takeover of the company by new management and they wanted to get rid of the IT team that was ‘loyal’ to previous management. We’ll fight to get paid for the next 2-3 months as it was specified in our contracts, and maybe severance as there was no real reason for them to fire us. The MSP is now in charge.Happy to be out. Once things cool off I’ll make an update with more info. \nFor now I just thank you all for your kind comments, support and advice!",

    "title": "\"Umm, I'm Gen Z.  I know how to use computers.\"",
    "text": "I was onboarding a new employee in my office the other day and going through the usual setup process. After configuring their 2FA, I had them sign into their assigned laptop. While the profile loads, usually about 60 seconds on first login, I typically use that time to go over a few policies, domain links, where to submit a ticket, and explain our phishing campaign.  I do all of this from my computer to save time.\n\nAs soon as he signed in, I said, \"Let's give your profile a moment to load and I'll show you a few things in our environment.\"  \nBefore I could continue, he cut me off in a somewhat arrogant tone with, \"Umm, I'm Gen Z. I know how to use computers.\"\n\nI replied, \"Of course. I just need to show you a few things specific to our environment.  Do you know what a phishing email is?\"\n\nHe looked at me like a deer in headlights.  \n\"A what?\"  \n\"A phishing email.\"  \n\"I don't know what that is.\"\n\nNo problem. I gave him a quick rundown on what phishing looks like, how our simulator works, and how to report suspicious emails. He wasn't rude, but he definitely looked at me like I was some out-of-touch boomer trying to mansplain the internet while he sipped his Starbucks Frappuccino. (To be honest though, I do have a grey beard but I'm no where near a boomer's age.  I'm Gen X)\n\nThe funny part is, I could have just handed him the laptop with no explanation. But without that introduction, he almost certainly would have clicked one of the simulated emails in the first few days, which automatically enrolls users in mandatory extended training.  Or even worse, a real threat.  And guess who that reflects on? Us, for \"not informing the user.\"  I have all users sign an inventory sheet that also states we went over a brief phishing explanation so they can't ever say we didn't inform them.\n\nI’m just venting a bit about how people can sometimes come across as assuming or defensive when IT is simply trying to do its job.  Kind of like we're speaking down to them.  And to be fair, that attitude isn't tied to any one generation, I’ve seen it across the board.",

    "text": "I have only been in IT for 10 years, but in those 10 years it has changed dramatically. You used to have tech nerds, who had to act corporate at certain times, leading the way in your IT department. These people grew up liking computers and technology, bringing them into the field. This is probably in the 80s - 2000s. You used to have to learn hands on and get dirty \"Pay your dues\" in the help desk department. It was almost as if you had to like IT/technology as a hobby to get into this field. You had to be curious and not willing to take no for an answer.\n\nNow bosses are no longer tech nerds. Now no one wants to do help desk. No one wants to troubleshoot issues. Users want answers on anything and everything right at that moment by messaging you on Teams. If you don't write back within 15 minutes, you get a 2nd message asking if you saw it. Bosses who have never worked a day in IT think they know IT because their cousin is in IT.\n\nWhat happened to a senior sysadmin helping a junior sysadmin learn something? This is how I learned so much, from my former bosses who took me under their wing. Now every tech thinks they have all the answers without doing any of the work, just ask ChatGPT and even if it's totally wrong, who cares, we gave the user something.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have been fortunate enough to have a career I like. IT has given me solid earnings throughout the years.",

Just cold, brutal economics.\n\nHe’s got that rare combo: deep tech chops, calm under fire, and knows how to talk to everyone — from end users to C-levels. People love working with him. He’s the guy who makes you feel like things are under control even when everything’s burning.\n\nNow?

My guy’s inbox is now a warzone because I’ve been spamming him with so many contacts and leads he might start regretting ever working with me haha.\n\nBut here's the best part: he’s already connected with a bunch of you.

    "title": "Tonight, we turn it ALL off",
    "text": "It all starts at 10pm Saturday night. They want ALL servers, and I do mean ALL turned off in our datacenter. \n\nApparently, this extremely forward-thinking company who's entire job is helping protect in the cyber arena didn't have the foresight to make our datacenter unable to move to some alternative power source. \n\nSo when we were told by the building team we lease from they have to turn off the power to make a change to the building, we were told to turn off all the servers. \n\n40+ system admins/dba's/app devs will all be here shortly to start this. \n\nHow will it turn out? Who even knows. My guess is the shutdown will be just fine, its the startup on Sunday that will be the interesting part. \n\nAm I venting? Kinda. \n\nAm I commiserating? Kinda. \n\nAm I just telling this story starting before it starts happening? Yeah that mostly. \nMore I am just telling the story before it happens. \n\nShould be fun, and maybe flawless execution will happen tonight and tomorrow, and I can laugh at this post when I stumble across it again sometime in the future.\n\nEDIT 1(Sat 11PM): We are seeing weird issues on shutdown of esxi hosted VMs where the guest shutdown isn't working correctly, and the host hangs in a weird state. Or we are finding the VM is already shutdown but none of us (the ones who should shut it down) did it. \n\nEDIT 2(Sun 3AM): I left at 3AM, a few more were still back, but they were thinking 10 more mins and they would leave too. But the shutdown was strange enough, we shall see how startup goes. \n\nEDIT 3(Sun 8AM): Up and ready for when I get the phone call to come on in and get things running again. While I enjoy these espresso shots at my local Starbies, a few answers for a lot of the common things in the comments:\n\n* Thank you everyone for your support, I figured this would be intresting to post, I didn't expect this much support, you all are very kind\n\n* We do have UPS and even a diesel generator onsite, but we were told from much higher up \"Not an option, turn it all off\". This job is actually very good, but also has plenty of bureaucracy and red tape. So at some point, even if you disagree that is how it has to be handled, you show up Saturday night to shut it down anyway. \n\n* 40+ is very likely too many people, but again, bureaucracy and red tape. \n\n* I will provide more updates as I get them. But first we have to get the internet up in the office...\n\nEDIT 4(Sun 10:30AM): Apparently the power up procedures are not going very well in the datacenter, my equipment is unplugged thankfully and we are still standing by for the green light to come in.\n\nEDIT 5(Sun 1:15PM): Greenlight to begin the startup process (I am posting this around 12:15pm as once I go in, no internet for a while). What is also crazy is I was told our datacenter AC stayed on the whole time. Meaning, we have things setup to keep all of that powered, but not the actual equipment, which begs a lot of questions I feel. \n\nEDIT 6 (Sun 7:00PM): Most everyone is still here, there have been hiccups as expected. Even with some of my gear, but not because the procedures are wrong, but things just aren't quite \"right\" lots of T/S trying to find and fix root causes, its feeling like a long night. \n\nEDIT 7 (Sun 8:30PM): This is looking wrapped up. I am still here for a little longer, last guy on the team in case some \"oh crap\" is found, but that looks unlikely. I think we made it. A few network gremlins for sure, and it was almost the fault of DNS, but thankfully it worked eventually, so I can't check \"It was always DNS\" off my bingo card. Spinning drives all came up without issue, and all my stuff took a little bit more massaging to work around the network problems, but came up and has been great since. The great news is I am off tommorow, living that Tue-Fri 10 hours a workday life, so Mondays are a treat. Hopefully the rest of my team feels the same way about their Monday.\n\nEDIT 8 (Tue 11:45AM): Monday was a great day. I was off and got no phone calls, nor did I come in to a bunch of emails that stuff was broken. We are fixing a few things to make the process more bullet proof with our stuff, and then on a much wider scale, tell the bosses, in After Action Reports what should be fixed. I do appreciate all of the help, and my favorite comment and has been passed to my bosses is \n\n\"You all don't have a datacenter, you have a server room\"\n\nThat comment is exactly right. There is no reason we should not be able to do a lot of the suggestions here, A/B power, run the generator, have UPS who's batteries can be pulled out but power stays up, and even more to make this a real data center. \n\nLastly, I sincerely thank all of you who were in here supporting and critiquing things. It was very encouraging, and I can't wait to look back at this post sometime in the future and realize the internet isn't always just a toxic waste dump. Keep fighting the good fight out there y'all!",

I would have eaten tons of shit just to stay employed, because homelessness really sucked.\n\nSo 15 years later, when I'm a consultant, post sys-admin and sys-eng, and my boss starts literally yelling at me in a meeting with my peers because of an email that I hadn't sent yet, it was quite shocking when my hand moved towards the end call button on its own.\n\nIm tired, friends. I have no more room in my heart for sitting quietly while some manager with zero technical background; whom I warned for months was making very poor decisions on this project, starts pointing fingers and placing blame. I don't need this. No one needs this.\n\nThere's a big world out there. Don't let these cretins ruin your life, because chances are, they know jack shit and are merely pretenders.\n\n  \nEdit- Thank you everyone for your kindness. I sent an email to HR, so I'll see what happens next I guess. I have my cats and my wife to pick me back up, so I think I'll be okay either way :)",

    "text": "Over the past few weeks, I’ve been dealing with a frustrating issue with our enterprise server infrastructure. Our systems, which host critical applications, databases, and business services, would randomly go offline. There were no crashes, no hardware failures — the servers just disappeared from the network, though they were still running.\n\n\n\nI started troubleshooting the network, diving into our UniFi building bridge configuration, checking for packet loss, and reviewing our firewall settings. Some days, everything worked perfectly. Other days, without warning, the servers would drop offline. It was baffling, and nothing in the logs pointed to an obvious problem.\n\n\n\nThen, I noticed something strange. Every time I was physically present in the server room, the systems would stay online. But as soon as I left, the network would fail. The servers were still up, but they were unreachable.\n\n\n\nAfter further investigation, I discovered something that made me question my entire approach: The UniFi switch was plugged into an outlet controlled by a motion-sensor for the server room lighting. When I was in the room, the sensor kept the lights — and thus the switch — powered. When I left, the lights turned off, cutting the power to the switch, which dropped the network connection.\n\n\n\nI couldn’t believe it. The problem wasn’t with the network at all — it was a power issue, disguised as something much more complicated. Since then, I moved the switch to a dedicated outlet and everything has been smooth sailing.\n\n\n\nSometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.\n\n(The while room has battery backup power, including the lights. Don’t start ranting about UPSs.)",

Now it's clicking through \"wizards\" and \"dashboards\" and \"control panels\" like I'm ordering takeout.\n\nVMware vSphere? Web app. Can't use the old client anymore. \"Deprecated.\" Now it's HTML5 and takes 47 seconds to load the console. The console,lol... It's literally just text! But no, needs WebSocket, Canvas rendering, 400MB of JS just to show me a kernel panic.\n\nThe new firewall has a \"beautiful intuitive web interface.\" You know what was intuitive? iptables. One line. Done. Now I'm dragging boxes around like I'm making a PowerPoint. \"Would you like to add this rule to your security policy?\" No, I'd like to type three commands and go home.\n\niDRAC, iLO, IPMI - all web interfaces now. Used to be serial console. 9600 baud. Worked during a nuclear war. Now? \"Please enable JavaScript.\" \"Please update your browser.\" \"Please accept our cookies.\" I'M TRYING TO REBOOT A CRASHED SERVER NOT SHOP FOR SHOES.\n\nBest part: the web UI crashes.\n\nServer's fine. Running for 400 days. The management interface? \"Connection lost. Please refresh.\" Refresh. \"Loading...\" Ten minutes. \"Session expired.\" Log in again. 2FA. SMS code. Type it in. \"Loading dashboard...\" Dashboard appears. Click anything. \"Connection lost.\"\n\nMeanwhile, SSH still works. But no, that's \"legacy.\" That's \"insecure.\" Karen from compliance says we need \"audit trails\" and \"role-based access control.\" So now everything goes through a web app that logs every click to a database that fills up every week.\n\nTried to copy a config file yesterday. In the old days:\n\n    scp config.conf server:/etc/\n\nNow:\n\n1. Log into web interface\n2. Navigate to \"Configuration Management\"\n3. Click \"Upload Configuration\"\n4. Choose file (only .xml accepted)\n5. \"Converting configuration...\"\n6. \"Validating...\"\n7. \"Would you like to create a backup?\"\n8. \"Please enter a description for this change\"\n9. \"Submit for approval\"\n10. Wait for email\n11. Click approval link\n12. \"Session expired\"\n\nDocker Portainer. Kubernetes Dashboard. Grafana. Prometheus. All web apps to manage things that should be text files. Your monitoring system needs monitoring. Your dashboard needs a dashboard.\n\n\"But it's user-friendly!\" For whom? Users who shouldn't have access to servers? If you need a GUI to manage a server, you shouldn't be managing servers.\n\nPeak stupidity: terminal emulators in the browser.\n\nWe put a terminal... in a web page... to connect to a server... to avoid using an actual terminal. It's SSH with extra steps and input lag. Every keystroke goes through seventeen layers of JavaScript. Paste doesn't work. Function keys don't work. Ctrl+C kills the browser tab instead of the process.\n\nBut it's \"modern.\" It's \"accessible.\" It's \"cloud-native.\"\n\nIt's shit\n\n**Edit:** Since you're missing the point: I'm not against automation. \n\nThe problem is replacing simple, working automation with complex, fragile automation that does the same thing but with more failure modes. My shell scripts are infrastructure as code. They just don't need a venture-funded company and 400MB of Go binaries to run.\n\n**Edit 2** The obsession with buzzwords like \"Infrastructure as Code\" while dismissing shell scripts (which are literally code managing infrastructure) shows people value labels over understanding.",

I know how to use computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ph0gmo/umm_im_gen_z_i_know_how_to_use_computers)\" reminded me of a user I briefly knew, way back in the day.\n\nThis was about 15 years ago, when our hotel's internet pipe was a bonded T1, IIRC.  4.5Mb total.  We also used a corporate Exchange server, so all 110 hotels in North America went back to those servers.\n\nAnyway, we had this brand new sales admin who was kind of a smarmy know-it-all.  When I onboarded her, she gave me this attitude that she already knew it all and didn't need me telling her the basics.  Okay, fair enough.  Less work for me, so I just gave her her logon, told her the basics about our environment and left her alone.\n\nAbout four hours later, I get a call from the corporate Exchange admin, telling me that this lady had sent an email with a 25Mb file attachment.  On top of that, she had sent it to everyone in the sales department.  Back then, this was enough to take down email for every one of those 110 hotels.  Thousands of users.  He killed the email and service was restored, but suggested I talk to her.  Yep, agreed.\n\nSo I stop by her desk and let her know that we don't have enough bandwidth to support sending that kind of attachment and, btw, we do have a file server and you really should save that file in the sales department's folder.  I had told her about the file server during onboarding, but she obviously didn't listen.  She kinda blow me off but seemed to at least understand me, so I left it alone, although I did tell the sales &amp; marketing director why their email was down for an hour.  Nothing malicious; she had asked because she was understandably concerned.\n\nNext day, I get another call from the Exchange admin.  Same situation, but with a 37Mb attachment this time.  So I go up there and reiterate my point, and she tells me, \"my husband works in IT and he's way smarter than you!  He makes double what you'd making.\"  Ohhh kay... I don't know how/why that's relevant, but I don't rise to the bait and I don't reply.  I do, however, tell the sales &amp; marketing director why their email has been down twice in two days and who's responsible.\n\nThird day, I get a call from the sales &amp; marketing director.  The entire sales &amp; marketing departmental folder is completely gone.  Luckily, I had shadow copy enabled, so it was a pretty quick fix, but the director asks me how this happened?  Well, looking at the logs, it's my favorite sales admin.  I let the director know.\n\nFourth day, I get another call from the sales &amp; marketing director.  The entire sales &amp; marketing folder is completely gone yet again.  Restored again, told her who was responsible.\n\nFast forward about 15 minutes or so and I get a call from my boss to disable the admin's account as she's been fired.\n\nKinda had to laugh at that.\n\nEDIT: Since it seems to be coming up a lot, I want to add that a.) I wasn't the Exchange admin, b.) this was the hotel industry 15+ years ago, when all you needed to get an IT job was a pulse and knowledge of how to turn a computer on, and c.) neither the Exchange admin nor I had any idea what a message size limit was.  Or maybe he did and just chose to disable it.  As mentioned in point a, I wasn't the Exchange guy.",

    "title": "NIST reports atomic clock failure at Boulder CO",
    "text": "&gt; Dear colleagues,\n\n&gt; In short, the atomic ensemble time scale at our Boulder campus has failed\n&gt; due to a prolonged utility power outage. One impact is that the Boulder\n&gt; Internet Time Services no longer have an accurate time reference. At time\n&gt; of writing the Boulder servers are still available due a standby power\n&gt; generator, but I will attempt to disable them to avoid disseminating\n&gt; incorrect time.\n\n&gt; The affected servers are:\n\n&gt; time-a-b.nist.gov\n\n&gt; time-b-b.nist.gov\n\n&gt; time-c-b.nist.gov\n\n&gt; time-d-b.nist.gov\n\n&gt; time-e-b.nist.gov\n\n&gt; ntp-b.nist.gov (authenticated NTP)\n\n&gt; No time to repair estimate is available until we regain staff access and\n&gt; power. Efforts are currently focused on obtaining an alternate source of\n&gt; power so the hydrogen maser clocks survive beyond their battery backups.\n\n&gt; More details follow.\n\n&gt; Due to prolonged high wind gusts there have been a combination of utility\n&gt; power line damage and preemptive utility shutdowns (in the interest of\n&gt; wildfire prevention) in the Boulder, CO area. NIST's campus lost utility\n&gt; power Wednesday (Dec. 17 2025) around 22:23 UTC. At time of writing utility\n&gt; power is still off to the campus. Facility operators anticipated needing to\n&gt; shutdown the heat-exchange infrastructure providing air cooling to many\n&gt; parts of the building, including some internal networking closets. As a\n&gt; result, many of these too were preemptively shutdown with the result that\n&gt; our group lacks much of the monitoring and control capabilities we\n&gt; ordinarily have. Also, the site has been closed to all but emergency\n&gt; personnel Thursday and Friday, and at time of writing remains closed.\n\n&gt; At initial power loss, there was no immediate impact to the NIST atomic\n&gt; time scale or distribution services because the projects are afforded\n&gt; standby power generators. However, we now have strong evidence one of the\n&gt; crucial generators has failed. In the downstream path is the primary signal\n&gt; distribution chain, including to the Boulder Internet Time Service. Another\n&gt; campus building houses additional clocks backed up by a different power\n&gt; generator; if these survive it will allow us to re-align the primary time\n&gt; scale when site stability returns without making use of external clocks or\n&gt; reference signals.\n\nhttps://lists.nanog.org/archives/list/nanog@lists.nanog.org/message/ACADD3NKOG2QRWZ56OSNNG7UIEKKTZXL/\n\nedit: [CBS reports](https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/power-outage-boulder-atomic-clock-nist/) the drift is 4 microseconds\n\n&gt; \"As a result of that lapse, NIST UTC drifted by about 4 microseconds\"\n\nupdate:\n\n&gt; To put a deviation of a few microseconds in context, the NIST time scale usually performs about five thousand times better than this at the nanosecond scale by composing a special statistical average of many clocks. Such precision is important for scientific applications, telecommunications, critical infrastructure, and integrity monitoring of positioning systems. But this precision is not achievable with time transfer over the public Internet; uncertainties on the order of 1 millisecond (one thousandth of one second) are more typical due to asymmetry and fluctuations in packet delay. \n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/list.nist.gov/g/internet-time-service/c/OHOO_1OYjLY",

But my Monday is not about them its about a realtors office. \n\nMonday morning i was tasked with backing up a users data / programs and restoring it to a new laptop they had ordered from us. Easy enough i thought i've likely done 100+ of these so far in my career. I'm working with a new helpdesk person this Monday was the start of his 3rd week. Fresh out of college. He's as green as green can be for a tech. Our lab area was full so we were working in an empty cube and had the laptop hooked up to a 26 inch monitor for better visibility. I went over the steps with our new guy and let him know the first thing to do was get a backup. Thankfully he's done a few so he didn't need my guidance during this part and i walked away for about 20 minutes. \n\nWhen i came back i found that the backup was only about 20% complete and i was expecting it to be finishing up or finished at this point. I asked if he had just started and was told no the laptop just has tons of data and the drive was 97% full. \n\nUgh.. Ok. \"Lets poke around and see if he's caching like 80GB of exchange email or something.\" \n\nWe poked around and to our dismay a folder on the desktop was the culprit. 172GB folder with the name \"Business and Work files\" Looking back everything inside my brain should have been screaming at me not to open that folder but i had the tech open it anyway. \n\nOf course right as we opened it the owner of the company was walking right past and yeah..... Child pr0n, Gay Pr0n, i mean you name it. All with not just a file list but the view set to Extra large icons. All three of us got a eye searing look into the deepest darkest shit the internet had to offer before i could slam the laptop shut. \n\nBefore i could even speak the owner said to us. \"Both of you don't move. No one touch that laptop I'm going to call the police\"  \n\nThe rest of the day was basically a blur of police interviews, between just regular cops that came first, a detective and later a forensic detective near the end of the day. This morning was a long management meeting about the incident and how the client in question is no longer a client and to forward any communication from them direct to our manager or the owner. \n\nThe owner gave me and the new guy the rest of the day off and Wednesday paid to reflect. Basically just told us to take the time, have some fun and try and forget the incident. \n\nIf any one has any questions i'll try and answer what i can. I haven't been told not to say anything other than not to name names / the companies involved. I'll try and answer what i can.  ",

These are positions that mostly involve imaging new builds, replacing broken keyboards, changing out toner cartridges, occasionally patching in a network drop, etc. The positions pay $36.5k / year. Granted it's in a LCOL area in the Midwest, but still.\n\nSo I'm flipping through this stack of 20+ resumes on his desk, and it's all recent college grads, or post high school with A+ - basically, exactly the resumes you would expect for a position that *you, yourself,* are calling \"entry level\".\n\nNope! He want's someone with *at least* six years of experience and a four year degree or multiple progressive certs. For $36k a year. To change out toner cartridges and plug in keyboards. We've all heard of companies like that, but I guess I'd just never come face-to-face with that line of thinking.... Honestly didn't even know what to say.\n\nEDIT: For everyone asking: The next time we're sitting around drinking beers on his porch, I'll have no problem tell him he's a fucking idiot.

I’ve got 6+ years of experience, and my friends in the trades are clearing way more than I am, with half the stress and none of the corporate nonsense.\n\nMost companies expect you to be an entire IT department in one body — sysadmin, help desk, cybersecurity, project manager, cable runner, and unofficial therapist — all rolled into one. And they want to pay you like you just learned how to reset a router.\n\nIt’s a never-ending grind of certs, degrees, and “keeping your skills sharp” just to stay in the same place. Half the stuff you’re pressured to learn? You’ll never even touch it in the real world. Just fluff to tick a box on a job listing.\n\nRespect? Forget it. You’re invisible when things work and public enemy #1 when Karen’s printer won’t connect. Everyone’s got jokes until the network goes down — then suddenly you’re supposed to be a magician. People laugh when I say I work in IT.\n\nAnd moving up? Good luck. It’s less about skill and more about kissing the right ass. Office politics and fake enthusiasm get you further than real knowledge. You could be carrying the whole team, and still get passed over.\n\nI hope this offends a few nerds who think they’ve “made it” — maybe you need a wake-up call too. IT can be useful, sure, but don’t act like it’s the golden path. If you don’t absolutely love this field or have a clear exit plan, you’re probably wasting your time.\n",

    "text": "So this may sound like gating, and maybe it is, but I feel like there's far too many people going into \"advanced\" career paths right out of school, without having gone through the paces first. To me, there are definitively levels in computing jobs. Helpdesk, Junior Developer, those are what you would expect new graduates to go into. Cybersecurity, DevOps, those are advanced paths that require more than book knowledge.\n\nThe main issue I see is that something like DevOps is all about bridging the realm of developers and IT operations together. How are you going to do that if you haven't experienced how developers and operations work? Especially in an enterprise setting. On paper, building a Jenkins pipeline or GitHub action is just a matter of learning which button to press and what script to write. But in reality there's so much more involved, including dealing with various teams, knowing how software developers typically deploy code, what blue/green deployment is, etc.\n\nSame with cybersecurity. You can learn all about zero-day exploits and how to run detection tools in school, but when you see how enterprises deal with IT in the real world, and you hear about some team deploying a PoC 6 months ago, you should instantly realize that these resources are most likely still running, with no software updates for the past 6 months. You know what shadow IT is, what arguments are likely to make management act on security issues, why implementing a simple AWS Backup project could take 6+ months and a team of 5 people when you might be able to do it over a weekend for your own workloads.\n\nI guess I just wanted to see whether you all had a different perspective on this. I fear too many people focus on a specific career path without first learning the basics.",

My GPA never went under a 3.8 and I made sure to TA and volunteer early on. \n\nLike the point is, it makes me sick people think they can skip all of this and get to that salary, it just sounds so entitled hearing “can I get into tech with just my A+, full remote, and pays at least 100k.” The amount of post I see per day asking this is just disgusting, yes it sounds like I’m gatekeeping from the field, but tbh I would not really have an issue with people who wanted to get into this field, did their research that market is rough, and have realistic expectations on what they need to get their first helpdesk job.\n\nWhy does everyone keep looking at the one guy who made six figures, no experience. It’s a one off situation, why does everyone keep people suddenly think they’re built different than others after seeing one YouTube video? \n\nAlso spoiler alert, majority of people in IT don’t make six figures, there’s a reason why six figures is the top 15% in the US. within that 15% there are doctors, lawyers, politicians, other engineers unrelated to tech. So how many tech people do you really think make six figures? Be real people, and if you’re in IT or getting into IT, you should have the logical comprehension to figuring that shit out. ",

    "text": "I (24M) have been doing IT for a chain of clinics for over a year with no issues—until today. I was on a call helping a doctor with some software. About 10 minutes in (only 4 of which I was actually on his laptop), he snapped and said, “I have shit to do and you’re just fucking around. Can you get someone who knows what the fuck they’re doing?”\n\nI had just uninstalled the app and was about to reinstall it. I told him, “You don’t have to talk to me like that,” and he kept cussing me out. My team lead overheard and took over the call. I was heated, so I stepped out and took a walk to calm down.\n\nLater, I told my manager I needed the rest of the day off, and he was understanding. He also said he heard the call, confirmed I did everything right, and that they’re reporting it to HR and the CEO. Still, I doubt anything will happen—he’s a doctor and brings in money.  \n\nNot looking for advice or anything just ranting maybe I am in the wrong but idk. My parents and manager says I shouldn’t let stuff like that get under my skin but I’m not used to be talking to like that especially when I’m helping someone. I need to get out of help desk. \n\nUpdate: I want to clear up a few things. I do not work for an MSP — I’m directly employed by the clinic. That means the doctor involved isn’t just some external client; he was my coworker.\n\nAlso, I did not take the entire day off. I only left one hour early.\n\nAfter speaking with management, I learned this isn’t the first time this doctor has acted this way. Management is fully on my side. They’ve already spoken with HR and the Chief Regional Officer (CRO) about the situation.\n\nThey made it clear this incident does not affect my standing with the company in any way. They told me they know my character and how I treat our users. They specifically mentioned I’m typically very calm and professional, and that it takes a lot to get a reaction out of me — so they understood that the doctor must have said something inappropriate.\n\nFor context, the first six minutes of the call were me trying to connect to his laptop using LogMeIn123, which anyone familiar with the tool knows is a standard part of our process.\n\nManagement also let me know the doctor has since apologized.",

I have a hard time understanding something without being able to relate it to something practical that I encounter in day to day life.\n\nI understand that a docker file is the blueprint to create a docker image, docker images can then be used to create many docker containers, which are replicas of the docker images. Kubernetes could then be used to orchestrate containers - this means that it can scale containers as necessary to meet user demands. Kubernetes creates as many or as little (depending on configuration) pods, which consist of containers as well as kubelet within nodes. Kubernetes load balances and is self-healing - excellent stuff.\n\nWHAT DO YOU USE THIS FOR? I need an *actual* example. What is in the docker containers???? What apps??? Are applications on my phone just docker containers? What needs to be scaled? Is the google landing page a container? Does Kubernetes need to make a new pod for every 1000 people googling something? Please help me understand, I beg of you. I have read about functionality and design and yet I can’t find an example that makes sense to me.\n\nEdit: First, I want to thank you all for the responses, most are very helpful and I am grateful that you took time to try and explain this to me. I am not trolling, I just have never dealt with containerization before. Folks are asking for more context about what I know and what I don't, so I'll provide a bit more info.\n\nI am a data scientist. I access datasets from data sources either on the cloud or download smaller datasets locally. I've created ETL pipelines, I've created ML models (mainly using tensorflow and pandas, creating customized layer architectures) for internal business units, I understand data lake, warehouse and lakehouse architectures, I have a strong statistical background, and I've had to pick up programming since that's where I am less knowledgeable. I have a strong mathematical foundation and I understand things like Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, LLMs, Neural Networks, etc. I am not very knowledgeable about software development, but I understand some basics that enable my job. I do not create consumer-facing applications. I focus on data transformation, gaining insights from data, creating data visualizations, and creating strategies backed by data for business decisions. I also have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms, but almost no understanding about networking principles. Hopefully this sets the stage.",

Basically a *staffing incident* recently left us without a lead dev and my name got pulled from the hat to fill in.\n\nAnd the process has just reminded me how easy like 95% of modern development work is. Let me guess, we have to write CRUD methods for a new object type and shove it in the database. Oh, then the offline worker job has to call an API somewhere once a day for each row? Wow, how novel.\n\nThe best part is every time I add a new button to the app which turns some text from red to green, the business jerks me off like I've just invented gzip compression or something. Meanwhile on the infra side no one knows you exist until you're up Saturday morning at 2AM trying to find which asshole pushed an N+1 query on Friday.\n\nMost of all it refreshed my perspective on why devs are so helpless any time they have to touch infrastructure. The scope of dev work is so narrow and context-independent that a verbatim solution probably already exists in 10,000 different stack overflow answers and just needs a find+replace. Now they even have a robot button in VSCode that does that for them.\n\nMeanwhile for infra you get like two systems deep and already you're source-diving some golang repo on github just to figure out what shape of yaml object the system will actually accept. Or `strace`ing a system component so old that Stallman himself might have written it, just to figure out which syscall it's been hanging on for the last hour. If you need help you'd better hope someone on the team has hair grayer than yours, otherwise you're completely out to sea. Because you sure as hell can't google the specific mixture of platform, provider, and runtime that makes up your infrastructure cocktail.\n\nSo the next time a dev says the pipeline is broken because they elected not to read the line that said \"syntax error at shittycode.js line 69\". Or opines on how the infrastructure is unstable because they sunk the database with a one-thousand line query that dodges every index you've ever set. Or suggests that devops is blocking their new paradigm-shifting code release (it adds a circular progress indicator) just because the dependency scanner is red.\n\nTell them \"just put the API methods in the bag, bro.\"",

    "title": "From Unemployed to a $58k IT Job in a Year: My Journey",
    "text": "I wanted to share my story to inspire those of you who feel stuck or are starting from the bottom. A year ago, I was completely unemployed, three months behind on rent, and facing a court order to either pay up or leave my apartment. My life was the very opposite of stable. \n\nI scraped together what I needed to stay in the apartment, and I took a dishwashing job to stabilize myself. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was exactly what I needed to keep going. Around the same time, I heard about the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. I decided to use what little stability I had from dishwashing to focus on earning that certification.\n\nWhen I finished, I started posting about it routinely on LinkedIn. That decision changed everything. A recruiter from Robert Half saw my posts and reached out with an opportunity: a four-month temp contract hanging wireless access points (WAPs) for schools in northeast Ohio—1300 of those. I took the job, did my best, and made sure to keep my resume updated with everything I learned.\n\nBefore that, my only real IT experience was a tech sales job with an ISP a few years back, where I occasionally reset passwords or rebooted modems. Still, I kept networking and applying. Posting updates on LinkedIn led to more opportunities, including one from Randstad. I accepted their offer, but just three days before my start date, it was rescinded because the organization froze all contracting services after their CEO was fired.\n\nThat could’ve crushed me, but I didn’t give up. I kept my resume sharp and continued posting. Eventually, a recruiter from my current organization found me on LinkedIn. They helped me prep for an interview, and I made the most of it. The result? A $58k job with a $3k relocation bonus that I started last month.\n\nThe funny thing is, my experience was minimal—just the Google cert and some AP installations. What got me here was mastering soft skills, learning to interview, and refusing to give up, even when things went sideways.\n\nHere’s what worked for me and might work for you:\n\n1.\tTake the first step, no matter how small – For me, that was a dishwashing job to stabilize my life and the Google cert to build momentum. Do NOT go into the grind saying what you aren’t gonna do. If you wanna bend the situation to your will, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes.\n\t\n2.\tLeverage LinkedIn – Share your journey, post your progress, and connect with recruiters. It works.\n\t\n3.\tStay resilient – Losing that first job offer hurt, but I kept going. Persistence really is key in this field.\n\t\n4.\tFocus on soft skills – You don’t need to know everything about IT right away. Being able to communicate, adapt, and think critically will set you apart.\n\nA year ago, I felt hopeless. Today, I’m in a role with more upward mobility than I ever thought possible, with a stable income and a clear path forward. If you’re struggling, I hope my story shows you that you can fucking do it. It won’t be easy, but if you keep at it, an opportunity WILL break. Good luck. ",

    "title": "Ten rounds of interviews to be asked the same thing two hundred times.",
    "text": "I have to be honest, I’m getting really worn out with the way interview processes are run these days. I just finished ten rounds of interviews, each lasting between an hour and an hour and a half. By the tenth one, I was completely drained. Nearly every round involved the same repetitive questions: *“Tell me about yourself, tell me about your career, tell me about your expertise.”* After repeating myself countless times, I started giving shorter answers simply because I couldn’t keep restating the same points over and over.\n\nThe final interview in particular was exhausting. The interviewer spent almost the entire time pressing me on *“what I’m passionate about,”* rephrasing the same question dozens of times as though trying to trap me in a “gotcha” moment. On top of that, they asked overly abstract architecture questions that are rarely touched in day-to-day practice, things you configure once and then never revisit.\n\nAfter being asked about my “passion” for the fourth time, I finally told him, politely but firmly, that I wasn’t interested in being treated like an intern. After twenty years in this field, I don’t think anyone deserves to be subjected to repetitive, superficial questioning that doesn’t actually evaluate their capabilities.\n\nThe guy’s eyes sank like I had just committed a crime. This only ever happens with people over 40 in corporate environments, I’ve never had these kinds of interactions with younger staff. I honestly don’t know how to bridge that gap anymore, and at this point, I don’t care to try.\n\nWhy is it that people act like work is supposed to be the only thing that defines you? I do my job because it pays well. I work hard to keep it, and I pick up new skills because I have to, not because I “love” doing it. Nobody stays passionate about the same thing after doing it for 15 or 20 years. You deal with the nonsense, push through it, and get the work done. That’s what a job is. If it were truly a passion project, I wouldn’t be getting paid for it.",

    "title": "VP of Tech with 20 Yrs experience, i wanted to offer some advise to those new or looking to get into IT.",
    "text": "I've been browsing through this sub all morning and I've seen a ton of negative posts from burnt-out individuals. This can seem very discouraging to anyone looking to get into IT or new in the industry. This advice is only for those brand new or looking to get into IT.\n\nA single cert (such as A+) unfortunately isn't enough to be put on top of the list of candidates for a position. This is interesting and a bit unfair since, on paper, an A+ is technically more than enough for a level-1 helpdesk position (I personally still have and update my A+).\n\nIf you're looking to appear more well-rounded, skip the A+ and focus on the following:\n\n* **Microsoft 365 Fundamentals**, followed by **AZ900**\n* **Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS)** — focus on **Outlook** first, because it causes the most \"noise\" in a normal office.\n* Maybe add **Azure Fundamentals** or **AWS Cloud Practitioner**.\n\nIf I'm looking to hire an on-site level-1 technician, here’s what I’m looking for (and so are most IT Managers/Directors):\n\n**Appearance:**  \nHow are you dressed? Personally, I'm a metalhead with tattoos and a sleeve — but you'd never tell by looking at me because I cover it. Work isn’t the place to express yourself; it's where you go to make money. At minimum, dress business casual. Hair neat. Smell good. If you don’t know how to dress well (you’d be surprised how many don’t), get help. These days it’s affordable to look good — go to H&amp;M, Express, or any trendy store and ask the younger employees for advice. They’ll likely be more helpful than your relatives or significant other. You don’t need to wear a tie, but get clothes fitted to your body shape. Don’t wear clothes that are super baggy or shirts that are too tight — yes, I see this a lot.\n\n**Small lifehack:** Buy a work outfit and wear it around the house. You’ll get comfortable in it and won’t feel awkward wearing it to work. Dress nicer than your peers in the same position, and you’ll be taken more seriously by managers — I promise.\n\n**Communication:**  \nI want someone with a good demeanor, who’s well-spoken, helpful, and has common sense. This is huge. Friendly, but not overly social. When dealing with office staff, get in, get out — don’t linger. The IT industry has improved a lot but there's still that stereotype of the creepy awkward it guy whos going through your personal pics, just know this is still a thing, don't be that guy.\n\n**Technical Skills:**  \nI prefer someone who’s well-rounded over someone who’s hyper-specialized but unwilling to leave their comfort zone. This is where having a few foundational certs makes a difference. A big part of your job will be putting out small fires — like solving a printer issue or dealing with a dead laptop, RMA, recover data, setup the user with a new device and make it look like the old one did. etc... it depends on your job, but just know the more well rounded you are the better..\n\n**Resourcefulness:**  \nThis is HUGE. It's okay not to know something. What matters is how you handle it. I look for someone who can say, *\"I’m not sure what’s going on, but I’ll get back to you within X time,\"* then takes ownership, researches (whether through escalation or Google), and follows up with a resolution — without needing a babysitter. I hate the micromanaging culture!\n\n**Direction:**  \nIf you’re just getting into IT, you probably don’t know which branch of IT you'll end up in. That’s OK. I used to be a Linux Telecom Engineer before realizing there were better-paying opportunities in finance. Now I work for a Private Equity firm. Why? It pays more — that’s it.\n\n# Some things I wish I did sooner:\n\n* Get a mentor — ideally someone in a high-level position in the field you're aiming for.  for example, in cyber security it would be a CISO, Compliance Officer, etc.\n* If possible, get an internship, even doing low-level work. It’ll show you the path.\n* Talk to successful people in the branch of IT you want to enter. Burned-out people love telling you how bad it is — that’s often a reflection of their own life, not the industry.\n* Mentorship programs at mature companies are GOLD — take advantage.\n\nAvoid negative, salty people. I've read plenty of those comments here. Sure, bad days happen. But I’ll share this: In one of my previous jobs (and still as a consultant doing internal IT assessments and M&amp;A work), I developed a knack for spotting unhappy IT employees — the complacent, lazy, or those who lost their drive. Every profession that pays well requires *continuous* improvement. IT is no different. If you stop learning, someone will pass you by. It’s just how it is.\n\nKnow the difference between **perception and reality**. Some folks lie A LOT on their resumes. Some don’t lie at all. Find the balance. Also understand that **corporate politics will always play a role** in career growth. If you think just being technically good and keeping your head down will land you a $250k salary — you’re mistaken.\n\nPerception matters. That’s why dressing decently and having a well-rounded cert portfolio are important in the beginning. Also, realize that your resume might end up in front of a 25 year old HR person that doesn't know Jack Shit about IT and all she's thinking about is her drama with her bf and how she needs to find an outfit to go have drinks with the girls, **make it easy** for them to put you on the lists of candidates that should be interviewed, and this might mean pay for someone to review your resume but don't overly rely on this either.\n\nThis was supposed to be a short post 😅. If you made it this far and have questions, drop them — I’ll answer as best I can.\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to wrap my head around the few Chatgpt comments, do you think I didn't write this? In a way it's very fascinating because if you cant tell a human being wrote this post then we're all done for in the future lol.  \n",

Howevr, cybersecurity is not an entry level field, and very few people actually graduate and move directly into a JR Sec Analyst/SOC role. It just doesn’t happen. You’re better off doing a 2 year IT program that covers computer science fundamentals/programming from an accredited school, or a 4 year CS degree from a traditional university. If neither of those are an option due to cost or flexibility, then go for certificates from known and reputable vendors - not some random LinkedIn Learning module nobody has heard of..\n3. You’re going to need knowledge across several domains: networking, programming, OS architecture (deep familiarity with Windows, Linux, and macOS internals.. especially command line, file systems, permissions, processes, and memory), incident response, risk management, threat analysis, and much more. Most importantly, soft skills. You will not get hired if people don’t want to work with you.\n\nI just wanted to list these as I feel they are most pertinent to finding a job in cyber security. I work as a Cybersecurity Analyst and have 7 years in IT, and it's PARAMOUNT that you understand the above IMO.\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "I was laid off back in Feb. Spent not even a year with my last employer before I got the dreaded Teams meeting with my boss and HR. Got RIF'd, a measly severance, and escorted out of the building by front desk security. In this economy, might as well be a death sentence.\n\nI feel for you guys who are looking in the current job market, it's hell. They're paying pennies on the dollar, it's all onsite with little to no remote work, mostly contracts. I remember I was almost willing to take a Tier 2 Desktop Analyst position for 25hr cuz I was desperate. I had to burn through my savings, unemployment is a joke. I lost my relationship of three years because of the layoff, (my ex would say otherwise but we mostly argued over finances), couldn't afford repairs for my car, and my cat required surgery ($4000). To add insult to injury, the ex moved out, wanted half of her deposit back and now I had to pay for everything in full for almost half a year. Dude, I was going through it.\n\nAfter 7 months, 24 interviews, hundreds of emails, and thousands of applications, I got the job I was aiming for. IT support for the city public transportation department, and the commute is 12 min. $70k a year, direct to hire, full benefits. I can't tell you how much relief I feel, it's like I got my life back. I owe it in part to this sub, all the tips and questions answered helped me build a decent resume and improve my interview skills. There is a light at the end guys if you're willing to keep the course and put in the work!",

But as you might know, it's incredibly tough for new grads to land a software job right now. So, instead of staying idle, I took an IT support role without any prior experience.\n\nSurprisingly, I've started to really enjoy it! I've found that instead of coding or debugging all day, I prefer dealing with a variety of technologies. One day I might be setting up a physical server, another day I'm handling hosting issues, and the next, I'm knee-deep in Active Directory.\n\nThe only problem was that I worked at a food company, and there weren't any IT professionals I could learn from. But good news! Last week, I received  a job offer from a company that specializes in IT, with a higher salary. I'll be starting in a few weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'll be working with professionals in a company whose core business is IT.  So, it feels like a great step forward for my IT career. The only catch is that it's a shift-based role, meaning I'll sometimes work weekends or even all night. But I think it'll be worth it.\n\nWhat do you all think? Am I on the right track?",

The HR knows this, but since he’s always online and on-call like a bot and listens to everything they say, the CTO loves him, so nothing changes.\n\nSo, what do you guys think?

I kept seeing stories about people landing high-paying tech jobs, but I felt completely left out of that world.\n\n  \nThen I discovered a lesser-known tech career path through something called Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance &amp; Operations (D365 F&amp;O). It is enterprise software that big companies use to manage things like finance, inventory, and supply chain, and they need people who know how to work with it.\n\nWhat surprised me is that these roles (like D365 ERP Analyst or D365 Functional Consultant) are in high demand, often remote, and usually pay 80K-120K. You don't need to be a programmer or have a traditional background, just the right training and a good understanding of how businesses operate.\n\nI followed a structured learning path, practiced with real examples, and got certified. Within a few months, I had my first offer and I've been working in the space ever since. It completely changed my career and income.\n\nIf you're looking for a way into tech that doesn't require coding or a CS degree, I'd highly recommend exploring D365.

    "text": "I recently was trapped in a longer-than-comfortable drive with an in-law around my age in his mid-20s. We're both in IT, although he's a bit more junior and frustrated by his lack of growth at his company. During the ride he couldn't stop talking about a couple of things which inspired me to make this post (as I'm pretty sure this sub inspired him):\n\n*  IT is a dead field with no growth\n* AI is going to take all of our jobs\n* Trades are where it's at! We should all switch careers and get into trucking/plumbing/electrical\n\nHere's the thing - I've worked in trades for over 5 years. What people don't seem to realise is that the *exact same barriers exist*.\n\nMost trades in North America require an **apprenticeship**, and you can’t start an apprenticeship without a sponsor (usually an employer).  \nBut employers often want someone who:\n\n* already has some hands-on experience\n* won’t slow down the job site\n* doesn’t require a lot of training\n* shows up prepared with basic skills\n\n**Sound Familiar?**  \nYou need experience to get experience — kinda like IT?\n\nYes, trade schools are a thing that exist. No, they are not a guaranteed job. Many college grads from mechanic and HVAC programs constantly deal with lack of employment in their fields due to the exact dilemma above.\n\nWorried AI is going to replace you? Become someone that people enjoy having around with skills that either cannot be replicated or are protected by governance that AI cannot touch. \n\nFeel stuck in your position? Study on your own time and level up.\n\n Can't find a job? Hey, we've all been here at some point. The best advice I can give is to level up your soft skills for interviews.\n\nTrades are 100% not a cakewalk. I have injuries from my short stint that I carry with me to this day.

    "title": "Planning to Become a DevOps Engineer in 2025? Here’s What Actually Matters",
    "text": "I see a lot of people jumping straight into Docker and Kubernetes and then wondering why they feel lost. DevOps isn’t just “learn these 5 tools” it’s a mix of mindset, fundamentals, and the right tools at the right time. Here’s a breakdown of how I’d start if I was new in 2025.\n\n1. Learn the Fundamentals First\nBefore you even touch fancy automation tools, make sure you actually understand the stuff you’ll be automating. That means:\n\nLinux basics (file system, processes, permissions, services)\n\nNetworking (IP, DNS, HTTP/S, ports, routing, NAT, firewalls)\n\nSystem administration (users, groups, package management, logs)\n\nBash scripting for automating simple tasks\n\nBasic Python scripting (log parsing, API calls, automation scripts)\n\nIf you can’t explain what happens when you curl a URL or why a service isn’t starting, you’ll struggle later.\n\n2. Version Control and CI/CD Are Core Skills\nEvery DevOps pipeline starts with Git. Learn branching, merging, pull requests, and resolving conflicts.\n\nThen move into CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment). Popular tools:\n\nJenkins\n\nGitLab CI\n\nGitHub Actions\n\nCircleCI\n\nYou don’t just need to “click a deploy button” — understand pipeline stages, automated testing, build artifacts, and how to roll back if something breaks.\n\n3. Containers and Orchestration\nContainers are a big part of DevOps. Start with Docker:\n\nBuild images with Dockerfiles\n\nUse volumes and networks\n\nWork with multi-container apps via Docker Compose\n\nOnce you’re solid there, learn Kubernetes (K8s). Don’t rush this — it’s a lot. Focus on:\n\nPods, deployments, services\n\nConfigMaps and secrets\n\nScaling and rolling updates\n\nIngress and service discovery\n\nYou’ll also want to understand managed K8s services like AWS EKS, Azure AKS, or GCP GKE.\n\n4. Cloud Skills Are Non-Negotiable\nPick one cloud provider to start: AWS, Azure, or GCP. AWS is the most common, but it’s fine to choose based on job market in your area.\n\nLearn:\n\nCompute (EC2)\n\nNetworking (VPC, subnets, security groups)\n\nStorage (S3, EBS)\n\nIAM (roles, policies, least privilege)\n\nThen, learn how to deploy containers or Kubernetes clusters in the cloud.\n\n5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)\nThis is how you make cloud resources repeatable and version-controlled. Terraform is the most popular and works with all major clouds.\n\nLearn how to:\n\nDefine infrastructure in .tf files\n\nUse variables and modules\n\nApply and destroy infrastructure safely\n\nStore state securely\n\n6. Monitoring, Logging, and Alerting\nIf you build and deploy something but can’t see when it’s failing, you’re not doing DevOps.\n\nGet hands-on with:\n\nPrometheus + Grafana for metrics\n\nELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for logging\n\nCloud-native tools like AWS CloudWatch or GCP Stackdriver\n\n7. Security (DevSecOps Basics)\nSecurity is now a core part of DevOps, not an afterthought. Learn to:\n\nScan code for vulnerabilities (Snyk, Trivy)\n\nManage secrets (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)\n\nSecure Docker images\n\nApply IAM best practices\n\n8. Build Real Projects\nDon’t just follow tutorials. Build something end-to-end, like:\n\nA microservice app with Docker\n\nCI/CD pipeline → Docker → Kubernetes → Cloud deployment\n\nTerraform for infra provisioning\n\nMonitoring + logging setup\n\nPush everything to GitHub with a README that explains your setup.\n\n9. Network With the Community\nJoin DevOps communities:\n\nReddit (r/devops, r/kubernetes, r/aws)\n\nCNCF Slack channels\n\nDevOps Discord servers\n\nLocal meetups or conferences\n\nAsk questions, share your progress, and help others.\n\n10. Stay Consistent &amp; Keep Learning\nDevOps tools evolve fast. Even once you land a job, you’ll keep learning. Read blogs, watch KubeCon talks, experiment in your home lab.\n\nIf you start from zero and commit a few hours per week, you could be job-ready in 6–8 months. The key is not to try and master everything at once — build layer by layer, and make sure each new tool you learn connects to something you already understand.\n\nIf you want a well-structured course &amp; resource suggestions to follow this roadmap step-by-step, DM me and I’ll share what worked for me and others breaking into DevOps.",

    "title": "I’m burned out and ready to just quit IT",
    "text": "Apologies, this is a bit long. TL;DR at the bottom.\n\nSome background:\n\nIn 2004-2005, I went to university and majored in music. I lived on campus in the dorms, enjoyed the college life, and made a lot of friends. However, money dried up and honestly, I’d changed music majors several times because I wasn’t sure what I wanted to do in life.\n\nAt the end of 2005, I gave up and came home because I ran out of money and didn’t want to take out student loans when I wasn’t sure what career path I wanted to take yet. My dad sat down with me to discuss this a lot and after a while, we both realized I enjoyed computers and video games and techie stuff. We found a local trade school that offered a six-month training program in computer repair and networks. I signed up for the course, got through it, got my CompTIA A+ and my HTI+ certs. \n\nAs part of the program, I had to find an internship with a local employer for five months to finish the program. I got on with the local state university IT dept and from there things really blossomed. I impressed the CIO with my work ethic and fast learning and he eventually offered me a full time role there as a field tech for the campus. \n\nI worked there for ten years, enjoying sharply discounted tuition as I got my bachelor’s degree in IT non-traditionally, and lived with my folks who graciously let me live there to save on housing expense. I went from field tech, to application packager, to server tech, to data center guy, to network tech. Graduated ten years later debt-free, car paid off. All good. 👍🏻 \n\nGot my first post-college private sector job with a medium-size corp two hours north of home. Loved it there. Started as an entry level one EUC engineer with their EUC team. Did Windows MDM, MacOS MDM, Citrix management, VMware, O365, etc. All fun stuff to learn and do. The culture was great for a medium-sized corp, honestly. I had a lot of ”go go go” energy to grow there and I grew to a senior system engineer role. \n\nThis…is where things started to change however. One day, during the hiring boom of 2021, we lost a ton of people to other companies offering more money for better jobs. I and a handful of folks stayed. I was offered and kind of pushed by our director to take a management role because he said he thought I could handle it, and others had given him feedback about me where they were sure I’d make a great leader…so I reluctantly accepted it. \n\nWhat followed was three years of middle management hell. Nothing I ever did was good enough or made anyone happy. I went to bat for my team constantly, fighting for raises and promotions and even just to give good feedback. HR constantly gave me “Bell Curve” crap excuses and told me to lie about performances so they could satisfy that requirement. People began to leave and I was the one stuck between a rock and a hard place, unable to affect any change. This is where I started to break down emotionally at home after work. \n\nThen came the day we were bought out by a major global corporation. Things went from bad to worse quickly and no matter what I did to defend my team and alarms I sounded loudly to everyone even our new VP, I was ignored. I was breaking down at home nightly at this point and my team had gone from ten to just four people. We were all that was left of the original company’s IT. \n\nI eventually had a former work colleague get me a referral to a role at a prestigious cancer center as a manager over their email team. I applied, interviewed, and started that Monday following my last day at the previous place. Only a weekend between to breathe. This job destroyed me mentally. The director ruled with her emotions and it felt like she’d just hired me to be her new punching bag. Eventually, a personal matter arose for my family (my folks) that was severe enough that I made the tough decision to resign from that job. But it left me very jaded towards management work and I’ll NEVER do that again. Ever. Management work is dead to me. \n\nFast forward a couple weeks with no employment, focusing on taking care of family while applying everywhere in the meantime, and I get connected with a personal friend who works for a small MSP (70 people in total). He gets me a referral and I apply and get a job as a fully remote level three engineer. At first it starts off well as I enjoy getting back to technical work, answering tickets and helping fix things, enjoying the teamwork culture we had. Then I start to see leadership slash away what made the place great, the teamwork slowly dissolves, walls come up, and siloing begins to happen. Raises and promotions don’t exist here anymore and annual bonuses are now peanuts. Late nights and lost weekends are common. Being on-call means no freedom for a whole week. Even as a level three tech, I’m taking frontline calls for “someone’s broken headset” or “reboot this server please” even if it’s 2am and I’m trying to sleep. \n\nAll the tickets I get handed are heavy hitter, multi-day tickets, that of course have everyone’s attention. Senior brass are watching my tickets like hawks and talking to customers about me behind my back to see how well I’m doing. My boss is constantly defending and pushing back because he knows my tickets are extremely complicated to deal with. \n\n\nFast forward to today (I’m now 39m):\n\nI wake up each morning, tired, barely slept. The LAST thing I want to do is stare at computer screens all day. My weight has been an issue lately, BP is constantly up, and my “go go go” energy is gone. I don’t give a rip about tickets or customers or anything. Every day feels mechanical, lifeless, and numb. I just want to pack a bag, get in my car, and drive away, and not look back. \n\nIT is not the “exciting, challenging, diverse career” I was told it would be all those years ago. I’ve been all over the place in this industry over those years and….I’m not sure I want to do it anymore. It’s just more staring at screens all day, dealing with thankless work where I’m considered a black hole cost center rather than an asset no matter how hard I work. \n\nI need some advice on where to go with this. What am I missing? How do I get that energy back for this work? Or is it too late and I need to find another career path? \n\n\nTL;DR: I spent almost 18 years in IT, and I just don’t care anymore. Am I burned out on IT and how do I deal with this?",

Pass AWS Certificate?\"\n\n4 years later the field is objectively is fucked up.  \nI run the market analysis based on Linkedin postings every month and for last 6+ months is more and more DevOps becoming a full stack engineer. Programming used to be optional for devops now its not, highest requested skill in Job descriptions Python, even Golang is showing up in 28% of job postings, not that may or may not be in your local area, but I run this all regions.\n\nI had a co-worker who told me openly that he become DevOps cuz \"its easy and he doesn't need programming.. a simple transition for him from Customer service into DevOps\".\n\nMost of those folks of 2020-2021 wave now frustrated that the job market is non-existent. It is non existent if don't know your craft well. Can you write a simple round robin load balancer in any language that is using sockets without AI? it could be as short as 20 lines of code.. that need both network knowledge and programming, I guarantee that 9/10 of Engineers will be clueless to how even start implementing it, yet ask anyone and they want to get 100K+\n\nIf you are looking or planning to look for a job, please stop racking up certificates, everyone and their mother has AWS, Kubernetes, and list goes on certificates THEY (almost) DON'T HAVE VALUE. now allegedly non-profit Linux Foundation made another abomination of money grab called  Kubeastronaut, what a shitshow..\n\nGuys I don't want to bring anyone down, I recently started looking for a new job and luckily I could get interviews and offers despite the market so what I'm trying to say is just upskill but in a right way. Don't be fooled by marketing machine of AWS or other Cert provider. The same time you spend on that you can easily spend to master Bash scripting, or Networking which carries much more value.\n\nPick up hard skills, become a balanced engineer who know entire process and you will be fine regardless of Bad or Good market:  \nNetworking, OS  \nProgramming  \nDSA (you should know at least how to approach Easy questions)  \nCloud architecture patterns (check AWS Architects blog)  \nEvent driven architectures  \nand list goes on, but for Gods sake don't get another AWS SAA cert and call it a day.  \n..\n\nif you need more data here is the [market analysis](https://prepare.sh/trends/devops) for May 2025.",

    "title": "FINAL UPDATE: Bosses are about to learn the hard way what some MSPs are really like",
    "text": "Previous Posts: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1i7ndbl/bosses_are_about_to_learn_the_hard_way_what_some/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ly99ml/update_bosses_are_about_to_learn_the_hard_way/)\n\nTLDR for previous parts: I worked at a nonprofit as head of a 2-man IT department with the other guy being strictly helpdesk with no desire for more responsibility. Management contracted a local MSP to \"help\" with cybersecurity and IT. From my perspective, we weren't getting anywhere close to the value of what we paid them per month, but the MSP was able to convince upper management to continue to spend more money. Not necessarily looking to leave, an opportunity arose and I put my notice in.\n\nMy notice period went by pretty quietly. I offboarded what I could to who I could, but there were several compliance related duties I did that required a dedicated, competent employee to take over. Bosses wanted the MSP to take these over, the MSP didn't want to take them over (don't blame them, it doesn't make sense for an MSP to do it), and in the end they delegated it to the helpdesk guy for a whopping $1 more an hour.\n\nThey also volun-told the helpdesk guy that he would be taking on more of my responsibilities, including a schedule change and being available for calls outside of his working hours. I feel bad for him as his financial situation doesn't give him much choice in declining these responsibilities. \n\nThe MSP wasted no time in convincing upper management to allocate my salary to more projects. The servers that aren't even 4 years old will be replaced with new servers for over twice the price of what was originally paid ($10k --&gt; $20k+). The remaining Cisco/Meraki equipment that isn't even 2 years old will be replaced with Unifi. They finally got the SonicWall firewall configured properly after 6 months, just in time for the SSLVPN vulnerability to be announced. \n\nI was never given a counteroffer to stay; I'd like to say I was surprised, but I wasn't. They did ask if they could contract services with me to offer assistance if the helpdesk guy or the MSP ran into something that wasn't documented or unique to the environment. I was open to it so long as they understood my new job took priority; both upper management and the MSP spoke about this with me. Eventually, they dropped the topic altogether so I don't know if there was an epiphany somewhere or what, but I'm not disappointed either way. \n\nI'm a few weeks into my new job. I love it. It's fully remote, I have a lot of autonomy, my boss is well-experienced, and I don't have to worry about being a jack-of-all-trades. I reached out to the helpdesk guy at my old job to ask how he was doing. He still hasn't gotten his $1 raise and is spoken to like a child much of his time. I feel for him. He'll either have to learn a lot quickly or find a new job. \n\nDespite everything I've written about my old job, I didn't hate it. I learned a lot and had a lot of freedom. My coworkers respected me, but I had grown as much as I was going to. Hiring an MSP was just the cherry on top of motivating me to leave. There won't be another update as I can't imagine anything else happening. Thanks to everyone who followed this so far and for all the support! To all the SMB sysadmins out there, never stop learning and beware the MSPs!",

Now there are 13,000.\n\nI started in 2021 as a freshman in college and got a 'IT generalist' job instantly at a local company with zero experience by just making some HTML/CSS website as my resume. I then somehow got hired at a local hospital system as a network specialist for a network engineering team while having zero network experience and a very surface level understanding of networking and got on the job training to the CCNP level by a great mentor there. My homelab was basically the test environment of an enterprise network of 5 hospitals. I learned an incredible amount here, especially because of the senior guy who mentored me.\n\nA year or so after that, I moved onto becoming an SRE for a big national company and then a year after that, I'm somehow now an SWE for a big tech company. I count my blessings everyday.\n\nSomeone on Reddit back then told me to not wait for junior year internships and just apply for full on careers even as a freshman with no experience. I said screw it, why not. The entire career questions subreddit's were basically \"yeah just learn Python at home and in 10 months you'll get a job\". There was zero doom and gloom on the front pages.\n\nI said screw it, it can't hurt. I ended up with a full time job my first semester in college and had to drop my in person classes and transition to online for the rest of my degree. It was just a crazy job market back then.",

    "text": "TL;DR: Work your hours, clock out. Go home. Your family loves you. \n\nTonight, my friends, family, and current senior manager loved me enough to confront me about my ambition and work-life balance, which are leading me to an early grave.\n\nAfter dropping out of college and feeling humiliated, I spent years figuring life out, eventually leading me to IT. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was a sysadmin and fell into an Azure rabbit hole. Living alone during the stay-at-home orders, I initially devoted 2-3 hours of professional development after work, but my ADHD hyper-focus turned it into 8-10 hours, not including workday hours.\n\nI stormed through my expert 365 admin cert and developed extensive Azure GCC experience. I discovered that the suites loved shiny dashboards and learned to survive on 4 hours of sleep, embracing a dangerous mindset I called “total commitment.” Two months later, I was rocking and abusing my Power BI certification.  \n\nI quadrupled my salary in two years, earning an exceptional salary band even by D.C. standards. However, I ignored warning signs like surging blood pressure, massive hair loss, and fatigue, thinking I needed more discipline. I started sleeping only every other day.\n\nLast year, I completed an ERP project a month early and received an outstanding bonus, professional clout rose. The next day, I randomly fell unconscious for three hours and was hospitalized for a week. I lied at work, said I had a home emergency, and worked everyday from the hospital from my phone, drs advice be damned.\n\nToday, I finished a successful week integrating systems and closing projects early, it only took 80 hours this week. No biggie. My friend invited me to dinner tonight, and to my surprise,my parents (who live 5 hours away), my boss (who secretly logged my work hours), and friends I hadn’t seen in years were there.\n\nThe end result was a very painful conversation, I am on a mandatory leave of absence for three months, and a father who admitted he already prepared his heart to bury his son early. I am absolutely devastated, lost, confused, but most importantly grateful.\n\nThe DC rat race is real and I almost became its latest victim. I am more than my career, my accomplishments are not my “crown” and most importantly, f******************ck the hell out of c-suite approval. \n",

    "text": "\n\nFirst, I fully acknowledge that I may have just gotten lucky through this process, but I also feel that I definitely put in a lot of work to progress my skills faster. \nLong story short, loyalty to a company is dead nowadays. \nI only have (coming up on) a year in the IT industry with just one cert(Sec+)and I have job hopped 3 times in that time. \nI started at $48k for my first job, help desk. After 5 months, I found another help desk job for $62k. Then, 3 months later, I found another role as  system administration role for $80k, then 3 months later, I just now accepted an offer for $100k in networking. \n\nThe things I PERSONALLY feel made made me excel were only small things that compounded. \nFirst, I would always ask what project to be put on that could be improved. Things like bench stock inventory, software documents, or any additional duty. Something that is big enough to show you really made a difference, but not so big you’re in over your head. This gave me something to do in my down time and made me always look busy. I’d always gone a very brief weekly update without being asked to show that I’m still working it, the progress I made, and what I had planned next week. This can show your skills like organization, initiative, and willingness to learn. \nSecond, cross training and finding single points of failure within the desk or job. Someone doesn’t have a secondary for an additional duty, help them out. Only one person knows how to do a specific job, ask to learn. This helps you meet and get to know your cowriters, learn the job better, and help the team. For me, this helped me bond with coworkers via work and not small talk because I’m an introvert and hate that. \nLastly, I took my time with applying to jobs. I applied to only 2-3 a week, but I tailored my resume to each one and made sure I met all or most requirements. Tailoring my resume started giving me about an 85% response rate vs just mass applying. I can’t stress how much this helps. \nThis wasn’t a bragging post, but just something I wanted to share to see if it helps something else and to let them know that it’s possible to speed run the salary ladder to decent pay. \n\nThere’s more I felt I did and I’d be happy to explain if you want more tips.

    "title": "I am the IT department. How do I tactfully negotiate a raise?",
    "text": "I'm in my mid-twenties. For the last seven years, I've been a one-man show for a contract manufacturing facility with about 50 employees. I happen to know from some old tax docs I stumbled across that the company was worth \\~20M a few years ago, and it's only increased in value since then. Point being, this isn't some small, \"mom and pop\" operation. We've got parts on Mars.\n\nI am the entirety of my company's IT department. I do everything. If it involves a computer in any way, it's my responsibility. IT management, systems admin, network engineering, technical support, and lately, information security (more on that later).\n\nSome days all I do is reboot computers. Other times I'm negotiating with ISPs to run new fiber lines to our building or working with a web developer to redesign our company website, and other times I've got my head in the ceiling running cable to the new WAPs I researched, purchased, and installed myself, in order to support the boss's initiative of installing tablets on every CNC mill (I had to design that integration too).\n\nI can say with confidence that there is nobody else on staff who could even remotely do my job. I don't think anyone on staff even understands my job, or the true scope of what I do here.\n\nConsidering I'm a massive single point of failure, (at my insistence) we maintain a contract with an MSP who acts as my backup in case I get hit by a bus, but their involvement is minimal. They keep an eye on the server to ensure I'm not messing anything up and I reach out to them for advice every once in a while when I don't know how to do something, but that's about it. I handle 99% of day-to-day operations, as well as a lot of business management stuff that wouldn't be the MSP's responsibility.\n\nI make $30/hr. Same as what I started at when I assumed this position in 2018. I haven't gotten a raise in seven years despite the exponential increase in my responsibilities (when I first started, I as just meant to provide in-house tech support).\n\nWhile I was grateful for that kind of salary at the time, I can't help but feel now that I'm a little undervalued.\n\nWhat's more, management has been pushing for CMMC compliance lately since many of our clients are government. We're in the early stages and we've been working with some capable consultants who've been super helpful, but they won't stick around forever. When they leave, maintaining our InfoSec compliance will fall on me since there's nobody else on staff with the background to handle it and I know management won't want to spend the money on a full time InfoSec manager.\n\nTo be clear, I don't mind the workload. I'm ADHD and easily bored, so the fact that my job is different every day, that I'm always working on cool and exciting new projects is why I've been able to hold down this job for this long. I find it engaging and fulfilling and that's why I've tolerated being underpaid for years. In the past, I didn't want to risk rocking the boat with management and jeopardize a job I enjoy because I got greedy.\n\nThat said, I don't know if I can afford to undersell myself anymore. CoL keeps getting higher, and I'm already doing so much for so little and now management wants me to start handling all our InfoSec compliance too. I like my job, but I'm starting to feel that I'm getting taken advantage of.\n\nOn the other hand, I also know the tech job market is rough right now and in some ways I'm grateful to have a job in my field at all, so now more than ever I'm fearful of disrupting my stability by asking for too much.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or guidance for me?\n\nI feel like I've got some powerful leverage. I have lost track of the number of critical systems that are wholly reliant on me, and this InfoSec stuff management is pushing onto me is necessary to secure lucrative defense contracts in the future (and retain a number of our existing clients).\n\nThat said, I don't want my bosses to feel like I'm holding their network hostage as a negotiation technique, since I feel that would immediately turn things hostile. Nor do I want to be fired for refusing to take on more work for no additional pay.\n\nSo, what would you do in this situation? How do I advocate for myself in a way that appeals to the owner's best interests instead of threatening them? Any words of wisdom from other IT pros would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Thank you all for the feedback, I'm grateful.

They have a way more ridged timesheet.\n\nI decided to simply stretch my hours and secretly do them while on the clock.\n\nTo simply explain my hours and timesheet, the company demands we document and charge 50 working hours. HR desires me to add in my training to the end. Effectively if I completed the training in a week, I would have 60 hours charged.\n\nExample:\n\nMonday  \n2 hrs - Project 1  \n2 hrs - Project 2, etc  \n2 hrs - Administrative Meeting  \n1 hrs - IT Meetings  \n1 hrs - Training L1/L2 Support  \n2 hrs - L3 Support\n\nSo I'll just add 0.5 to 2 hrs of training a day but actually do the training during Projects and pretended like I spent that long on them because really I'm the only one on those projects.",

    "title": "25% salary to hourly: cut due to \"economic changes within our industry\"",
    "text": "Due to \"economic changes within our industry\" my employer has been making adjustments.   \n  \nUnfortunately, my position has been affected. As a result, my job title will change from IT Administrator/Manager to Network Administrator to better align with my updated responsibilities \"linux servers\".   \n  \nAdditionally, my employment status will shift from exempt, salaried to non-exempt, hourly, with an equivalent hourly rate of my current salary and my weekly hours will be reduced by 25%. \n\nMy benefits package, including health, life, and disability insurance, will remain unchanged, but my PTO will be prorated accordingly.  \n  \nAs a non-exempt employee, I will now be required to clock in and out for work, including meal breaks, and track my hours for any remote work, etc. I'm sure everyone here knows how this works.  \n  \nI might be able to handle another 6 to 9 months of this depending on the math on my expenses and new pay work out, but I am told I can get partial unemployment with the California EDD here.\n\nI feel like with my 8+ years experience in IT and DevOps, I have had the opportunity to manage large-scale environments, from 5K+ Mac clients, Linux, and the occasional Windows system, as well as implement automation solutions on 10K system server farms that I have a good amount of knowledge to offer. ( I hate to brag and feel like I suck at it too )  \n  \nI know the economy in this industry right now isn't the best and I don't know everything or might be a little lower skilled compared to others of my peers who are more focused on knowing one single thing, or really much good at random programming problems to screen candidates with. I &amp; my fully dependent family member deserve to be comfortable even if that's nearly paycheck to paycheck with a small amount left over in savings. \n\nGiven the circumstances, can I eat the hit now and then resign in a couple months and take full unemployment later depending on how things math out, Say in a month or two while I focus full time on finding a new job? Should I say I thought about it and resign now at the end of the week? \n\nThanks for the advice ahead of time and letting me rant here. :)",

    "title": "HR told me I should quit",
    "text": "Hey folks,  \nThrowaway for normal reasons. I need to get this off my chest and maybe hear if others have been through similar.\n\nI relocated country (EU) for what seemed like a promising hybrid sysadmin role at a mid-sized company. The job was advertised as hybrid, the salary was good, and I was excited. The CEO personally signed off on my relocation package, and I had a good feeling about the company overall.\n\nBut the reality has been brutal.\n\nFrom day one, my direct manager (let’s call him “T”) has been cold, rigid, and toxic. He micromanages obsessively, contradicts himself constantly. When a close family member of my partner passed away, I asked if he minds that I WFH to support her — his response? “I do mind.” That was it. No empathy, no follow-up, no human decency. Other employees in the company work remotely without issue. When I asked why I couldn’t, the excuse kept changing — from “I can’t defend more than one WFH day” (Defend from who? No idea.) to “IT needs to be onsite,” then “the company doesn’t offer remote or hybrid,”(It does) and finally “your job is full-time, not hybrid” even though the job ad literally said hybrid he tried gaslighting me that full time jobs cant be hybrid... \n\nWhen my performance review came around, key projects I had led — including a full Webex rollout, IVR config, and call routing and forwarding that took weeks — weren’t even mentioned. He just said I hadn’t met expectations on 3 things I missed over the course of a year. No coaching, no feedback at the time of, just more responsibilities dumped on me and then used against me later.\n\nSince our service desk role was cut, I’ve been doing both that and my main job. When I asked for flexibility or help, I was told the service desk “runs itself” — but also that I couldn’t WFH because the service desk needs someone onsite. Which is it?\n\nHR seemed receptive when I raised concerns at first. They even suggested a 2-day WFH week trial to him — but he changed his mind without telling me or them. At the latest meeting, I was just *told* that I wouldn’t be getting the second WFH day. No discussion. No Compromise. When I pointed out that I’m already burning out and that I *need* the flexibility to improve my performance, he said I need to *perform better first* before I get the second day. Like asking a plant to grow before watering it. I am so fucking tired.\n\nI feel like I’m being managed out — like they’re not outright firing me, just slowly pushing me to the edge. HR advised I start looking for a role that better meets my needs (so quit). They hinted they might waive my relocation repayment fee, so at this point it feels like they’re leaving the door open for me.\n\nThe rest of the company? Amazing. I genuinely enjoyed working with the other teams. But T has completely poisoned the well. I've put so much effort into this job, learned the systems, supported users, picked up others’ slack. And now I’m being squeezed out just for asking to be treated like a human being.\n\nI've got some hopeful interviews lined up, one in final stages for a fully remote role that would be an ideal fit. But the damage this place has done to my confidence and mental health… it's going to take a while to bounce back. My only silver lining is that T is going to drown in the work left for him ***when*** my role is empty. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far. If you’ve been through similar, I’d love to hear how you handled it. I feel exhausted, angry, and just really fucking disappointed. \n\n**Warning to younger techs:**  \nIf, like I was, you are early in your IT Support career and lucky enough to have decent management, supportive culture — *do not romanticize moving to “the customer side” for more ownership or technical freedom*. The grass isn't greener, it's just turf over a minefield. Don't end up like me: total responsibility, no support, no trust, and no way out but through. Learn from my pain and trust your guy when the red flags fly — don’t find out the hard way. \n\n— Burned Out Sysadmin",

    "text": "Guys, I'm here sitting on my back yard on a beautiful Saturday and I am about to sign an offer letter with a Fortune 500 company — with a 25% salary increase.\n\nBut just a few months ago, I was getting rejected from interviews that didn’t even last 10 minutes. I was so embarrassed on how bad I did on the interviews. With over a decade in IT — supporting Windows and Linux systems, solving tough problems, and holding a high-level security clearance — I thought I had a solid foundation. But in the world of DevOps, I kept hearing the same message:\n\n“You don’t have enough experience.”\n\n“You’re not worth senior-level DevOps pay.”\n\nAnd ironically, being a high earner already seemed to work \\*against\\* me.\n\nI was turned down from at least eight interviews. Some didn’t even give me a chance to speak. I started doubting myself — hard.\n\nSo when another recruiter reached out, I told her:\n\n\"I don’t want to waste your team’s time. My background might not align.\"\n\nShe said:\n\n\"Actually, we really like what we see. Let’s get you in front of the hiring manager.\"\\_\n\nAfter the first interview with the \\*\\*hiring manager\\*\\*, I asked for \\*\\*two weeks\\*\\* to prepare for the technical round — not to delay, but because I was \\*determined\\* not to fail again.\n\nAt that point, I didn’t even have a home lab. But I went all in.\n\nIn those two weeks:\n\n\\- Built a full homelab from scratch\n\n\\- Deployed the Sock Shop app using ArgoCD\n\n\\- Provisioned infrastructure with Terraform\n\n\\- Set up monitoring with \\*\\*Prometheus, Grafana, and Kuberhealthy\\*\\*\n\n\\- Studied nonstop for a HackerRank I had never heard of\n\n\\- \\*\\*Watched DevOps interview Q&amp;A videos on YouTube while driving — even while taking my dog to the vet\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\*\\*Skipped volleyball — something I love — and turned down social invites from friends just to stay locked in\\*\\*\n\nThe \\*\\*technical interview was round 2 of 4\\*\\*, but after one hour of walking through my setup, architecture, and decisions — they said:\n\n\"We’re skipping the rest. We're making you an offer.\"\\_\n\nThat moment changed everything.\n\n\\*\\*My clearance didn’t get me here. My title didn’t. My past salary didn’t.\\*\\*\n\nBut \\*grit, sacrifice, and proof of ability\\* did.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? I’ll get to \\*\\*work from home eventually\\*\\* — a goal I’ve had for years.\n\nTo anyone trying to break into DevOps:\n\nDon’t wait until you’re “ready.”\n\n\\*\\*Start building, start learning, and never stop showing up.\\*\\*\n\nYour breakthrough might be closer than you think.\n\nSorry English isn't my first language and I use ChatGPT to help me with this but it's truly my experience.  So good luck out there, if I can make it, you can!!!! Cheers!!! ",

I could tell in the interview for the Sr. Network Engineer position that I had been pegged as an \"Operations guy\" given that I worked at an MSP for 15 years. \n\nIt's a little tragic, as it makes me feel like I'm an MSP guy for life.  I've done countless upgrades, planning for such upgrades, compatibility checks and advisement on other products that need to come in-line on versioning, brought up new call centers, sunset others... I've done it all, so it's really depressing to hear the remark \"Ah, so you're an operations guy\" and the next day hear they aren't interested in continuing. Bah.\n\nFor me, maintaining income and avoiding unemployment was paramount. I was able to secure a new role with less, but relatively comparable salary as I had previously, and I accepted the job offer about 3-3.5 weeks after I was let go. I was amazed I was able to get into a place that quickly.\n\nAt any rate, it's back to MSP land for me.

    "title": "We're waiting 3+ months for a software vendor to tell us if they will support their product on Windows Server 2025",
    "text": "We replaced an on-prem server last fall.  Simple setup with a VM as DC and a VM as File/Print/Application server.  Both run Server 2025.  There is also a totally separate LOB application that the software vendor says must run on a dedicated  VM.\n\nFor 3+ months we have been asking the vendor if they will support running on Windows Server 2025.  They either don't respond at all or say that they will get back to us.  And they never do.  Meanwhile, we continue to run the application on 2012r2 which violates the cyber insurance coverage mandating \"only supported O/Ss\"\n\nLast week I sent another email to the vendor's senior engineer asking about 2025 support.  The response was \"We don't have any customers running it and we haven't tested it.  But will ask the Dev team to follow up.\"  So you're telling me that customers aren't running the software on an O/S that you refuse to test.  Imagine that.\n\nThe vendor has been growing by leaps and bounds and the original owners sold a majority stake to Private Equity.  Since then the support has gone downhill.  The usual story.\n\nIf we have to revert to Server 2022 I guess we will but that seems dumb. Has anyone here seen an application that was OK on Server 2022 but won't run properly on Server 2025?  Looking for some advice.   TIA.\n\nEditing my post to add some context, which I think is important because I'm seeing so many comments that are critical because \"You let things get so bad.\"\n\n\\* This is local government where a Mayor and Council, none of whom have an IT background set the annual budget.   There are two budgets each years: an operating budget, which covers things like salaries, utilities, insurance, etc. and a a second budget for what are called \"capital projects\" that are for new equipment (police cars, truck for public works, and just about anything IT related that costs more than a couple of hundred dollars).\n\n\\* I have no direct contact with the Mayor and Council.  Each year I put in a request to the Town's Administrator who puts together my requests along with the requests for every other department (Police, Public Works, Recreation, Senior Services, etc.) into a spreadsheet of projects.\n\n\\* In mid-2021 I was notified by the server manufacturer that the only server we have (outside of the Police Department, which has its own equipment) would not be eligible for a hardware maintenance agreement after 2022.  In addition, the server was maxed out on storage bays and was running an O/S that was going end-of support in 2023 which would be in violation of the Town's cyber insurance coverage.  All of these factors combined caused me to make a new server and O/S a top priority for 2022.\n\n\\* In 2022 the Town opened a new municipal building that went WAY over the original budget for a variety of reasons including Covid era price increases.  Each department was told that most capital requests for 2022 would be denied.  The server project was nixed.\n\n\\* At the end of 2022, I put the server into the budget request for 2023 citing the same reasons as I did the prior year, this time indicating that the server would already be operating without a hardware maintenance agreement and unless they wanted to take a chance that the server could be down for days (or longer) if there was an equipment failure they really needed to approve the project for 2023.\n\n\\* In 2022, the local election caused a shift in control from one party to the other.   The Town Administrator, who can be fired without cause and was brought in by the party that lost the election, was concerned that he was going to lose his job.\n\n\\* When the Town Administrator put together the list of capital project requests for 2023, he didn't include the server project at all, possibly in an attempt to show how fiscally responsible he was in hopes of saving his job.  He was fired anyway and a new Administrator was hired.\n\n\\* I again pleaded my case for new hardware and software in 2023 to be included in the 2024 budget.  The new Administrator agreed to put the project into the capital budget request for 2024 and that budget was approved late summer/early fall of that year.  There is a statutory waiting period of 4+ weeks before approved money can actually be spent and I was finally given approval to get a purchase order for the new server.  Delivery of the server was in late 2024, almost 3 years after I made it clear that replacing the server was a top priority.\n\n\\* One more fun fact: the \"new\" Administrator was fired and a new person was hired earlier this year.\n\nFun times working in this environment for sure.",

    "text": "**Holy crap, this is long. Congratulations to anyone who reads the whole fuckin thing. We're all narcissists on social media, but this might be a bit much.**  \n**If you're using this to help you go to sleep, you're welcome - let me know how far you made it!**  \n  \n  \nSo, I've got wind that my boss's boss, a new guy, wants to reduce my salary and probably get rid of me. He doesn't know me. He's new. He's not tried to get to know anybody or anything about how we do things, because he's a PE placement whose sole goal is to do whatever it takes to make Line Go Up so they can all get a bit richer in 3-4 years.\n\nI used to run the place, more or less. Seven years ago, I took on a job as a 'Senior Sysadmin' in a team that was one enthusiastic-but-past-it 60-year-old helpdesk person who spent more time cleaning the office than doing IT work, and my boss, our head of IT, Security and Facilities, who was desperately overworked and spread thinner than when you really want a nice piece of toast, but you've run out of butter so you're really scraping up those end pieces to try and .... you get where I'm going.\n\nThey had barely anything. A serviceable network and a datacenter of \\~13 racks (horribly managed, engineers would go in and do what they wanted, the cabling was a disaster) gave Engineering 'sort of' what they needed, but all the departments hated IT and worked around them. No asset management because the helpdesk person had sorted the Excel sheet wrong, saved it over the top of the old one, and not realized for weeks, and so now it was all fucked.  \nThe end user environment was a joke - manually built machines, barely any management (GPOs), no management at all on the Macs. A partial rollout of SentinelOne. People were still using 'Password123' as their passwords because they'd never had to change them.\n\nI went in and rolled up my sleeves. Six months in, my boss quit, and I was given the 'department', with our head of security promoted to CISO/CIO above me. We had already migrated everyone to Intune-joined Windows machines. I'd built a custom asset management system in Quickbase and assessed our whole estate. People had changed their fucking passwords. I was pulling SSO-capable systems into Azure for SSO, which was going down a treat. We had Duo for MFA. We'd migrated to Webex (not my decision - I was given 4 days to do it in the first week back after Christmas, after my boss had fallen out with GoToMeeting).  \nWe were even making progress with other departments.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention that, during this time, I was commuting several hundred miles each week (by plane and bus) and staying on a futon in my boss's barn. I guess I really wanted out of my old job and saw potential here, but man, I was paying for it (literally, because the company did not pay for the travel costs). I should probably also mention that, at the time, I was in the US on an H1-B visa. It was an L1-B, this place paid to change it to employ me. So I was sort of tied to them now. It's also relevant later.\n\nAfter my boss quit and I took on a management position, my partner and I moved to be closer to the office. I had already uprooted my life by moving to the US in the first place, but it was a big deal for her, the first time she'd moved away from family (which turned out to be a good thing).\n\nWe started implementing Jamf Pro just before COVID hit in 2020, so I spent the first couple of months alternately developing a new Mac build and planning out the enrollment of our existing estate, with designing and building a new service desk in JSM (or JSD as it was). This job was giving me a crash course in all sorts of things. My background was in helpdesk and sysadmin for firmly on-premise systems. SaaS was the product my previous employers built, not something I used.\n\nBut now, almost everything was in the cloud. The first few years of this job were, quite frankly, fucking great. It's awful to say, but I enjoyed the pandemic because I had the time and space to sit and learn new things and implement them all, **and get paid for it at home**.\n\nSadly, whilst *my* pay slowly increased, the funding for competent team mates was lacking. I had built out everything we needed to run a really successful, scalable IT department to grow the company (we grew by about 400 in my time there). But I needed good people to run with me, and I could only ever afford juniors who I never had the time to teach, and who were not good self-starters.\n\nMy time became more and more 'managerial' as it was supposed to, but I was also still the senior sys admin, the senior helpdesk, the senior infrastructure guy. I had one fantastic hire who became my infrastructure guy, and I often thanked Cthulu for him, because he did make a meaningful difference in a good way. Everybody else sucked ... or I did.\n\nI've always had imposter syndrome, but doing this job made it crushing. Not only was I rapidly learning, designing, and implementing systems I'd never come across before in a rapidly growing business that never wanted to hear 'No', but I was a manager with zero experience and zero support from the company. I had to fire my first hire after a series of fuck ups, and we sat in the HR manager's office whilst she said nothing, and **I had to fire the poor fucking guy** when I had no idea what to even say. Apparently, I 'did a great job' according to HR, for whatever that's worth 🙂‍↔️\n\nWhen I joined, the plan was a 5-year ramp-up to a team lead position, then manager. That was accelerated to six months, and then I leapt on the treadmill and didn't stop.\n\nI questioned myself *constantly*. Nobody could ever make a decision on anything, no matter how many guidelines we laid down, processes we wrote, or procedures we implemented.\n\nMy boss was not much help. He was (and still is) a lovely guy with tons of industry experience in a lot of different roles. But he's a people pleaser and always tries to make things work. Sadly that leads to a lot of people taking advantage and, as a result, whilst I had someone behind me who would always back me up in a bad situation, for things like 'Getting department heads to agree to something we need them to do' or 'Get us more money before we all kill ourselves', he was kind of terrible.  \nHe repeatedly told me I was doing an awesome job, kept promoting me and giving me more money, but none of it did anything to quiet the voices, nor get me the help that I actually needed!! (I said on more than one occasion, pay me less to get someone good).\n\nJust when things were really ramping up, I found out that I was going to be temporarily unemployed for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nI was applying for my Green Card, and whilst the company was helping me with that (awesome!) they'd neglected to figure out that with my visa expiring and no GC forthcoming, they should have applied for a work authorization several months ago. With the expiration of my visa **in two days**, they were going to have to put me on unpaid leave. (I had been asking for updates on this for weeks ahead of time).\n\nThankfully, the hiatus was only two months in the end, and I was back just before Christmas. I had done some 'consulting' for them which they imbursed me for afterwards along with a bonus to make up for lost earnings which was great, but let me tell you (if you've not been there), watching your bank account rapidly dwindle to zero with no idea when you're going to *be allowed to work again* is a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone.\n\nWhen I got back, I realized that a manager I had been allowed to hire (for a remote country) had been looking after my helpdesk team just fine in my absence, so I left them with him. I knew we needed to focus on infrastructure, as we'd just paid a lot of money to overhaul our network, and that needed my attention (Networking was also something I'd barely touched before this job, for various reasons).\n\nI'd intended the first half of 2024 to be focused on the new network build-out, and I had the migration of systems onto it earmarked for the spring. Ha. Men, plans, gods, laughing, etc.  \nAt the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, my mother-in-law got very, very sick and sadly passed away in early spring. (FUCK CANCER). Three weeks after our dog. (FUCK CANCER). We spent most of the first half of the year shuttling between cities and living apart, as my wife took care of her mom and I worked remotely when possible so that we could be in the same place. It was a deeply traumatic time, having to literally watch someone waste away and die in front of you (FUCK CANCER), but there was nobody else to run the network project, so on it went.\n\nWhen life returned to \"normal\" I found that, while I'd been in visa-related purgatory, HR had become very interested in our overall IT team (now comprising IT Ops (me), Business Systems, and Security). For some reason, the fact I wasn't in HQ anymore was a big issue. After COVID we had moved further away from the city. I often commuted to our satellite office (where our DC was), but there was no reason for me to be in HQ. However, there became this sort of weird witch hunt where one particular member of HR (who never tried to understand what my job actually was) seemed to be coming after me, as a way to get to my boss.\n\nAt one point, the day after my mother-in-law's memorial (along with our dog's), an engineering team piled on me because their computers had rebooted due to a delayed update. I think it was then that the fuse that I'd been dragging behind me for years, that had been lit somehow, somewhere in the not-so-distant past, caught up to me and exploded. Driving my car home, I screamed until my throat was raw. There was a moment where I very nearly just ran it straight into the concrete median. Once home, I just had a full-on breakdown. At one point, I barely knew what my name was. A few hours later, my wife and I had a deep heart-to-heart, I started going to therapy, but I didn't change my job ...\n\nWhile *those* shenanigans were going on, we discovered that our data center providers were shutting down because they were effectively going out of business. Rather than cut our losses and spend the next six months planning and executing a data center migration, my boss spent the six weeks of it trying to engineer various scenarios by which we'd stay in place. When all of that fell through, we now had considerably less time to do the planning and the executing.\n\nOnce we signed a deal with a place another few weeks in, I was also told that finance would really love it if we could cut down on the amount of racks we're using, so that it costs less.\n\nThat's how I ended up, almost single-handedly, replacing 250 servers and storage systems with \\~10% new servers (there was a lot left in that year's Capex), and planning the move. We were told that \"Engineering can give us one week\" (the week before Christmas), so everything had to go perfectly. The company's next release was **contingent** on having it back up before Christmas. Ignore the fact that the fucking release was already 18 months delayed, but sure, make it *our* fault if it's late again 🙄  \nI didn't see my wife much for a good 5-6 weeks. 8-8 days were common, 8-10 were rare but not unheard of. Seeing as we hadn't gotten to the network migration, I was doing a server replacement/upgrade **and** network migration at the same time. Two birds, one very tired stone. At one point, I looked down after a very difficult switch installation in the back of a rack (tight PDU clearance) and saw that my arm was covered in blood. I guess I'd nicked something inside the rack. Thankfully, it looked worse than it was, but it made me think about how nobody outside of IT realizes how much of our ***literal*** blood, sweat, and tears we put into this shit sometimes. Meanwhile, our lives are decided by some fucker who sits behind a desk their entire career putting imaginary numbers into boxes.\n\nThe week before Christmas was the killer. Thankfully, by that point, I had three other people with me, but the amount of work involved in a DC move is just vast. We were not allowed to shut down until 5 pm for critical systems, but ended up starting around 2 pm.  \nBy midnight, we had *most* of the racks disconnected and ready to be moved, and I was in bed by about 1 am. At 7 am the following morning, I rocked up, Panera in hand, to greet our movers. Those guys were *efficient*. Whilst we stripped the remaining racks, they got the first shipment off to our new DC five minutes down the road and, by lunch, all 20 were in their new home.  \nBy midnight, things were not looking good.\n\nI *could not* get the network up. It wasn't until the next morning that we realized a basic top-of-rack switch that was relatively new had just ... stopped forwarding traffic anywhere. We swapped it out, and we were back in business, but easily half a day behind. By 11 pm, we were zombies, so we shipped out and shipped back for 8 am the following day to continue the rebuild. For some reason, our Powerstore *would not* come back online. I spent about five hours (and several swaps of AirPods) on a call with an awesome Dell tech who helped get us back online. Sadly, because we'd just been consolidating all of our machines into vCenter, hosted from Powerstore, literally nothing was back online (because IT was on there too). We were now on Day 3 of the move, and I had confidently predicted that we'd have basic production back online by the end of Day 1, 2 at the latest. We started to bring things back online but, due to the network issues, followed by the PowerStore and the order that servers had been powered on stuff got ... weird.\n\nMultiple vCenters shit the bed differently, depending on, I guess, what had come online when. Some clusters were fine. Others needed to be rebuilt, others still needed hosts networking configurations to be reset. Super odd, but we ran down every issue and got almost everything online by Friday night. Note I said Almost.\n\nI was the only one to show up on Saturday, and I was the only one to show up on Sunday after posting in our Slack channel that things still weren't finished. I really didn't want anybody to have to work Christmas Eve, but they weren't making it easy. Thankfully by the end of the day Monday, enough was back online that we could tell everyone to go home for the holidays.\n\nThe few days off for Christmas let the burnout truly set in. I was dog tired from the last three months of 10+ hour days in a data center (thank god for noise-cancelling headphones, but it's still mild torture) and the move, the pressure of getting it right, and the pressure when things went wrong. When I went back in January, I pushed through the cleanup after the move, and was still primarily the one doing the cleaning, the tidying, the loose-end-tier-upper.\n\nAfter that I just sort of ... stopped.\n\nI still *worked,* obviously, but barely. Call it burnout, call it can't be fucked, call it whatever. By this point in my life, I've been doing this job for 20 years. \n\n20 years of every staff member is your customer, so you're going to eat shit if they tell you to. \n\n20 years of technically illiterate ELTs making technical decisions without consulting the technical people.\n\n20 years of being left in the dark on a project, then being blamed for not delivering quickly enough.\n\n20 years of being ignored and underfunded when things work, and berated and threatened when things that you said would break, break.\n\n20 years of record profits and marginal raises, and \"there's not enough in the budget for something that'll make your life better, but let's spaff 50k up the wall for a list of marketing contacts that'll get us one or two calls at best\".\n\n**Please, I encourage you to add your own! We all have them!**\n\n  \nAnyway, that brings us to this year. We had a significant leadership change at all levels and, in short order, my leadership tree was stripped away and a new CIO was installed.\n\nNow, at this point, I am a Director. My colleague, who *used* to work for me (the one I left Helpdesk with) was also now a Director, no longer reporting to me. There's a similarly convoluted story behind that but it's not mine to tell.\n\nThis poses new CIO with an organizational problem, but we decide to solve it for him. Both of us (directors) agreed that I'm good with the tech stuff and he's good with the people stuff. Let's split it that way, do what we're both best at, and deliver for this guy. That way we both get stuff we don't want off our plates and can focus on what we do want.\n\nI pitch the \"Let them cook\" plan, and CIO loves it. Says it solves his organizational problem, and opens up a sysadmin who literally built the place to go and finish making it solid.  \nI took the risk and told him straight that I had built the place up from almost nothing (and replaced whatever was there before), but that I had burned out, been diagnosed with depression, and was fighting out of it and just wanted to focus on what I knew I was good at doing.\n\nSix weeks or so later, they want to reduce my salary. On the face of it, you could say OK, sure, you're not a director anymore, you're an IC again, a cut makes sense. And I would agree with you, if it weren't for a few things ...\n\n\\- All the new hires at my (old) position came on at 30-50k more than I make, and they are being given considerable budget to hire competent, seasoned staff.  \n\\- There are comparable roles to what I'm essentially now doing online for what I'm making, if not more.  \n\\- I've already cleared a mountain of backlog and have four major projects (that he wanted) ready to go live  \n\\- This dude has not shut up about another sysadmin he used to work with.\n\nIt's the last part that sticks with me.\n\nThe money, I get. You're PE people from PE places, and numbers are all you see. You're like Neo in the fucking Matrix. Or maybe Cypher.\n\n\"I don't even *see* the people. All I see is 'Cost', 'Benefit', 'Opportunity' ...\"\n\nBut the reality is, he wants to deprive me of a job, of the means to put a roof over my head and food in my mouth, not because I'm bad at my job. Not because I've done anything wrong, but purely because he knows someone else.\n\nFuck that.\n\nI'm not even being dramatic. He brought up their name several times to the new head of HR, as well as my boss. He even had us all schedule a call together to chat and 'compare notes' so we could make everything exactly like his old company.  \nThey're great - fantastic person, probably going to be reading this and know exactly who I am. It actually made me and my boss feel pretty great because this person was \"one of us\". They shot straight, they saw the job for what it was, but they were still super psyched about technology and the opportunities we had to do cool shit with it. They were somebody who I honestly wish I had hired when I ran the place to be the new me. irony.\n\nThe interesting thing to come from the call was that a few things that CIO had beaten us over the head with because \"old company did it\" were either severe misunderstandings, or outright lies. We'd been led to believe that we were significantly behind the curve on several of our implementations and systems, when in fact we were level, or ahead, in most areas. The CIO's solution to these 'problems'? His pal could fix it. I'm sure they could, but so can I ... where it's needed. Like I said, we're ahead in a lot of places, and I fucking did that too.\n\n  \nSo here we are. 20 years in. I realized my dream of building up an IT department, and the dream, for all its many successes, which I must acknowledge, has turned into a nightmare. There is still so much in this tale that is ludicrous and excessive and I cannot tell, but what the experience of writing this has shown me is that this place is a toxic fucking mess and my psyche has been affected by the experience of it.\n\nI'm on Reddit at 1AM on a Saturday night writing this for what ... catharsis? Screaming into the void IS cathartic, and this is a digital version of that I suppose. Self-therapising? Coming to terms with *not* being wanted for no other reason than you're just not someone else. Finally realizing, as most of us do at some point, that no matter how hard and far we try to outrun it, our livelihoods are held in the hands of people who can't even be bothered to know who we are.\n\nThere's no 'realizing I gave way too much of myself for this job' because I've known that for far too long already.",

Any advice would be great. \n\nEDIT: Hi everyone, I appreciate all the comments. For context, I live in the Pittsburgh metro area. I received my first part time job in 2017 in general data entry for a natural resource management firm. I have worked in systems and web management for since 2023 at the company I was hired as an assistant and student worker. I will have my masters in ANR with an emphasis in natural resource management. As there are limited positions in my field, I am very excited to be offered a job right out of my masters program. My duties for this role include leading state-wide systems management with assistance from our IT office. I will also perform and spatial analysis/data management for each county, and lead trainings/troubleshooting for others using the system. This is an entry level position. However, it requires a masters degree and is contingent upon my graduation. The cost of living in my area is low.\n\nI am using this edit to answer the questions I have received. The position is called a systems administrator, so I thought I was posting this in the correct subreddit.  I did not anticipate this level of response lol. Thank you everyone for the insight. I understand that the job market and economy is a hot topic rn. I now know position will help me find a high paying job in the future! ",

My title is *Systems Administrator*, but I handle **everything**—servers, networking, security, backups, hardware procurement, vendor management, helpdesk, workstation imaging, compliance, onboarding, offboarding—you name it.\n\nA couple months ago, our IT manager quit abruptly and even then it was just two of us. I had just completed my performance review and raise a few weeks prior. Since then, I’ve been expected to take over all his responsibilities on top of mine with **no additional pay**, and I’m now on call 24/7 since I'm salaried.\n\nHR/leadership says I’m not eligible for another raise until my next review at the *end of the year* due to company policy. But I’m already under the weight of two jobs and keeping the entire tech stack afloat. I've had to stay overnight a few times already. I was told my job is to fix everything my boss messed up while he was here. (Server storage in red critical states, certificates wrongly created administered, etc) He had 20 years of IT experience. He left and things weren't working. First month he was gone I resolved 3 major issues he was unable to. Simply by researching how to fix and combing thru all error logs. I had nothing to go off of as he never wrote any SOPs or documentation. Not even a sheet saying where the servers and vms were located. Essentially everything the company has regarding their current environment is what I have wrote or developed how to for. (SOPs n guidance).\n\nHow can I advocate for better compensation or title change now—not 6+ months from now? Any advice from others who’ve been the lone IT person or had their role suddenly expanded to such a large degree? \n\nAppreciate any guidance.

    "text": "I've been working at my current company for about 5 years. At my previous job, I also worked as a sysadmin for around 4 years — a place where I learned everything I know today. When I got hired, I knew absolutely nothing, and my former boss handed me a brand-new laptop in its box and told me to install it and manually join it to the domain. It was a tough but incredibly rewarding time because I was the only sysadmin at a location with 70 employees.\n\nAt one point, the entire company's internet went down because my boss asked me to do cable management in the server room — I accidentally connected two ports from the same switch and created a network loop. There were also times when I had to install the BitLocker package on all company laptops (people weren’t installing the pushed package, so I had to remote in and install it myself).\n\nThe point is, I had full admin rights. I learned how to use Active Directory, Exchange Server, and laid the foundation for my knowledge in networking and server administration. It was a very stressful but beautiful period.\n\nI left that company because I needed a significant salary increase. When I joined my current company, I was shocked — all the control I was used to was gone. First of all, access to Active Directory was done through a custom tool developed by the company, and I only had access to options like changing names, email addresses, and resetting passwords. I no longer had access to Exchange Center, servers, networks — absolutely nothing.\n\nFour years have passed, and over time, the current company has cut our access to almost everything. All sysadmin-level permissions have been migrated to platforms under the idea of \"self-service.\" Any employee can now make their own changes related to their user account, mailbox, software, and so on.\n\nNow, most of what I do is laptop installations, replacing faulty peripherals, and solving minor issues because colleagues reach out to me on Teams. Over time, I’ve tried to take courses to develop myself in DevOps and Linux. But sometimes I sit and think about how, a few years ago, I was creating policies to optimize company processes, and now I’ve reached the point where I’m just replacing a broken mouse. It deeply saddens me and makes me feel like I’m losing all hope in my professional life.\n\nI want to change something, but I can't find the motivation or the path to take.",

It will be a bit long but I hope it will give encourage to a person.\n\nI have studied mechanical engineering in Turkey (as a Turkish :D) but I was always craving something about software. I was studying away from my hometown and I did not have a computer while studying, so I was borrowing computer of my housemate or going to pc labs in university and I was playing with Python but I was always feeling that I can not code or write algorithms. So idea of doing something in software was always somewhere in my brain...\n\nSo when I was in 2nd semester of 3rd year in university (bachelor degree is 4 years in Turkey) COVID happened and everybody was home. One day I was looking jobs in Poland (during that time period I went to Poland for a semester via Erasmus and I was looking a way to go Poland to live with my girlfriend-mother of my child now) through Glassdoor, oh boy.. every company was looking for DevOps engineers, half of the roles in the entire website was about DevOps. So I was wondering what is that thing.  \n\n\nI found a Youtube video about \"DevOps engineer requirements\" and it was saying \"Python and Linux are enough for a junior DevOps\" (back in time it was enough but probably not now :D). So I said to myself \"I am quite familiar with Python, so let's check that Linux thing\".  \nI had always computer at home since my birth and I was already curious about tech and for a guy like that I have heard Linux million times but I did not check what is that. \n\nSo I started check stuff about Linux, setup a Ubuntu VM in my computer blah blah and... It was miracle for me, I have enjoyed every second of it. Writing something over CLI, seeing how things are done over commands was mind blowing for me, really really really. I said that is definitely something for me.  \n  \nAnd I started dig and read everything I see related about DevOps, I started to play with Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, AWS... That was pure-pure-pure joy for me, building a CI/CD pipeline using many tools and seeing how fast things are over cloud was like a miracle to me. \n\nAll of these things were happening during COVID, my biggest advantage was everybody was at home and I have 24 hours for myself as a university student. So I spent minimum 5 hours every day for 5-6 months. I was always digging and doing something hands-on and writing Medium articles about it and sharing over LinkedIn. After sometime some people noticed me and offered me a Linux Admin role over LinkedIn, I was super happy to have the interview, and I felt very confident because I was about to talk with someone about topics I had studied every day for the past six months.  \nThat was a small company and they have offered something around minimum wage and I have rejected their offer because they were asking to work on-site even though COVID was not fully controlled, plus I was still studying university from home.\n\nSo I felt that I need a bit rest from DevOps stuff and waste sometimes for myself, but I saw my first company's DevOps bootcamp post in LinkedIn and post says they will hire the people that they liked during the camp, so I applied to camp. And they called me 1 week later and we scheduled a meeting.  \nMeeting started and I was feeling super-uber confident, after 15 minutes HR said they are looking to hire me directly, because my CV looks like I don't need their DevOps bootcamp. So they hired me :D, company was offering fully remote role.\n\nI see that post is going to grow, I will start to keep it simple.   \nMy first company was a DevOps consultancy company and they were having many customers. I have worked in that company for 1 year and 3 months. Every day was a challenge, every day a different kind of problem in different customers environment. I was waking up multiple times for alert calls, and handling deployments very early in the mornings + late in the nights. So I can really say that I have gained 5 years of experience in that 1 year and 3 months.  \nSo guess what happened? BAM! BURN OUT!  \nI started to question myself \"Did I choose wrong career path?\", \"Maybe I could stick with mechanical engineering\", \"All of my career and every day of my life will be painful\"\n\nI could not switch my job easily because I was not having work permit in Poland, due to that I could not quit my job in Turkey (by the way I earn in Turkish lira but I live in Poland. And my salary was barely enough to live). I was having many many job offers over LinkedIn but every company was saying \"we can't hire you because we have to grant work permit for you and it takes minimum 6 months, so we can't wait that long\"\n\nAt the end I have found a company that agree to grant me work permit and wait 6 months for that, because of that situation I had to keep my salary expectation really low (if you compare other mid level jobs). So I have worked for that company around 1 year and started to receive many many job offers, they were generally senior position roles. So I have choose the company which pays good and the tech stack I like.\n\nYes, after exactly 2 years and 3 months of experience I have received multiple senior job offers and landed at one of them. Now I work in Polish companies around 3 years, every day is comfortable and very quiet. Nothing left from burn out.\n\nThat was my story, please ignore grammar mistakes and enjoy your path.  \nGood things are not earned easy, give yourself sometime and keep moving on. I know job market is not doing well not but its not your fault, do always something for yourself and worry about the stuff which depends on you, not others.",

    "title": "future of Tech.",
    "text": "Hi Folks,\n\nThe title is a little bit bold but nevertheless it is what is concerning me and many others for a while. I love this community, this is where I started using Reddit so it's the place imo I should discuss this.\n\nI'm ~~founder~~ engineer and janitor of prepare sh, you probably seen it being discussed here, but today I want to talk about something else. Never in my life I thought I'd be thinking \"shall I quit tech?\", \"is it a viable career?\", \"is there a **future in Tech?**\"\n\nI see daily posts of desperation from young folks, applying for 300-400 jobs in a short matter of time to be ghosted, rejected, disrespected by companies sending AI interviewers showing how invaluable engineers are that they don't even assign a real person to conduct an interview.\n\nI believe STEM path requires certain aptitude and resilience, and those people could have easily become something else like Doctors, Mechanics, etc. and wouldn't witness (not to this degree) never ending vicious cycle of upskilling, ageism, and layoffs.\n\nI'm not saying doctors, and other professions have it easy, but there are many specialties such as dentistry etc that pay very well, are extremely stable and simply can never be outsourced. You go through some shit to get there but once you're there by say 35 or so, you're pretty much set for life. And with more experience you only become more valuable, unlike tech where you're on the hamster wheel of constant upskilling just to not fall behind. And even if you manage to stay relevant and up-to-date you'll still get shit from people once you're 40+ as ageism starts to hit you.\n\nWe've been lied to continuously by media, government, and big tech about shortage of talent in tech. They had their agenda to destroy tech salaries and boost their revenues and if you ask me they've achieved it successfully. Sure there is a shortage when someone is offering very low salary and requiring years of experience, but I've yet to witness shortage where adequate compensation is offered.\n\nSo the question is where do we go from here? Do we continue riding this increasingly unstable roller coaster, constantly fighting to stay relevant in an industry that seems designed to burn us out and replace us? Or do we start seriously considering alternatives that offer more stability and respect for experience? I'm genuinely curious what others in this community think, especially those who've been in tech for 10+ years. Are these concerns overblown, or are we witnessing the slow collapse of what was once considered the most promising career path of our generation?",

    "text": "Hey guys\n\nI am currently working as a DevOps engineer with a somewhat modern techstack  (Kubernetes, Git, Gitlab, Ansible, AWS, Python, RHEL, Podman etc.) We are responsible for a specific product (which is pretty boring TBH) and I’m there to automate the software development processes.\n\nNow I had the chance to interview for a new position which would bump me up to senior level and would come with a salary increase.\n\nAt first I was pretty convinced of the position but then I started to have doubts. Mainly because the Techstack does not include Kubernetes which I’m pretty bummed about. I would also have to get familiar with specific Microsoft products mainly in the Endpoint Security space.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it worth switching for a higher salary and to get a more senior role (where I would also have to mentor some of the junior guys and “market” our team to the business to get more visibility etc.) but would have to deal with the fact that they don’t use Kubernetes and would have to dive deeper into more proprietary tools/software?",

    "title": "How much is your pride worth?",
    "text": "Bit of an inflammatory title, but it fits my current situation.\n\nI work at a company that is almost quite literally hell-bent on killing me. I work anywhere from 14 to 16 hours a day almost every day of the week. If I try to only work 8 hours a day or not work weekends, projects go to shit because I'm not able to keep the US, UK, and India teams on the same page after a couple of weeks. It's a very disorganized company where the left hand never knows what the right is doing, teams are uncoordinated, etc. \n\nHonestly, from this perspective, it sucks. However, I lead a team of 7 people tackling a crazy amount of cool projects across the organization. I have built a ton of respect, confidence, and trust from upper management and across teams. At this company, I've touched about everything you can touch when it comes to cloud providers, version control systems, tech stacks in general, etc. To the point from when I interview, it borderline sounds like I'm lying.\n\nBut again, I'm working too much and missing too much of my family's life and my own. Now for the dilemma.\n\nI just got an offer from another company. I originally interviewed for one of their most senior devops positions but lost out to someone else. The recruiter, team, and management wanted to keep me in mind for future openings blah blah we've all heard it before. Maybe I'll hear back from them in a year, ya know? However,  I recently got a call from them that they had a backfill opportunity, and while its not what they wanted to offer me, its a position they had open and want me to join the team. All the promises of advancement and promotion opportunities, etc.. were made on the call. Essentially, it's a less senior title with less senior responsibilities. And that's my issue.\n\nSo I feel that I'm stuck in this weird place. The potential employer sounds like an awesome place to work. They have a robust and well-built devops team, modern app and tech stack, well coordinated teams, and just general good work-life balance. But I wouldn't be leading a team anymore, making the decisions, working with upper management and the team(s) on solutions, etc.. but instead delegated work and given marching orders. \n\nCareer wise and even just general work type(?) I feel like I'm taking a hit to my pride. In my head, it makes absolutely no sense to say no but I'm also jaded about employer promises (literally never seen one follow through) and trust a company about as far as I can throw it. Where I'm at now, I'm *the* guy that solves issues, makes the calls, smooths over issues, and gets projects or things in general moving to where they need to be. And that feels great, but again, it's killing me, practically literally. The bags I have under my eyes are crazy.\n\nSo, I'm asking the community here. How much is your pride worth? Comp in this offer is fine in both salary and bonus, and there's an offer of equity (not a lot but not quite a little), but it's super crazy out of this world. If anyone feels like I'm just being an obtuse ass, call me out on it. That's pretty much what I'm asking for.\n\nEdit: After typing all of this out and re-reading it. I realize I'm being an idiot. So I'm going to accept the job. I'll leave the post up rather than delete it for anyone who wants to call me an idiot. I think I just needed to just put it all out there to get my head on straight.\n\nEdit 2: I want to say thank you for the feedback, both harsh and kind. It's appreciated and good to have that sort of criticism and perspective. I had already settled on accepting the offer, but you all solidified it. So, thank you again.",
