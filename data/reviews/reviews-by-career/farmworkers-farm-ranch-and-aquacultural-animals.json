    "title": "Blowing Thorns Off Cactus Pads to Feed Cattle – Anyone Else Doing This? (Jerez, Zacatecas)",
    "text": "We’ve been using cactus (nopal) as supplemental feed for our cows here in Jerez, Zacatecas. In this video, we’re using a blowtorch to burn off the thorns from the cactus pads before feeding them. It’s extra work, but the cows eat it up—especially in the dry season when grass is scarce.\n\nCurious if anyone else out there feeds cactus to their livestock? How do you prep it? Have you seen any noticeable effects—good or bad?\n\nFor those unfamiliar:\nCactus is high in water content and provides energy mainly through carbohydrates. It’s low in protein and fiber, so we supplement with our own oat/wheat blend (about 60/40). We also keep mineral blocks out year-round. From what I’ve seen, cactus pads (Opuntia) can offer:\n\t•\t~85% water\n\t•\t~6–8% carbohydrates\n\t•\t~1–2% crude protein\n\t•\tHigh in calcium, low in phosphorus\n\nWould love to hear how others are using cactus, especially in dryland or desert ranching areas.",

    "title": "Inheriting ranch, what do I do first to live there?! Wild, untouched land.",
    "text": "\n\nI have found myself in a great, but unique situation. \n\ntldr: I’m inheriting my family ranch in Texas after living in a major city for 20 years. Want to move there with husband and kids. Bad credit, no savings but Grandparents still live there and will help us out some. What do I do?\n\nWe are done with city life. I grew up country there so none of the bugs/animals/outdoorsy aspects bother me. My Grandparents had offered this prospect of moving out there for years, but it was always a kinda pie in the sky idea for us because my husband is a city boy and will have to commute to work. He came around to the idea because I really want this and we are drowning financially after renting for 20+ years. \n\nI don’t feel like we are financially ready to even be able to qualify for a construction loan and we aren’t exactly “handymen” so I don’t see us pulling off a diy log cabin. \n\nWe have been offered their decent rv but we can also of course stay in their house. That’s a very short term option though - we don’t need to be together 24/7. 😵‍💫\n\n* Does it make sense to buy a trailer to live in during construction? Are trailers/mobile homes ever movable and for rent? \n\nThe house can be built anywhere and the best options are:\n\n1. A beautiful completely open clearing, fenced off due to the cattle that used to be there, no trees. Beautiful view of the woods on most sides. I’m just concerned about no tree shade, though I’m going to make damn sure we get the best hvac system we can practically afford no matter what. \n\n2. The open field next to their house but would be sandwiched with their neighbor. They’re nice neighbors and I don’t think they would like it feeling crowded all of a sudden. This would be the most cost effective way though because we wouldn’t have to build a road to the back end of the property and it would be easier to hook up water and electricity etc. \n\n3. Move to the edge of the woods so there’s some shade but not under a complete canopy. This is completely wild land, never been lived on. I worry about the tree roots fucking up the foundation over time. \n\n4. I can’t help but kinda love the idea of building in the straight up deep woods but that would probably be a nightmare due to bugs and animals, wouldn’t it? I think I’m accidentally imagining the 7 dwarves house in Snow White. \n\nI know my thoughts are scattered here. I’m overwhelmed at this dream coming true because we weren’t financially prepared to be priced out of the city so soon. I’ve been a stay at home mom for 11 years and we have a 1 year old so I won’t be finding a job until he’s in school. \n\nIf I left info out, please ask. I’d love any and all advice about any part of this. Crossposting it to get different perspectives about the different questions. Thanks! ",

    "text": "We have a part time hand that works a few days during the week while going to college. He is all around a great young man. Wonderful manners and personality with a great work ethic that you can’t find often nowadays. He is always very careful and cautious operating equipment but we have had more issues come up with his lack of fear in situations where he is excited. He is interested in snakes and has a knack for catching them but there have been times he couldn’t identify if it was venomous or not and would ask us after he had caught the snake and brought it over to us. Twice now they have been venomous. I have insisted on a no messing with any snakes while on work time rule now. The same issue has happened with cattle on occasion. Where he clearly is not reading their body language and I have had to tell him to stop approaching a mother protecting a dead or live calf that was ready to fight someone but it took 3 times of “stop walking towards her” to get him to stop. In these moments he is so excited like he is on cloud 9 but it’s like his eyes glaze over and he has no sense. As soon as the moment is over he is the perfect sensible worker again. He is young only 19 so I don’t know if this will lessen with age. He is a great employee and I’d hate to have to let him go over this but also don’t wanna be the person calling his parents saying he won’t be coming home. Has anyone had experience with getting an employee to learn to stop breath and think for a minute in these situations to develop impulse control even when excited? Or is this a personal nature that won’t change?",

    "text": "So, we have a ranch in Eastern Colorado, and there are a lot of wind turbines around. It's my Grandmother's ranch, and we don't run cattle anymore, we lease the land to some other ranchers that still do. \n\nRecently a wind energy company has reached out about putting turbines in some of our pastures. I'm not worried about how much they'll pay, but I am interested in what other ranchers have experienced.  \n\nDoes it affect the cattle? Does it make things more difficult for ranching? What about land value, does it decrease the value of the land for ranching? Does anyone have any experience with these projects? \n\n\nUPDATE: we've heard more from the company, this is still quite far in the future, and since my grandmother is 97, and when she dies my mom, aunt &amp; uncle split the land, if she expresses interest it will have to be their decision. Thank you all for the insight, you gave me a lot to research. Since I'm the family nerd, I'll have to gather all of the articles and advice to pass it on for them to consider. ",

    "text": "I started helping at 2 ranches as a part time gig for extra fun money , job wasn’t needed to pay the bills etc etc \n\nFirst place I worked at was a small operation, I just went on weekends to do cleanup and handyman type jobs for an elderly lady, honestly an awesome place and awesome lady , but she had to “let me go” bc she said she ran out of money and couldn’t pay me anymore \n\nStarted working at this 2nd place, pays me consistently and closer to home. But this lady is an absolute nightmare, I do the same cleanup job. Get there after my day job, clean stalls and pens, food chores etc. but this lady will find ANYTHING to be upset about, it’s a 40 acre property and everyday she will drive around looking for anything I missed , she’ll find 1 freshly laid pie and send me a video 3 hours after Iv been home saying I’m irresponsible and not doing the job correctly. After a short rainy week I was cleaning off and hosing off one of their wheel barrels , she passed by me with her granddaughter and asked what I was doing and I said “just cleaning this off clean so it doesn’t cake up more and I can pull it through the muck” and she called me stupid and crazy and told me to knock it off. All infront of her granddaughter and the rest of her family ( this was while I worked on Christmas Eve and Christmas). \n\nShe lied to me and said the alfalfa cubes got wet from the rain bc I didn’t put a cover over it (the cubes were dryer than a rusted bucket in Nevada) \n\nThen she started a rumor about me that she fired me , I only heard word bc my friend that also works there told me about it . I asked if I should confront her and he said it wouldn’t change anything it’s just how she is \n\nShe’s always talking shit about employees to other employees, and then acts like a saintly Christian online when people give the ranch bad reviews , and she’s constantly getting sued \n\nMy question is : am I being a pussy about wanting to quit this job? \n\nEdit : alright alright cowboys I hear ya 😂, when my wife gets back from her trip and goes back to her job I’ll get my last check and leave this place In my rear view mirror.

A quick bio, I was raised on a cattle and hog farm, joined the USMC, got out in 2018 and got an office gig (contracting and now government work). After working in an office for over a decade, I've realized I'm only happy at home with my family and miserable in my office box at work. I miss the farm life but can't go back to it (parents separated/step parent owned the farm). So now, I'm in my 30's and dare to even think about leaving my stable career for a fantasy, uprooting my family (that I only see in the evenings) for the possibility of owning and managing a ranch with a decent elk herd. I understand the hurdle of upfront investment costs but I love the animal and miss the farm lifestyle. I also want to leave something for my kids after I'm gone other than money. \n\nJust looking for some advice. Should I stick with my cushy federal job with all the benefits and retire in my 60's or should I chase after an unknown (potentially happy or disastrous) fantasy of starting an elk ranch in the Eastern side of the U.S.?",
