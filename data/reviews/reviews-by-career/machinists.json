    "title": "Rubik's Cube- Manually machined from aluminum, fully functional",
    "text": "Hi everyone, thought I'd share a passion project of mine that I did over this summer. I'm a college student who learned the basics of machining for my manufacturing class, and I thought I'd use my college's makers' space to make something really memorable.\n\nDisclaimer: I didn't create the original design myself- the idea and drawings were adapted from this website: [https://lulabs.net/machining/ss-cube/](https://lulabs.net/machining/ss-cube/)\n\nHowever, I did need to do a substantial amount of adjustment to the original plan to suit my needs. I ended up making it out of aluminum, mostly because, as the website points out, a steel cube is way to heavy to be easily solvable.\n\nMaterials used:\n\n\\-4' of 1\"x1\" square 6061 stock\n\n\\-1' of 3/8\" rod 6061 stock\n\n\\-6 4/40 screws\n\n\\-6 small compression springs, max load of 1-2 pounds\n\nLet's go through the basic process. First up are the \"plans\" I used throughout- they ended up looking pretty insane. The best part of solo projects is that your plans only have to make sense to you. The cube consists of:\n\n\\- a six-sided core with tapped holes.\n\n\\- six stems with one small through hole and one larger blind hole as well as external threads. This stem traps a spring-loaded screw, which presses the whole cube together while allowing it to rotate freely.\n\n\\-six face centers, with curved inside faces and a blind, tapped hole for the stems.\n\n\\-eight corner pieces\n\n\\-twelve edge pieces. The edge and corner pieces have straight cuts as well as circular cuts, which was probably the biggest problem I had to solve.\n\nFirst up, cutting parts to size and squaring them up. This was easily the most tedious part of the whole project- the whole thing is really cool and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the skills, tools, and time, but there's no getting around the fact that squaring up 27 parts really sucks.\n\nNext, the stems. These were unexpectedly difficult- it's really hard to precisely machine a part that's only half an inch long in a lathe designed for parts that are multiple feet long. I also had trouble getting the threads straight, which is part of why I had to redo some of the stems.\n\nThe 7th pictures is of the face centers, after they've been given the circular cut to make the internal curved surface. I ended up using a boring bar for all the circular cuts- it was a little scary running a cutting tool at a 1.5\" diameter and 1750 rpm, but all went well.\n\nThe next two pictures are drilling and tapping holes in order to put together the stem-face center assembly. Again, getting straight threads was a challenge, and probably was the biggest contributor to wonkiness in the final product. Notice the hole on the exposed side of the stems- that's where the end of the 4-40 screw will go through.\n\nThe 10th pictures is of the core- dialing in such a tiny part on a large 4-jaw chuck was extremely frustrating, but it ended up working shockingly well.\n\nNext up, the corners and edges. First, they get rectangular cuts with an endmill. This was where the most material was taken off. To finish them off, the circular cuts with the boring bar. The corners get 3 circular cuts each, and the edges get 4 each.\n\nIn the 13th picture, you can start to see how the cube works mechanically- each edge and corner piece is designed to be able to slide freely past the others while being pressed against them. The face center is able to rotate freely, and the edges and corners are brought along for the ride.\n\nAfter all the parts were \"done\", there was a lengthy amount of finishing. Picture 14 shows the middle of the process, after I had used a file to chamfer the internal edges and remove sharp corners that interfered with turning. At this point, the cube had been fully assembled many times but this was the first time it actually behaved like a rubik's cube.\n\nNext, every external edge needed a chamfer, both to prevent people from cutting themselves, and to make it look more like a professional rubik's cube. I did that with some V blocks and an endmill.\n\nI went back and forth on the final look of the cube- I wanted the fact that it was made out of metal to be front and center, so painting it to look like the real thing was out of the question. Some people suggested anodizing it, but you can't really anodize just one face of a part. So I decided to engrave shapes in each face, and paint those shapes. That way, the cube has familiar colors while also preserving the bare metal look (and being solvable while blindfolded!)\n\nThe trouble with this, though, is that the engraving process I used was very susceptible to mistakes. I just used a ball-tipped endmill and cut about 7 thou deep. This looked great when it was done perfectly, but if any part of the setup wasn't flat, then the engraving in question was too shallow and narrow in some places, and too deep and wide in others. A few of them turned out that way... unfortunate, but not really fixable without making a new part.\n\nThen, finishing. I used a scotch-brite buffing wheel, which was much faster than sandpaper, and allowed me to easily align all the surface finish grains in one direction for extra style. I had to be choosy about which nicks and pits to try to buff out, because the engravings were so shallow that I risked making them look weird by taking off too much material. The freshly buffed cube (assembled and disassembled) are shown in pictures 16 and 17.\n\nLastly, painting. I used acrylic, which actually worked really well- when I got the water-paint ratio right, the surface tension of the water allowed the paint to fill up the slot easily without running over or sloshing around. To protect the paint, I also sprayed the whole thing with a clear coat.\n\nAnd that's it! The finished cube is shown in more detail in the last two pictures. You may be wondering, how well does it work? The answer is, about the same as an official rubik's brand. So totally serviceable, but by no means viable for a speedcuber.\n\nIt took a lot of work (at least 50 hours, probably more than 100), but I had a blast doing it. I know a lot more about machining now than I did a few months ago, and it was a much better use of my summer free time than playing video games and reading books.\n\nEdit: Here's a link to a video of me solving the cube, so you can get a sense of how well it turns.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/1nsct6a/by\\_popular\\_demand\\_heres\\_a\\_video\\_of\\_me\\_solving\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/1nsct6a/by_popular_demand_heres_a_video_of_me_solving_the/)",

    "text": "Alright machinist hive mind, riddle me this: how many of you are still knee-deep in inches, and how many of you have entered the enlightened world of millimetres?\n\nI’m genuinely curious — especially you lot over in the States. Do you actually choose to work in inches, or is it just whatever lands on your bench that day? Like, do you wake up and think, “Ah yes, today feels like a 1/64 kind of day”?\n\nHere in the UK, we officially use millimetres, but let’s not kid ourselves — it’s a Frankenstein’s monster of metric and imperial. Threads in inches, measurements in mm, tools from who-knows-where. It’s like a bad rom-com where neither system really commits.\n\nFrom what I gather, the EU is strictly millimetres (good for them), and I’m assuming Japan doesn’t entertain our imperial nonsense at all.\n\nSo what’s it like in your corner of the world? Do you stick to one system? Bounce between both and hope for the best? Ever completely borked a job because someone forgot to convert, or missed it totally? \n\nGenuinely curious what it’s like in your shops. ",

Is that normal?\n\nFor example here we do all programming/setups i have ran mostlly a 5axis mill but also program a fanuc lathe, and I have learned Fusion 360 / Gibbscam / Mastercam. Also using both Fanuc and Heidenhain. \n\nHow does life look over there?. What kinda salary do button pushers or someone closer to what i do make. \n\nThanks \n",

I’m considering applying. \nMy trouble is how soon is too soon to jump ship?  I’ve been at my current job for about 6 months and the one previous to that for about 18 months.

    "text": "I am leaving my position as a Prototype Machinist / Model Maker in a Research and Development Lab for a Pipe Fittings Company so I figured that I would send this out to see if any one felt it might fit them.\n\n[Prototype / Precision Machinist Position](https://jobs.jobvite.com/victaulic/job/o4ulwfw9) Location would be in Easton, PA.\n\n**Background:** I have been with Victaulic for 6 years and I am transitioning from a Machining position to a Facilities Excellence Management Coordinator position, so I am not leaving due to negativity. I am being given an internal opportunity to do something different in the company.\n\n**Pay:** Associate Level starts in the upper **$60,000s**, full \"Model Makers\" are in the mid to upper **70,000s**. I am leaving the position at $84k a year. I started 6 years ago as a full \"Model Maker\" making $64k.\n\nOvertime exists but it isn't consistent. \n\n**Benefits:** 5% 401K Match, 3% 401K Profit Sharing. Top notch Health Insurance (I pay around $105 a paycheck for a $350 deductible Cadillac Health Plan that covers my $6,000 a month Arthritis Meds 100%), a generous PTO Package (15 days to start, normal holidays off) plus the option to purchase 5 additional days of Optional Time Off over the course of the year. You are also allotted 5 Sick Days per year. PTO can be taken whenever you like. I have had days where I got to the parking lot, texted my boss and took a PTO day. It is written company policy that PTO is your time and you can take it whenever you like.\n\nTuition Reimbursement and Relocation Reimbursement are available as well.\n\nYearly Bonuses have been in effect for the 6 years I have been here, even during COVID. They are issued company wide for either a hard cash amount or 3% of your salary, whichever is higher. Yearly Cost of Living Adjustments have been close to the rate of inflation or just beating it.\n\n**Work Hours:** Shifts are either 7-3:30 for first shift or 2:30P-12A 4 10s for Second. Management is flexible with work times as long as you are producing good quality parts. They have no problem if you decide to work 6:30-3, for example. If you have a Drs Appointment, you can leave early and make up the time later in the week, or take PTO if it is more than 4 hours. Your workday includes 2 15 minute breaks and a 45 minute lunch. We have 2 Onsite Cafeterias that offer reasonably priced chow options.\n\n**Work Environment:** We have Prototrak Lathes, Prototrak Bed Mills, Prototrak K3 Knee Mills, 2 Haas VMCs and a Mazak VMC. This position is very much designed for the \"Jack of All Trades\" kind of worker. You would be expected to be able to learn the Prototrak conversational control and Mastercam for the other machines. Despite having a Mazak, we do no Mazatrol because we are a Mastercam Shop.\n\nThis is a pretty laid back environment where we are trusted to get our work done. I have always likened it to being an \"Independent Contractor\" in the shop. Jobs are doled out by our Tech Lead and we are expected to be able to get the work done independently. The other workers I work with are all pretty chill and are more than willing to help out with a problem or to bounce ideas off of. \n\n**There are no \"Crabs in a Bucket\" in this shop.**\n\n**Expectations:** We are looking for someone that has serious problem solving skills. You would be working directly with our engineering team to develop new products and prototypes as well as the fixturing and workholding the make what they need. A portion of our work is modifying castings before they can be tested, so having a good spatial understanding of non-flat parts is a big plus. \n\nMasterCam experience is a big plus, we are currently running 2024 and we update every 2 years once a stable version is released. Trainings are available, both in person and online with the end goal of becoming a MasterCam Certified Programmer.\n\nWe have a nascent 5S and Lean Manufacturing system in place, so that means the shop is fairly well organized with most tool boxes being Kaizened and all of our machines are kept clean and in well working order. The expectation is that the system will be expanded to include Total Productive Maintenance in the coming years.\n\nWhat we are NOT looking for: Bad Attitudes. We want people that work well with others, both in the Machine Shop day to day as well as Engineering, Design and Management.\n\nNo shop is perfect, but this is one of the better companies I have worked for in the 15+ years I have been slinging chips. The benefits are top notch, the work environment is pretty good and the crew in the machine shop is one of the best I have ever worked with in my entire career.",

    "text": "Hey guys, just wanted to get some opinions on my current situation, and whether i'm overblowing the issue.\n\nI'm a machinist just coming into my second year. I work with flat bed CNCs. When I was employed, it was as a general hand at my factory, but after a couple of months of working the floor, management realised I had a knack for machining and started training me up on the CNC, and since then they never took me off it.\n\nOver the last few months, the expectations of quality output have improved, and i've been expected to manage a second flatbed along with my first, this one being more complex with additional training required, such as operating and maintaining an oscilating knife tool, and trying not to snap the blades (having some difficulties with this part).\n\nI'm enjoying my work, but I feel as though both my workload and expectations are far exceeding my pay, which is still a general hand's salary. Is it worth bothering management to try and bump me up to the industry standard that's $6 an hour above my current wage? Or should I be happy with what i'm given as a new machinist with only a year of experience.",

    "title": "UK Machinists, how much should I be making?",
    "text": "Hey! I'm working at a shop which is pretty infamous for under paying people and often only give payrises to people who threaten to leave, so I'm just trying to work out how much I should be paid for my skills and my knowledge. \n\nThis will be a long post but I would really appreciate some feedback or some insight. If you are a machinist in the uk or if you run a machine shop, I would love some feedback. \n\nI've just finished getting my level 4 HNC in manufacturing engineering. out of 16 assignments I got 15 distinctions and 1 pass, distinctions being the highest grade possible. \n\nI have nearly 2 years of experience programming and running 3 axis mills. I can program in Tebis CAM and solidworks CAM, im also learning fusion in my free time. I'm most compitent when programming manually in heidenhain however. \n\nI've written macro programs in both fanuc and heidenhain. \n\nIn my working day I usually run 2 machines at once. I program and run one machine first and then set up the second machine while the first is running. I have experience machining plastics, aluminium, mild steels, 303 stainless and D2 tool steel and I regularly  work in tolerances down to 0.025mm \n\nI have experience in machining large parts up to 1000mm * 500mm and as small as 10mm * 10mm. \n\nDue to a lot of people leaving I'm one of 3 fully trained full time machinists. I'm therefore responsible for ensuring my machines are maintained weekly, filters are cleaned, coolant concentration and pH is correct, oil is topped up and that the machine is safe to use. \n\nI would like to say that I kick out parts at a reasonable rate. I work in a place where everything needs to be done yesterday and I usually never get complaints about my speed. \n\nOn top of that I have some specialised knowledge on other machines, I was fully trained on a gundrilling machine by sombody who left, so after I've spent nearly a year using it full time I have the most knowledge in the shop on how to use the machine. \n\nIn the last year I've also been training apprentices which has definitely improved my leadership skills and my ability to manage other people. \n\nLastly, I work in shifts and I regularly do overtime when asked. I work upwards of 50 hours a week sometimes and when at work I like to think I'm working as quickly and as efficiently as I can. For example I take my lunch only when both machines are running and I program parts or write macro programs in my free time instead of sitting on my phone. \n\nI'm pretty young in comparison to everybody else at the shop which is why I think im being underpaid. People in management who don't see me work often assume I'm incompetent or slow in comparison to other people, which makes me really sad because I've worked extremely hard to try and prove myself only for them to make sweeping assumptions. \n\nI'm currently making less than £14 an hour or 28k a year without overtime. Is this standard for this field of work? Can I expect much more concidering my experience and my age? \n\nIn the past I've been given payrises because of my performance however my skills have significantly increased in the past year and I've had nothing. When I ask for a payrise I just want to know what I should expect.  \n\nRemember, I'm in the UK, so our ecomony is very different when compared to the US or Canada. Some of you guys in America are making $100k a year but over here that's pretty rare. \n\nThe average UK salary is £37k a year for full time employees.\n\n",
