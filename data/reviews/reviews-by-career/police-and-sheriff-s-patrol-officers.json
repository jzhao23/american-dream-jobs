    "text": "Our very own Senior Constable Jade from the Gold Coast now holds the Guinness World Record for most pull ups in one hour, completing 733 💪\n\nJade spent eight months training for the 24 hour record and raising money for Blue Hope, (smashing 3,500 pull ups in a 12 hour training session), but tore her bicep a week before her attempt. \n\nAfter five weeks off from doing any pull ups, she decided to tackle the one hour record. Congratulations, Jade! 💙",
