Because the type of carpentry I do is pretty far outside of general carpentry they don't have any established habits that conflict with my trade. They've been mostly stripping paint and assisting me when I have to be on site until today. \n\nOn the current project I was hoping to preserve and restore some of the carved elements on a portico. After they stripped the paint off a few of them I was able to assess the overall condition and came to the realization that these are too far gone to reuse. This means that I have to replicate 40 of these pieces. \n\nSo today I made a couple of templates and showed my helper how to mark and carve. We were able to discuss the approach together (I am not a woodcarver!), troubleshoot some potential problems, and determine that all we needed to use are pareing chisels, no gouges or carving knives necessary. \n\nThe first one I tried doing myself while they were cleaning up the paint removal area. I made enough mistakes to call it a wash, and to let them know how I did it wrong. \n\nI showed them how to use the template to determine the convex curve, handed them the pareing chisel, and said \"Have at it!\". \n\nIt took them about an hour to do one, with the occasional questions and bit of guidance, and it came out great! Not perfect, there are a few mistakes in the first one, but definitely good enough to install up high. \n\nIf they can get the time down to a half an hour each and stay relatively within the parameters I will call that a job well done. \n\n",

    "text": "I thought the building envelope flair would be most appropriate since the tree penetrated the building envelope in two places!\n\nAnyways I'm just a decent DIY homeowner that bought a house with a tree growing through it. I know it was a carpenter from 1988 that did it; since I found date-stamped plywood underneath the gravel bed, and a smoked Marlboro Gold and spent match underneath that ply, ha! I've only seen super-skilled carpenters smoke Golds ...\n\nAnyways, I love following this sub in order to see the cool stuff you pros do; so I thought I'd just share this sort of outlandish thing now that I've completed the demo work and am gradually restoring the area. I know this isn't the sub for homeowner posts but I hope this is interesting enough for an exception!\n\nOriginally this was a tree penetrating a spruce sun deck that was then enclosed as a solarium (photo 5), with the tree remaining there. The existing deck knee wall was just used as the base for the solarium; and then Four Seasons replaced the whole original solarium in 2019. I tried to highlight the build details as well as the damage this whole thing caused over time in the captions to the photos, but happy to answer any questions if anyone has them. The damage was really two fold - 1) From the tree directly: water flowing down the tree penetrated the floor joists and subfloor and caused rot; and the tree growth and sway was really shaking things loose; 2) The 2019 solarium install was not the best, and has led to a lot of rot in the corners as water flows down the rafters and pools/drips in the corners.\n\nI suppose I would have kept it, but once I pulled off the decking underneath the house, I could see I only had about 3\" of space before the tree would hit my main beam given all the box joinery and such; so only about 5 years of tree growth before it would have to come out anyways.\n\nI'm almost to the stage where I can pull the ledgerboard back into the house and then start clamping and bringing the joists back in and putting hangers on them (lots of gradual floor jack twisting and stud levelling with wedges). Since the 'drift' of the ledgerboard has opened up some of the wall seams, I'd rather try to get everything back plumb and level vs just trying to secure it all in place. I put all that under-structure bracing in before the tree guys came in to remove it; since given the structural issues, I didn't want an errant sway of a multi-ton tree to send a chainsaw wielding arborist through my floor ... but it's also been super useful as I level and raise everything back to where it should be though!\n\nOf course, as a new homeowner, I'm kind of pissed to see all the hot-mud and poor paint patches the previous homeowner slapped in there to hide everything before I bought it ... I could see there were issues when I did my inspection (not that the inspector caught them), but didn't think it was this bad. Of course, you never know with water damage until you start demoing ...",

    "text": "Little bit of a vent here. I’m a 3rd year carpenter with 1.5 years of framing and 1.5 years of formwork. 2 months ago I applied to a custom structure installer (sheds, cabanas, gazebos etc.) with hopes of starting a career here. They were looking for a 3rd set of hands, they were having a hard time knocking out builds in a timely manner with only 2 guys. The owner was having to go on site to help.\n\nThey took me on, listened to all my needs in the interview (living wage, consistent work, room for growth) and ensured they’d be met. Told them I had a kid and that I was hoping to find somewhere long term to grow to continue to provide for him &amp; my family. They interviewed a couple other guys and chose me out of the bunch fully knowing my experience level.\n\nI show up every day, 10 minutes early and help the other installer clean out the truck from the day before and load it up. I always haul as much as I can possibly handle and push my limits to exceed expectations.\n\nI’m 2 months in and we’re already at a point where we’re capable of doing installs without the install supervisor (just 2 guys), something they were struggling to do in the first place. The 2 guys I work with (install super, other installer) regularly compliment my work/work ethic and give me pointers on how to improve and what the customer wants to see.\n\nWe had a good week, we’re ahead of schedule and we’re booked all the way into November. Friday (yesterday), they unexpectedly put me on a delivery with one of the guys at the shop while the other installer &amp; install supervisor finish off Fridays project. A little unusual but nothing indicating what’s to come. \n\nFriday, 4:00pm, 3 hours after I’ve gotten home I receive a call from the owner: “it’s not going to work out. You should’ve been more up front with me about your experience level. 28$/hour is too much money. I was hoping to find someone with more experience.” My resume was right in front of you during the interview…\n\nI asked if there was anything I could do, even take a pay cut because I absolutely love this job and everyone I work with has been amazing to me. He said no. He’d try and find me a spot in the shop but most likely no.\n\nWhat the hell? I’m with you for 2 months, you regularly tell me “good job today!” and never has he said anything that would’ve led me to believe I was under qualified or ‘not cut out’. They hired me to be a 3rd set of hands, that’s exactly what I made sure I was. What experience do you expect out of a 3rd year apprentice who’s 23 years old? The other installer is going on paternity leave in about a month. This just makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\n\nAnyone have any advice? Does this seem right to you? Or did I just get unfortunately f-cked? There’s no detail I’m leaving out, I’ve never made any catastrophic mistakes or incompetent decisions. I cannot figure out for the life of me why this would happen and why suddenly 2 months later I’m not experienced enough when everything was fine leading up to this point.\n",

    "text": "As I've been getting older and my priorities shift more towards being able to own a home and provide for a family, I'm often second guessing whether pursuing a career in carpentry was really a good idea or if I'm wasting my potential.\n\nI still don't know the answer to that, it's easy for me to be jealous of friends who seem to have found a cushy office job with a high salary with the option to WFH with nothing but a Bachelor's they've already paid off. At the same time, I know comparison is the thief of joy, and the grass isn't always greener.\n\nOne thing which I do love about this work is how often I am outside and getting exercise, even during the winter. Our species didn't evolve to be sitting at a desk staring at a computer screen. Exposure to sunlight, fresh air, and steady physical activity satisfies biological needs that are difficult to meet unless your profession involves getting those things.\n\nAdditionally, the shortage of people in the trades and getting into the trades in general really sets you apart as a young millenial / gen Z. I'm among the handful of people I personally know that can actually work on a house and fix things, or is just generally handy. The unique skillset makes you quite valuable as a guy to know.\n\nI've been lifting weights for years, was a wrestler for over 10, but I still think this line of work has hardened me in ways nothing else has. My pain tolerance is quite high; I hardly notice minor cuts and scrapes, I can endure hours of discomfort no problem, I essentially have no fear of heights anymore... roller coasters aren't exciting anymore but it's still pretty cool.\n\nI'm hoping the market changes and wages for carpenters increase relative to other careers. But even if it doesn't, it still provides an honest living and it's not too bad all things considered.\n\nWhat are some things you enjoy about the work?",

    "text": "I know this has likely been asked before but it's been on my mind a lot lately as the year comes to a close.\n\nA little background, used to work in various administrative positions, about seven years back I was deeply unhappy and quit. I took big a pay cut to work with some friends doing home remodeling, I was basically the gofer, sweeping floors etc.\n\nA few years ago said friends and myself left the company we were working for to go out on our own. At first I loved the flexibility/freedom and didn't care what we made money wise. But now going into our fourth year I'm finding myself at a critical juncture and trying to decide where to go from here.\n\nMy two partners at the company have very low financial needs and don't want to work a lot. For the past few years we've worked on average 30 hour weeks and made about $25-35k each per year (in a medium to low cost of living Midwestern city). I find myself constantly needing to supplement our schedule with additional work to make ends meet. Juggling my own \"side job\" schedule and the commitments of the company is incredibly stressful and I still struggle immensely financially.\n \nMy partners insist that to make roughly $60k a year (the minimum salary I've stated I desire) we would have to work 60-70 hour weeks year around with no time off and try to subcontract extensively. But I'm just not entirely sure I believe this to be true. I think that we work too many short days, and don't quote high enough. Part of me is convinced that on my own, and with advertising (something we currently don't do and only really work off word of mouth) I could stay booked year around and easily make $60k a year doing paint and drywall alone. I have no interest in being a general contractor or taking a \"manager\" role as that just sounds joyless and counterintuitive to everything I love about this career.\n\nSo basically I'm asking is it possible to work a reasonable schedule and make a decent living or is that a pipe dream? Should I give up my flexible lifestyle and go back to doing this work for someone else to have a more solid and reliable income? \n\nSincerely,\n\nA Stressed Out Carpenter",

    "text": "I’m hoping to get some advice on how to explore this career path. For some background, I’m 27F and I want to leave the corporate world and am thinking about getting into the trades. I can’t live my life behind a desk for 12 hours everyday (coming from private banking). Well - it’s more the lack of doing anything physical than the hours. I want to work with my hands, I’m creative, I want to make things. When I reflected on what I want to do - I want to do physical work and I want to build things. I’m very interesting in carpentry and am not quite sure how to go about getting my foot in the door. I know carpentry encompasses many different areas so I don’t want to minimize that - I just don’t know what in carpentry I’d be most interested in yet. My family/extended family are for the most part white collar workers and so I’ve never been exposed to this type of work. I want to have a realistic view on what working in this field looks like and see if it works for me. I am posting here so I can gain some advice. I’ll list out some of my biggest questions below.\n\nIs the best place to start contacting my local union? UBC? How should I network?\n\nI’ve heard starting out as an apprentice and learning on the job (and getting paid) is the best way to go - but how exactly do you go about that? \n\nWhat do wages looking like at an entry level and how do they grow? I live in the tri-state area - though I might be interested in traveling up to the Adirondacks and finding work up there. I really love Adirondack homes and woodwork. (I’d honestly be interested in working on building homes in the ADKs - are there jobs that work on the whole process like general construction or is it mostly specialized to each part of the home building process?)\n\nIs there a pipeline for carpentry work - like you begin doing some type of work and progress to other fields as you learn more? For example, learning to frame homes and then eventually getting into say interior work? Or can you start with something like millwork?\n\nAre tools provided or do you need to invest in your own? Or does it depend?\n\nWhat advice would you give yourself if you were starting all over?\n\nI appreciate any advice you have to offer. Sorry if any of this is redundant in this thread or even naive to ask - I just need to start somewhere.",

I really enjoy going to work, and I've recently started taking my own side jobs on the weekend as well. Despite things going relatively smooth over the last couple years in carpentry, I'm starting to see some of the downsides of my industry in the long run and I'd like to hear your feedback on whether an alternative trade such as HVAC is a suitable option for myself going forward.\n\nI'm recently married and now in my mid twenties. My wife and I are thinking about kids in the near future. I'm worried because carpenters as employees, on the tools, don't get paid enough to support a family these days. After speaking with many of my coworkers and others in carpentry, it seems the only way to make a family supporting income is to get into project management or to start your own business- but PM's and contractors seem to hate their lives a lot of the time because of how much work consumes their lives throughout the week and often over entire weekends as well.  \n  \nI've had a lot of requests for side work as of late, but my entire weekend gets taken up (planning, building, bookkeeping, etc), which is a blessing, but my life is consumed by work 7 days a week which isn't amazing.\n\nBasically- all I hope for my future is an adequate income but also enough time to be around for my future kids. It seems like a lot to ask for these days.... In your opinion, would switching to HVAC or a higher paying trade be a good idea for someone like myself?\n\nThank you!",

    "text": "Hello Reddit group, my son just recently graduated from a construction program and has found employment as a carpenters apprentice. I would like to buy him a graduation present that is sentimental and he can keep for his lifetime. I am wondering if anybody in this group had some suggestions for me.  I’m not looking at the most expensive.  I’m looking for a gift that will last him a lifetime and bring fond memories.\n\nEDIT:    Thank you everyone for the great suggestions.    I have decided to get him the gas station burrito with the Monster energy drink.    Also, a custom tape measure with his name engraved inside a full-grain leather pouch.  If he doesn’t like the tape measure, it can sit on a shelf in his home as a commemorative for his graduation with a diploma in building and construction.     Thanks gain for the suggestions, as you can see it was very helpful\n",
