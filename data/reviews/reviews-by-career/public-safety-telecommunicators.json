    "text": "I took a call from an absolutely frantic mother this morning after she and her husband woke up smelling smoke and found out their daughter had successfully completed suicide in their garage. I won’t say how because I don’t want to put that kind of thing out into the universe, but I’m sure you can come to the correct conclusion. I couldn’t get much out of her besides screaming, you know that wounded animal, broken soul kind of primal scream? Like that. The kind that you’re gonna hear replayed in your head on a loop for the next little while. \n\nI’m fine, besides listening to this woman scream on repeat in my head but I do feel awful for that family knowing that that trauma is something they have to now carry forever. I’m not a new dispatcher, this is my seventeenth year so this is not my first suicide or my first screaming caller, although it was my first suicide in this manner. I started dispatching at 19  and am now 36, so I’ve heard a thing or two. I don’t really know what the point of this was except to vent to some people who “get it”.\n\nThanks for reading, friends. Take care of yourselves. \n\n",

I carefully turned her onto her side, checked her vitals, etc. Meanwhile, my girlfriend was laughing hysterically, tears streaming down her face. I asked her to go get her mom. I could see her, barely able to walk from how much she was laughing. We were 17 at the time.\n\nTwelve years later, I was a dispatch for 911. I was supervising a call with a new dispatcher, and the person on the line was barely able to speak, laughing uncontrollably. The dispatcher was about to hang up, thinking it was a prank call. The caller kept repeating, \"Please send... (laughter) help, send help... (laughter).\" It's hard to describe, but it sounded like the caller was mocking us. She looked at me and asked, \"Can I disconnect?\"\n\nI remembered that scenario from over a decade ago. I shook my head no and told her to get the address. If it is a prank, I'd take the fall.\n\nI understand nervous laughter, but I cannot think of a worse scenario for laughing uncontrollably. I wonder what it must be like for someone who has this condition: trying to convey an important message but being unable to do so. It must be a nightmare.",

    "text": "\n\nThe worst call I ever took didn’t have closure. Just a scream.\n\nYoung male caller. Maybe 20. Obvious cognitive delay. Screaming in agony and not the “I’m hurt” kind, the kind that turns your blood cold. I couldn’t understand him. It was pure panic, raw and wild.\n\nMy center was quiet that night. My coworkers could hear it through my headset and jumped in immediately. One ran records. One hit online tools. I checked every GPS resource we had.\n\nNothing. PH1 ping only. One tower. No address. No way to narrow it down.\n\nI kept trying to pull any word from him. Didn’t need a story. Just a location. Something. He tried saying something, and I repeated it back the way you do with someone who has a mouth full of marshmallows, just to see if we could land on anything.\n\nThe scream hit another pitch. Then the line went dead.\n\nRedial. Straight to voicemail.\n\nI kept repeating the sound he’d made, trying to find the shape of the word. My partner said:\n“Hathoway Park?”\n\nYes. Yes. That was it.\n\nShe had the neighboring agency’s call board open. House fire in progress. We passed along what we had. A few minutes later:\n\n“We have two code black.”\n\n\n\nAnd that was that.\n\n\n\nBut for me? it wasn’t.\n\nThat scream didn’t leave when the call ended. It stayed in the room. In my ears. In my chest.\n\nI kept thinking about what I missed. What I could’ve done. If there was anything that would’ve changed the outcome.\n\nI didn’t spiral. I functioned. I showed up to work. But something shifted.\n\nI got quiet. Not the “zen” kind. But the kind where you're watching your own thoughts too closely, waiting for them to settle.\nThey didn’t.\n\nThat call changed something in me. Not with a bang, but a slow drag.\n\n\nI’m not sharing this for pity. Most of you reading this already know.\n\nYou’ve heard the scream too.\nOr the silence.\nOr the sound of CPR compressions from someone’s living room while a toddler cries in the background.\nOr the tone of a dispatcher doing everything right — knowing it still won’t be enough.\n\nWe don’t always talk about it. But we know.\n\nJust putting this one out there in case it gives someone else permission to name what they’ve been carrying.\n\nStay safe out there.\n\n\n\n",

Worth missing family stuff, being tired all the time, worth the emotional trauma this job (and this call) caused/causes. This one thing makes it all worth all the pain and sacrifice.\n\nAt the end of the call when I finally convinced him to put the rifle down on the porch and come out to the street with his hands up so we could help him, after two long, arduous and sometimes terrifying  hours, I heard the radio chatter that they couldn't see his hands as they were at his back. My heart fucking *sank*, but I stayed calm and asked him if his hands were up. His answer was, and this is a direct and verbatim quote:\n\n\"Hemorrhoids. I have hemorrhoids and them shits are falling out, I gotta hold them in! I been bleeding for days!\"\n\nHe is at the hospital now and getting help for his emotional issues and, I sincerely hope, those hemorrhoids. I love this job and I will never do another as long as I am able.\n\nnote: this is a 100% true story. I might talk more about how it went later but for right now I really just need some Earl Gray tea and to play with my new kittens.

The guy who called (another very young adult) was gobsmacked, said his friend shot himself. We got the pertinent info and then this kid just started asking us to call his mom. He had tried to call her first and she didn't answer.\n\nWe respond, male in the driver's seat of a car, GSW to head, appears self inflicted, corroborated by the caller and two other males on scene. He had vitals (not that it changes anything; my agency transports *every* witnessed code no matter what) so they transport to the nearest trauma hospital. An hour later after notifications were made, the OIC calls in that he is deceased. \n\nAll of this, while sad and tragic for the guys on scene and especially the victim's family, is pretty cut and dried. It was somewhat odd that there were three other guys on scene who could confirm a suicide but nothing really eye catching.\n\nLater that night we got the full story. At around 0100 our victim calls three of his buddies and says \"we are getting food, I will pick you up.\" He does and they get food and are cruising through town bullshitting. Normal night for young guys. \n\nA bit later after some cruising around, the victim says he wants to show them something. So he drives to a random street in town, stops in front of a random house and parks the car. Without a word, he pulls out a gun and with no hesitation puts the gun to his head and shoots himself in the head with his three friends in the car with him.\n\nHe never said a word. No issues known to friends or family. Good kid, good life, happy kid, no drugs, no alcohol. Never said a word and did that in front of his best friends. Why do that to them? \n\nSenseless.",

    "text": "Asked by a domestic violence victim at the end of our call. I'd literally heard this woman get beaten up while the line was open, and this was when she started to cry. She only spoke Spanish (I'm fluent), and she was fucking terrified that we'd send an ICE officer over there while she was getting patched up by ambo.\n\nI assured her that no, that's not how this works; my county (I'm on the west coast) doesn't do that. It's not our job, and our chief has straight up said that we won't be cooperating with ICE unless absolutely necessary. She seemed a little reassured by this.\n\nIt's already so hard for DV victims to seek help. The fear of getting deported/getting their families deported is making it worse. I don't even want to think about how many other victims are keeping their mouths shut because of this. I'm not trying to be political here; this is just the fact of the matter in my area.\n\nOh, and for the cherry on top? I also got a call demanding we send an officer out to investigate \"three illegals.\" The caller insisted that because these people were speaking Spanish amongst themselves and \"acting suspicious,\" they were illegals. Here's the thing: this caller had an accent thicker than molasses. \n\nEdit to add: I had hoped that the second call would illustrate why the current political climate makes it harder for legal immigrants to get help as well. They have a lot to fear, and I'd like to be able to tell the ones in my county - legal or not - that they're safe to report a crime or call for paramedics.

The other dispatchers heard it all and they didn't seem to joke around with me or tease me after that. I think they knew I was going to quit before I did. I only worked for a month after that, so in total I was there less than a year.\n\nWhen I sheepishly asked the supervisor how to put in my 2-weeks-notice, she said something like, \"Why would you want to work here another two weeks?\" I gave her my pager and my key, she gave me a big hug, and she quickly recommended me for a low-stress campus PD dispatch job. She was great.\n\nI later got ~~legit~~ PTSD in the military and I don't think about those experiences as often as that awful 911 call. In fact, I don't even think I've discussed it with my army buddies or a therapist or anyone except cops.

    "text": "So I recently applied to join the police, and yesterday I went in for the polygraph. Well… it didn't go well. I actually got kicked out during the calibration (\"test questions\") phase because they said I was trying to \"manipulate the test\" - things like breathing irregularly, moving around, etc. Honestly, I wasn't trying to game the system at all. I was probably just overthinking everything as I'm explaining below.\n\nFor example, one of the questions was: \"Have you committed any crimes since 2020?\" Now, as far as I know, no, I haven't. But the moment they asked it, my brain went into overdrive: What if I unknowingly did something that counts as a crime? What if I misremembered something? If they had phrased it like \"Have you knowingly and intentionally committed a crime?\" then my answer would've been a solid \"No.\" But that vague wording just made me spiral.\n\nSame with the question about drugs: \"Have you used any illegal drugs or substances in the past 5 years?\" Again, I said \"No,\" because I genuinely haven't to my knowledge. But then I started questioning what counts as a \"banned substance\" - like, what if I took something over-the-counter that's technically on some list I don't know about?\n\nAnyway, they tried calibrating the polygraph twice, and then told me to go home while they discuss whether I'll get a reschedule. But even if they do give me another try, I'm pretty sure it'll go exactly the same way. I'm not trying to hide anything - I probably just think too much.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar?",

    "text": "I am a new hire at my local E911 center in a very rural county. I just finished up my first week and I think I’m going to really like the job, but I’m worried I’m going to get washed out. \n\nIt was my fourth day and so far I’ve just been listening to calls and writing up mock CADs for them. I struggle a bit with catching addresses, so that’s been my biggest focus. This call was a mother who’s teenage son overdosed, and I broke down while listening to her. \nIt was silent crying, mostly just wiping my eyes and nose with my sleeve and I still caught everything to put in the CAD. I know my trainer saw me crying, but he never said anything about it. I stopped crying right after the call was finished (the kid was okay after narcan was administered), and the rest of the night went fine.\n\nAm I going to get fired? Will they see it as a sign I’m not emotionally capable of the job? I’ve worked in high stress jobs before and I think I’d be fine if I was the one in the hot seat, but it was so hard to listen and not be able to help. I really like this job so far and want it to work out, but I’m worried I don’t fit in with the other dispatchers. \n\nMy only protection from getting let go is that we are a very small center and I’m the hire who brought it up to full staff, but I’m still worried. \n\nAny advice?\n\nUPDATE: \n\nI just finished up my first month and it turns out I had nothing to worry about. \n\nMost of my coworkers are very kind and as cliche as it sounds it actually feels like a little family. I am loving the job so far and have quickly learned how to distance myself from difficult calls. \n\nI am still trying to decide if I want to settle into dispatching as a lifelong career or if I want to try to go to grad school. \nI enjoy what I’m doing, but watching the others work themselves to exhaustion covering shifts doesn’t instill me with much confidence. We only have 13 dispatchers including myself and another trainee, so employees are averaging 50-60 hours a week at the least. \nI just don’t want the majority of my life to be spent at work. \n\nIf anybody has advice about dealing with mandatory overtime and short staffing I’d be happy to hear it!

We've all heard it.\n\nIt's no biggie, I am not top on the list. I'm pretty sure you know what's next.\n\nTwenty minutes later and there's the supervisor standing at my desk, looking down at me.

How??? \n\nI have been at my current agency two years and have never, not once, not even have I *imagined* refusing an order to stay over. Mandatory. Force, whatever it's called where you are.\n\nNot one but TWO people above me on the list say no. One of them is only here 9 months. The other just over two years. They do this frequently. Neither of them work tonight like I do. They don't give a fuck. They are going home to a nice warm bed while I will have to do an 8 hour turnaround when I live 45 minutes away for my 4th 12 in a row after a 16. \n\nI hate the fact that we are so short staffed that management knows they can't enforce the refusal rules to the letter or they will lose another 25% of the staff. These insensitive and callous people have learned that. Last year when things were staffed they would be looking down the barrel of a 3 day suspension. Not now. So the people like me who care and will do anything to not have \"refuses orders\" on their name and reputation get fucked over again and again.\n\nIt gets old.

    "text": "I have been dispatching for over 3 years now and have always had it drilled into me that everything an officer requests must be on a recorded line and everything you do for them must be recorded. Even if it's just a simple status check and they are seriously standing right in front of you (yes annoying but it's what I've been taught). Well last night I witnessed one of our newer dispatchers take a call on their personal cell phone and ran someone through NCIC/CCIC for the person on the other end of the call. Well I mentioned it to the person that they can't be doing that and the response was \"well they did it to\" and pointed to the other dispatcher we were working with. I have never witnessed them doing this but responded with \"well they shouldn't be doing it either\". Well because of my training, my ethics, and literally what is in the training to get CBI clearance I did email my supervisor to let them know. I live by CYA and refuse to screw up my career for someone else. Before leaving I stopped and told both of them that I was very sorry but I did have to let our supervisor know of the incident. The person who did it just knodded but didn't say anything and the other person said \"well you said something so.\" In a very snarky and rude way and then I left. \n\nI know on my heart I did the right thing simply because this was a security breach and if they are willing to do this on a non recorded line how much are they willing to just run or how many times have they done this in the past and we have no way to verify if it was actually for an LEO or not. Now I'm starting my 10 days off and I have no clue what I'm going to be walking into when I come back. \n\nI know a lot of people believe in MYOB but I don't think that's the right thing in this situation. Would anyone else have done the same thing and said something? I guess I just want to know that I'm not the only one who would do this. I'm just very disappointed that two people who I truly enjoy working with a like as people who do this. \n\n***Edit***\nThank you to everyone who has commented. For the most part it seems that I'm not alone in knowing this is something. That needed to be reported. I truly appreciate all comments on this even if they don't align with what I did. After being able to spend some time thinking about this I definitely wouldn't have ignored it. Probably wouldn't have let them know that I reported it but the view point of how it may have appeared to them was not part of my thought process. I have goals of where I want this career path to take me and I feel as though they would have been derailed if I didn't say anything. I'm still disappointed that people that I trusted and worked with put me in this situation but I know that I have it in me to do the right thing. ",

After experiencing what I experienced only a year and a half into my career I want to try to help provide others with the tools to try beginning the healing process after a traumatic event.\n\nI know that many of us have experienced trauma at some point in our careers as dispatchers. I had someone suggest to me of writing a letter about the incident as a means to seek some closure or relief from the call. This letter is going to be the ending that you never got to say. Your goodbye, your heart, your pain, your hope that they heard you, and your reminder to yourself: \"I stayed and did not let them go alone.\"\n\nI have dealt with this feeling of guilt and fear since the incident. Tonight, I finally made the choice to do this, and I feel a lot better. Tonight was a struggle emotionally until I had gotten my letter written. I know that with reddit things can be made public such as sharing and all that. I want to give everyone here who has had that experience to write anonymously what they wish they could say to that caller if they would have known it was the end. I have included my letter as an example. I would love to hear what others have to say about what they have experienced but this letter can be kept to yourself . I just hope that if there are some people out there struggling that they are able to use this as a place to start. \n\nif you are willing to share your letter here (following community rules of course) please do so. I know that I am not the only one. \n\n\n\n(Caller), I know that you do not know me, but I took calls from you prior to that dreadful night. That night, I didn’t know that it was going to be your final moments—not until after it had already passed. Even after it had passed, I still clung to hope that you would somehow answer the phone, or I would hear officers call out that they were with you. Answering your call for help, I knew something was wrong, but I did not know what it was. I sent help to you as fast as I could. Your delayed responses told me that something was wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on what had happened. I saw the history with your phone number, but nothing could have prepared me for what you were about to tell me. \n\n“My husband is shooting me!!” You telling me about your husband shooting you caught me off guard. I knew that help was on the way but this is where I had stumbled. I had felt as if something had changed. There was a new stiffness in the air as I continued to question you about where your husband was and who else was there with you. I know that we had discussed how to try to stop the bleeding as well. Then I heard one last gunshot from on the phone. My heart sank; I could no longer hear your breaths. All I could hear was what was going on the background. I could hear your dogs whimpering around the phone. This I believe now was them trying to get you to respond. I could hear officers yelling into the house for someone to come out. \n\nI clung to our phone call still even after I heard the gunshot. I continued to try to get you to answer me. I tried to get you to go to the door. I kept telling you the officers are there to help you and to keep trying to get to the door and they WILL help you. My coworker called your husband and when he told us that you were no longer apart of the land of the living we asked how he knows. He stated, “because I shot her.” I knew that I could not stay on the phone with you any longer because there were other calls that needed to be answered. I continued to help not only your friends but people who knew your husband continue to help officers in trying to get him to come out of the house peacefully. I reassured people who you were close with that we had help there and that we were doing everything we could. You were not supposed to die like that. You didn’t deserve that. \n\nWhat I want you to know is that I tried my hardest to get help to you as fast as possible. Even though it was not until close to when you passed; you telling me that your husband was shooting you saved so many lives that night. It was not me who saved them. YOU DID THAT. Since then, I still carry your voice with me and saying that your husband is shooting you. That night changed me, and I wish I would have gotten Police there sooner. \n\nYour voice has stayed with me along with the other things that were said in the background. Your voice is the clearest of all of them all. The silence after the gunshot is what has stayed and haunted me beyond just your voice. You may not have heard me, but I believe that somehow part of you knew that I was there. I did not leave you. Sometimes I still wonder what else I could have done better or more to save you. I know that I tried to walk you through how to try to stop the bleeding. I know that I showed up when you needed me the most. I stayed with you so you were not alone. I gave everything I had in that moment, and you were not alone in the end. \n\nI am choosing to let this moment go—not to forget, but to release the grip that this has had on my heart. This pain is real, but I cannot live inside it forever. YOU MATTERED. YOU STILL MATTER. And I WILL carry your memory forward not as a wound but as a reason to keep caring.",

    "text": "We finished up a round of interviews about a month ago. Been pondering a few of the things that we saw. \n\n- jeans and t-shirt for an interview. I’m sorry, but show some respect for the position and agency. Even if you’re nearly broke you should be able to find a pair of khakis and a golf shirt at goodwill for a song. \n\n- sucking on candy or sunflower seeds through the interview. Nah, friend… we need to get a feel for how well you can communicate *without* crap in your mouth. (Admittedly, talking around food is a valid job skill for us, but still…)\n\n- not having a clear answer for the simplest questions; the predictable ones, e.g., “What skills or abilities do you bring to this position?”\n\n- when asked for five year goals your answer is “I want to be a cop/firefighter/medic, this seems like an easy way to start.” Nope. No shade for someone who wants to be any of those things, but don’t come in and say you just want this til your real job opens up. (An interview a cycle or two back knew the *start date of the next academy class* and told us they only wanted to dispatch ‘til then.)\n\n- have no questions about the agency at all. We cover a lot in our “about us” spiel, but that should prompt some kind of curiosity or digging deeper. We want that. Inquisitive is a positive job trait. Ask about promotion opportunities, or outside details, or the training path, or benefits, or schedule…\n\n- make some eye contact. Staring down at a table for an entire interview is not inspiring. \n\n- don’t come in to an interview and announce that you can’t work X schedule. This is a 24-7 job and “I can’t work weekends” is a guaranteed decline. \n\n- make a joke! Have some confidence, find something easy to joke about. Local sports teams, weird weather changes, anything to break the ice a little bit. \n\nI get it. This job is kind of in the shadows and learning some of the fine points isn’t easy. I get that people don’t want to think of it as a career. I know some departments *do* use dispatch as a holding pattern for potential officers/FF/etc. \n\nBut… damn. When we interview for 2-3-4 DAYS to fill a couple spots, we know we’re investing 3-5 months in training, and - at least in our agency - you’re coming in to a civil service job with really decent pay and outstanding benefits. We want to get a return on our investment, and make this an attractive place for you to be for 5-10-20+ years!",

    "text": "I would like to get some anecdotal feedback. Overall, dispatch tends to be female dominated, but also has a a fairly short average career length (due to several factors, but overall, I think the tendency of agencies to treat it as a job rather than a career: lack of training opportunities, lack of career advancement opportunities, lower pay, less recognition for the value contributed, et cetera).\n\nIn my local area, I've noticed that a good amount of our long-term \"career\" dispatchers have been men. I'm think the 10-20+ years types. I'm wondering what other people's experiences are.\n\nAlso, quick shout out to dispatchers everywhere. The job is HARD. The career is hard.

My biggest weakness is and has always been my confidence. I am by far the youngest dispatcher and I let that get to me for a while because I felt less because of my age. Something I’m still working on because like I said I adore this job. I’ve taken some intense calls. An almost baby delivery but the ambulance beat me to it, a hanging, so many structure fires. The thrill of this job is something that gets me up every day because I truly feel like I’m helping people. But I still haven’t gotten a CPR call. Every single person in the center has at least once, they’re pretty common. Our two newest trainees both got their CPR’s. It’s a stupid thing to be so upset about but I feel like the laughing stock of it. Everyone texts me when they or their trainee got a CPR call. It’s been a long joke. And I’m good at taking jokes, so why isn’t this funny to me? I can’t go one shift without hearing, “You STILL haven’t gotten a CPR call?” Like I said, I know it’s a stupid thing to be upset about but I truly feel like I’m looked at as incompetent because I still haven’t gotten that experience. It’s just the luck of the draw. One of the trainees first 911 call was a CPR call. I know I can’t control what calls i get and like I said, I’ve gotten some doozies. But I just feel so shitty overall. I’m tired of hearing about my inexperience every single day. I’m tired of officers coming in to visit, and going, “Oh you’re the one who still hasn’t gotten a CPR??” Or “have you gotten your save yet?” It’s incredibly discouraging and I don’t know how to handle it.

    "text": "To all the new guys out there I want to shed some light on a few COMMON questions that I have seen on here that have been asked a few times. I know within the first few weeks to months can be really hard. It can feel as if you are not ment for the job and so on. IT DOES GET BETTER. Just give it time. One thing that I have been told over and over is that It can take years for someone new to the profession up to 3 years to start to be able to handle ALL aspects of the job on their own. I have been doing this job for 2.5 years and I still have questions... \n\nThere are ways of finding closure. Start with you command staff and supervisors. Please reach out to them as they have the ability to try to reach out to who can find you answers. As painful not knowing seems sometimes it is BETTER than knowing what happened. You guys have heard my end of what happened on the night that broke me and I am still finding ways to cope with it. Things do get better but remember you need to find those who are able to guide you the right way. Please don't turn too drugs and alcohol as a coping mechanism. \n\nWhen it comes to the stress of the job you need to learn different ways of coping with it outside of work as well. I have learned this one the hard way. I was not managing my and it crushed me for a while to the point where I was physically sick. Imwhen I found a way to manage it for me I was able to return to work and work past it. I would highly recommend to try hobbies where YOU are in control. For me it was photography. It gave me the ability to control ALL OF WHAT I WAS DOING rather than having no control. \n\nWhen it comes to relationships with your co workers. Don't be afraid of having that hard conversation. Believe me or not but it will go a long way. Those hard conversations are going to show who you really are and is going to allow you to grow not only professionally but also as an individual because over time you will start to use these skills outsude of work.\n\nOne of the things that I struggle with is the lose of emotion. I have blocked the emotion out for so long that it IS affecting my family and I am scared. I don't want to lose them because of the career path that u have chosen. I have been dealing with my mental health because of the shooting that I had and it has been rough. I have lost touch with myself and I am learning to live with the anxiety and the PTSD from it. That has been the hardest part. ",

I’ll be honest with everyone here, I thought I’d be happier getting this offer. I thought it’d make me feel good, that I’d finally be starting life with a promising career I guess. The annual salary is great with the benefits I’d get as a 20 year old, nothing seems to be wrong with my offer. But, if I’m going to be even more honest with everyone, I just don’t feel good about it. I feel the complete opposite. \n\nI’m nervous I’m not the person to be doing this kind of job, I’m not necessarily afraid to fail but I’m for some reason anxious about all of this. Not in a typical anxious change way, but in a dreadful kind of way. I don’t know why I feel like that, I mean, I know so many people who’d kill to actually get an offer like the one I have. I just don’t know why I don’t feel good about it. \n\nI haven’t accepted the offer yet, I can choose to not go through with this or go in the following week to get my signature on the paperwork. Feeling extremely lost and confused. I’d love to know if what I’m feeling is at all relatable or normal. ",

    "text": "Hi fellow dispatchers,\n\nI got an offer to work in corrections. \nI'm considering this move for a couple reasons. \n\n-More physically active job \n-Long term better schedule \n-Higher salary\n-More advancement opportunities\n\nCorrectional officers at that agency can eventually move into regular day shifts once they have seniority. In my current agency, dispatchers are stuck in the same 2 days, 2 nights, 4 off schedule forever, regardless of seniority. \n\nThat's kind of a dealbreaker for me. What do yall think? \n\n\n\n\n\n",

    "text": "TLDR: feels like competition is stiff for entry level positions in high cost of living areas. What free or low cost certificates could improve my resume?\n\nI’m in a high cost of living area and have applied to four entry level dispatch positions. I’ve scored in the 90% range on Criti-Call and gotten two interviews. Two hiring managers wrote back saying they have enough better qualified applicants. I managed to get two interviews. One interview netted a thanks but you will not be considered further due to the number of more qualified applicants. That was 48 hrs later\n\nMy other interview took place in a city with $20k hiring bonus advertised. The supervisor who walked me into the panel room said their department had 11 open positions. After the interview, I was informed I would not be moving forward but they would hold on to my resume for the next round of hiring. It took about a week to get that feedback.  \n\nThese are all with departments about 20mins or less driving distance. I’m about to start applying to departments about 30-40mins drive away. Co-incidentally, the advertised salaries are generally higher than what I’ve applied to so far.\n\nSo besides getting CPR certified ($85 around me), what other educational investments can I make to improve my resume? I already have a 60 wpm typing certificate from adult school ($15). I see FEMA has a 3 hr course on disaster area dispatching that yields a certificate number. Any other low hanging fruit?",

    "text": "I’m contemplating leaving my job and joining the team with ResQ911 but would really love some honest feedback about the company and its employees from people who have used their services and from those that work for them. I have dispatched for 27 years and have been everything from call taker and dispatcher, to a supervisor. However, I’ve always wanted to travel and this seems like a way to do that while serving my 911 family as well. The main concern that I have is the potential instability of it. Also, I already make nearly the same salary that they are offering and my insurance is already taken care of and I own my home. So I may lose pay by going this route. Any information anyone could provide would be helpful. Thank you",

    "title": "How likely is it for me to become a 911 dispatcher?",
    "text": "I (18f Seattle, WA) have been wanting to become a 911 dispatcher for years, it has always been a job I've been interested in. Recently I spoke with my family about this and some people have just told me not to, some told me I may want to wait a few years till I actually consider this, which I understand and take into consideration, but this is really one of the only career choices that I have found myself interested in and passionate about.\n\nThroughout my research in this career, I've realized this will be a high stress job, and will take quite a mental toll on me. Which aren't things I am to worried about, I've had to deal with very high stress situations in the past and managed it very well.\n\nSome skills I have which I feel pertains to the job...  \n\\-I have fairly good communication skills, which also includes decent grammar.  \n\\-Time management skills (I've been told that it is a big-time commitment and is often unforgiving in that regard)  \n\\-I'm good under pressure and know how to control my emotions in stressful situations.  \n\\-Typing skills (65-80 wpm on average)\n\nAlso, I know that there is a background check, which I am slightly worried about. I had an incident a few years back; I was 15-16 I think. I was staying with sister for a few weeks and she didn't have food, nor the money to buy food, so my cousin and I stole food from a store. The cops came, (there were 2 sheriffs), we weren't detained, although, they did take our names and information, and we were trespassed from that store. And at one point when I was younger, I was self-admitted into the hospital for a mental evaluation (It wasn't an overnight stay, and if it's relevant, it was because I attempted to take my own life) but they deemed I was okay and that it was a onetime incident. I also didn't do well in school until 12th grade, so before then, I had hundreds of absents and pretty bad grades (That was because I had to care for family and was having issues with some people at my school, amongst various other factors). But in grade 12, I got very good grades, barely missed school, got 128 service hours (volunteer work), and even did some college courses. (I'm not sure if this matters, but I am currently going to college to study psychology and am also going to study communications)\n\nI'm wondering how likely is it for me to become a 911 dispatcher? I don't have any prior work experience I can put on my resume (I have done landscaping and small construction jobs 'off the books').\n\n**Questions I have**\n\n\\-Are there any courses I should take to prepare? Or things I should study?  \n\\-Are there any tips and suggestions you have for me?  \n\\-What are the hardest parts of the job?  \n\\-How do you stop yourself from burning out?  \n\\-On average, what does you work week look like/what is the schedule and hours?  \n\\-Do you struggle to separate work and personal life? What does that balance typically look like? How does this job effect your relationships (both platonic and not)?  \n\\-What are some things you wish you did differently in your career?  \n\\-Do you think the pay is enough for the work?  \n\\-What should I do to make myself a good candidate? (How should I present myself and prepare?)  \n\\-Should I wait a few years before applying? (If I do apply, it won't be until this coming summer, but I'm trying to prepare myself) And to add on to this, what is the youngest person you've worked with?  \n\\-What sort of mental toll does this job take on you?  \n\\-Are there many options to 'climb the ladder'?  \n\\-What is your average take home pay a month? What should I expect (salary wise) when just starting out?  \n\\-What are the best things about your job? What are the worst things about your job?  \n\\-What does the relationship between you and your coworkers look like?  \n\\-Do you have any advice for me?\n\nI know that is a lot of questions, but I really just want to know as much as I can before starting down this path and I'd really like to hear your insight, and if you perhaps have any questions for me, I am more than happy to answer.\n\nThank you for reading, any advice and help is welcomed. (Also I am not sure if I put the right \"Flaire\" on this post, so I apologize if I am wrong)",

    "title": "Re-applying",
    "text": "Hi All, I am considering reapplying for a dispatcher position in my area. I applied back in 2022, and made it through every step of the interview process, including the family interviews and Chiefs interview, and fell out at the final step which is the psych evaluation. I was super bummed about that, partially because I felt like the evaluator judged me by my application alone and didn't explore it at all with me. \nI have been in recovery from drugs (11 years) and alcohol (4 years now) and was very very honest on my application about all of this and still made it super far in the interview process. Everyone seemed to appreciate my honesty, but I'm not sure it was the best idea since I feel like it ultimately cost me the job. \n\nAnyway, the agency requires you to wait three years before applying again, and I noticed a position just became available so was considering applying. I have a very stable government job right now but it is incredibly boring, and I have always been drawn to the dispatching field. I would potentially be taking a $20,000 pay cut, at least initially and based on the base salary of the position in my area. I do not have children, but do have a very needy dog, so schedule flexibility is not an issue for me. \n\nI guess I am wondering if anyone has hit a similar roadblock (psych eval) in the past and has any advice or suggestions if I go through it again? Since I've already applied with the agency, I will have to disclose it all again as I don't want to lie. And is OT such a widely expected scenario that the pay cut would make sense? I know it depends on the area so folks cant guarantee it would be worth it. If you were in my position, would you make the switch, or have you? \n\nSorry if these are dumb questions and pardon my rant. Appreciate any advice! ",
