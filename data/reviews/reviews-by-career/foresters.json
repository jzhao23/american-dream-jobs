    "text": "The Province of New Brunswick in Eastern Canada has &lt;1% old-growth left. In the City of Saint John, residents of the Lorneville community recently made an unexpected discovery that was missed during the province’s environmental assessments: 300-400 year-old red spruce trees in the footprint of the proposed Spruce Lake Industrial Park expansion. Experts and the province’s own Technical Review Committee flagged this forest as **rare and significant**, yet there has been no commitment to protect it.\n\nEmail officials + donate (details below) to help protect one of NB’s oldest remaining forests.\n\n**What’s happening**  \nResidents are pushing to protect an old-growth forest in Saint John, Canada, while the city advances plans to replace it with a heavy industrial park.\n\n* Due to decades of clear-cutting, **New Brunswick now has &lt;1% old-growth forest** remaining.\n* The expansion of the Spruce Lake Industrial Park would ultimately impact up to \\~900 acres of old forest and wetlands along the Bay of Fundy, a critical migratory flyway and ecological hotspot.\n* Residents continue surveying the \\~900-acre site and keep finding exceptional old growth. Most recently (Sept. 15–17, 2025), several 300+-year-old red spruce were found inside areas slated for imminent clearing (gravel pads). One 355-year-old spruce was inches from being destroyed during a June 2024 bulldozed road for a geotechnical survey\n\n**Why this forest matters**\n\n* In early 2025, Lorneville residents documented **red spruce trees up to \\~400 years old** within the proposed footprint ([CTV coverage](https://www.ctvnews.ca/atlantic/new-brunswick/article/saint-john-warned-against-paving-old-growth-forest-and-putting-up-industrial-park/)).\n* The Acadia Forest Dendrochronology Lab called it “**the 3rd oldest known forest in New Brunswick**.”\n* The Phase 1 EIA (by Dillon Consulting) still described this forest as “**of relatively low economic and ecological value**” ([EIA registry](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/elg/environment/content/environmental_impactassessment/1635.html)).\n* The **Technical Review Committee (TRC)** called the discovery *significant*, a *rare occurrence in the province*, and a potential *biodiversity hotspot*—and noted meets criteria to be designated as a **Protected Natural Areas.**\n* Dendrochronologist **Ben Phillips**: *“This significant patch of old forest is among the oldest in New Brunswick and should be immediately protected.”* .\n\n**What we’re asking for**\n\n* A **thorough, independent old-growth survey** (not reliant on community volunteers).\n* **Immediate protection** of identified late-successional and old-growth stands.\n* A **commitment** from the City of Saint John, Regional Development Corporation (RDC), and Province of New Brunswick to strong forest management that addresses hydrology, edge effects, and habitat fragmentation.\n\nOnce old growth is gone, it’s gone forever. New Brunswick must do better to protect what little remains.\n\n**How you can help**\n\n**1) Email these government officials —** tell them to pause clearing, complete an independent old-growth survey, and protect qualifying stands:\n\nGilles.LePage@gnb.ca, Susan.holt@gnb.ca, John.Herron@gnb.ca, Ian.MacKinnon@sjip.ca, brian.irving@sjip.ca, Courtney.Johnson@gnb.ca, donna.reardon@saintjohn.ca, rob.kelly@gnb.ca, shaylyn.wallace@gnb.ca, Crystale.Harty@gnb.ca, christie.ward@gnb.ca, charbel.awad@gnb.ca, Joel.Dickinson@gnb.ca, francis.rioux@gnb.ca\n\n**Suggested subject**: Protect Saint John’s 400-year-old forest—pause Spruce Lake clearing  \n**Key points to include (copy/paste):**\n\n* NB has &lt;1% old-growth left; Spruce Lake contains 300–400-year-old red spruce and wetlands.\n* TRC called it rare, significant, and potentially meeting Protected Natural Areas criteria.\n* Commit to an independent old-growth survey and immediate protection of identified stands.\n\n**2) Support the legal challenge**  \nThe **Save Lorneville** group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/savelorneville) has filed a judicial review of City Council’s decision to designate 1,591 acres for heavy industry.

    "text": "🔥 The destruction of a 400-year-old forest, over 100 acres of coastal wetland, and critical migratory bird and wildlife habitat is imminent.\n\n🏘️ Lorneville Residents have been fighting this development for over a year. The Lorneville community is a historic coastal fishing village, home to 6^(th) and 7^(th) generation families. The land for the proposed industrial park was private land that was expropriated in the 1970s. Now, residents face clearcutting, wetland infilling, and heavy industry just 150 meters from their homes and water wells.\n\n🌳This is the 3^(rd) oldest known forest in all of New Brunswick, including a 400-year-old red spruce that germinated in the 1600s, before European settlement. New Brunswick is currently less than 1% old-growth due to incessant clear-cutting.\n\n🦆 132 acres of high-functioning wetland will be infilled, wetland that drains into Provincially Significant Wetland (PSW) salt marshes and the Bay of Fundy\n\n🐟 Watercourse buffers have been inexplicably reduced to 15 meters, down from the provincial standard of 30 meters, effectively turning the lifeblood of this ecosystem into drainage ditches.\n\n🫱🫲There has been a lack of meaningful First Nations consultation for this development, as stated in Wolastoqiyik letters to the city and province.\n\nWe cannot allow the Government of New Brunswick (GNB) to put a rubber stamp on a substandard Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) conducted by Dillon Consulting.

This plan would result in the destruction of one of New Brunswick’s last remaining old growth forests, including a 400-year-old red spruce and multiple other trees confirmed to be over 200 years old. Also highly concerning is the proposed infilling of over 100 acres of high-functioning wetland that drains into Provincially Significant Wetland salt marshes and the Bay of Fundy, and the proposed reduction of critical watercourse buffers down to 15-meters. Clearcutting and wetland infilling will all take place just 150 meters from residential properties and water wells used for drinking water.\n\nAccording to the Acadian Forest Dendrochronology Lab, this forest is the third oldest documented in the entire province, surpassed only by red spruce stands in Fundy National Park and the Little Salmon River Protected Natural Area. Less than 1% of New Brunswick’s forests are old growth, and this rare, irreplaceable ecosystem is located within Saint John city limits.\n\nTo destroy one of the most unique and valuable ecosystems in our entire province for an industrial park is short-sighted and irresponsible. Once this forest is gone, it is gone forever. I urge you to halt the rezoning and EIA process and reject this plan. Protecting the Lorneville forest is an opportunity for Saint John and New Brunswick to show real leadership in conservation, climate action, and respect for future generations.\n\nSincerely,  \n\\[Your Full Name\\]  \n\\[Your City or Community\\]  \n\\[Optional: Contact Info\\]\"\n\n**Link to EIA Documents:** [https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/elg/environment/content/environmental\\_impactassessment/1635.html](https://www2.gnb.ca/content/gnb/en/departments/elg/environment/content/environmental_impactassessment/1635.html)\n\n**Some of the Key EIA Issues:**\n\n·        The EIA characterizes this forest as “of relatively low ecological and economic value”, a forest that contains some of the oldest trees in the province, including the 4^(th) oldest known tree at 400 years old.\n\n·        The EIA explicitly states that building gravel pads on top of old-growth forest and associated wildlife habitat is “reversible”.\n\n·        Hundreds of acres of high-functioning wetland will be infilled and destroyed. The phase 1 area to be developed is 50% wetland (132 acres of wetland, \\~100 football fields) which provides critical ecological functions such as water cooling and stream flow support functions for watercourses draining into the salt marshes.\n\n·        The 15-meter watercourse buffer is well below provincial and global standards and will effectively reduce kilometers of watercourses to drainage ditches. These watercourses are the lifeblood of the local ecosystem and community of Lorneville.\n\n·        The bird survey conducted by Dillon Consulting occurred on a single day in July 24 revealing 27 distinct species, provides no detailed methodology, and omits relevant expertise. Dillon Consulting has refused to provide qualifications for personnel who conducted the survey. In contrast, the 2019 bird survey on the adjacent property for the Burchill Wind Farm, as part of an EIA conducted by Stantec, covered spring and fall migration seasons, a winter survey, a crepuscular survey, revealed hundreds of distinct species in the area, provided extensive methodology and detailed results, and provided the biologists and ornithologists involved in the survey.\n\n·        A dedicated rare plant survey is absent from the EIA. Instead, Dillon Consulting states that a plant survey was conducted by “incidental observation” during site visits for other field work. They again have refused to provide qualifications for personnel conducting this survey.\n\n·        The health of provincially significant wetlands (salt marshes) in Lorneville will be compromised with the destruction of upstream wetland and reduced watercourse buffer.\n\n·        The EIA only covers \\~25% of the proposed industrial park area (420 acres of the 1591 acres to be rezoned to heavy industry). The boundaries of the EIA assessment area are highly arbitrary and cut right through the middle of forest and wetland. Clearcutting at these arbitrary boundaries will destroy the ecosystem beyond the EIA area.\n\n·        This fragmented, piecemeal approach of the EIA downplays the ecological importance of the area and the impacts of its destruction on the greater ecosystem and our community.\n\n·        The treed buffer of 150 meters between residential and industry is highly insufficient given the high-risk land use scenario, where homes and water wells lie down-gradient of the proposed heavy industrial park. This proposed land use and buffer violates modern national and international best-practices.\n\n·        The high-risk scenario of infilling hundreds of acres of wetland upgradient of groundwater wells poses a public health risk.\n\n·        Clearcutting at the 150-meter buffer from residential will fragment wetland and compromise the long-term health of the trees within this buffer. The long-term sustainability of this buffer is highly questionable.\n\n·        The soil conditions in the proposed development area – loose soil over clay over rock – are highly conducive to ground vibrations produced by heavy machinery. Vibrations generated during land clearing and gravel pad construction may travel through clay and bedrock, causing structural damage to private wells and altering groundwater flow patterns.\n\n·        A basic ecological principle is that ecosystems function as interconnected systems. Salt marshes, watercourses, wetlands, forests, plants, animals, and lichens are interdependent components; damaging or removing one part can compromise the integrity of the whole. The EIA fails to acknowledge this interconnectedness, neglecting to assess the broader ecological consequences of destroying large areas of wetland and forest, including potential impacts on downstream salt marshes.\n\n**Further Information and Other Ways to Get Involved**\n\nSave Lorneville Mailing List: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6PLtWowRmbzO63AQt7PdtEkCOSquoqxgHWI7pv3DLByi4Aw/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6PLtWowRmbzO63AQt7PdtEkCOSquoqxgHWI7pv3DLByi4Aw/viewform)\n\nSave Lorneville Facebook Page: [https://www.facebook.com/groups/savelorneville](https://www.facebook.com/groups/savelorneville)\n\nSave Lorneville Instagram Page: [https://www.instagram.com/savelorneville/?hl=en](https://www.instagram.com/savelorneville/?hl=en)",

It doesn’t matter if they are constitutional or not. The purpose is to overwhelm and to invoke fear and chaos.

Lord knows we could get paid a lot more working for large industrial landowners and TIMOs/REITs and our jobs would most likely be easier. Most federal foresters I know care more about the mission and the camaraderie than we do the work-life balance. \n\nThese next four years are the time we will be tested. If you haven’t already and are able, join your union, get engaged, and let your friends and family know what’s going on. Don’t be silent. Start tracking legislation. We need to be involved now more than ever. The American public and our national forests are counting on us.

I thought the more time I spent learning about forestry - the more it would lessen, but that doesn't seem to be the case. I feel like I can't fit in with any of my forestry classmates. It's driving me insane. I feel like everyone knows something that I don't. Everyone seems to have twice the experience and connections I have. Further, I'm like one of two non-white students in my entire program. It shouldn't matter but I feel like it does. \n\nI feel like I can't connect with anyone.

Which sucks because I really do love forestry. \n\nI guess I'm wondering if it's better out in the industry? are people more accepting of others from different backgrounds? \n\n",

I know she won’t get rich in this career. But I don’t want her to get a degree in a profession that is likely to die either. I’ve already learned that forest management is probably the best approach rather than wildlife management (although she loves the idea of working with animals), since wildlife seems a lot like getting a degree in biology—it is very hard to get a job without graduate school.  And wildlife seems to be more dependent on public sector jobs, which are not in a good place right now. \n\nShe is a high school junior, so she would enter job market in about five years.

    "title": "Career Question Megathread",
    "text": "**Thinking About a Career in Forestry? Ask Your Questions Here!**\n\nAre you curious about working in forestry? Whether you’re:\n\n\\* A student wondering what forestry programs are like,\n\n\\* Considering a career change,\n\n\\* Unsure what jobs are out there (public vs. private sector, consulting, research),\n\n\\* Or just want to know what day-to-day fieldwork is like…\n\n**What is Forestry?**\n\nForestry is more than just trees—it’s a mix of science, management, and hands-on fieldwork. Foresters work in areas like:\n\n\\* Timber management – cruising, marking, harvest planning.\n\n\\* Ecology &amp; conservation – wildlife habitat, restoration, prescribed fire.\n\n\\* GIS &amp; remote sensing – mapping and data analysis.\n\n\\* Urban &amp; community forestry – managing city trees and green spaces.\n\nJobs can be found with state/federal agencies, private companies, non-profits, and consulting firms.\n\n**Resources for Career Exploration:**\n\n\\* Society of American Foresters (SAF): [safnet.org](http://safnet.org) – info on accredited degree programs and career paths.\n\n\\* U.S. Forest Service Careers: [fs.usda.gov/working-with-us/careers](http://fs.usda.gov/working-with-us/careers)\n\n\\* State Licensing/Certification: Some states require forester licenses—check your state’s forestry division.\n\n\\* Job Boards:\n\n\\* ForestryUSA\n\n\\* [USAJobs.gov](http://USAJobs.gov)\n\n\\* [https://www.canadian-forests.com/job.html](https://www.canadian-forests.com/job.html)\n\n\\* State and consulting forester job listings\n\n**How to Use This Thread**\n\n\\* Post your career questions in the comments below.\n\n\\* Foresters and forestry students: Jump in and share your experience!\n\n\\* If your question is very specific, you can still make a separate post—but this thread is where most career-related questions will be answered.\n\n**FAQs:**\n\n**1. Do I need a degree to work in forestry?**\n\nNot always. Many entry-level jobs (tree planting, timber stand improvement, trail work, wildland firefighting) don’t require a degree—just training and willingness to work outdoors. However, to become a professional forester (writing management plans, supervising harvests, working for agencies), most states and employers require at least a B.S. in Forestry or a related natural resources field, or verifiable experience.\n\n**2. What’s the difference between a forester and an arborist?**\n\nForesters manage forests at a landscape scale—hundreds to thousands of acres—balancing timber, wildlife, recreation, and conservation goals. Arborists (often ISA-certified) focus on individual trees, usually in urban or residential settings, with an emphasis on tree health, pruning, and hazard management. The two fields overlap but have very different day-to-day work.\n\n**3. Is forestry mostly outdoor work?**\n\nEarly in your career, yes. You’ll spend a lot of time cruising timber, marking trees, or collecting field data. Later, many foresters transition to a mix of office and field work—GIS mapping, writing management plans, and coordinating with landowners or agencies. If you love both the woods and data/analysis, forestry can offer a great balance.\n\n**4. What kind of pay and job outlook can I expect?**\n\nForestry isn’t known for high pay, but it offers solid job security, especially with public agencies and utilities. Entry-level wages are often in the **$35k–$45k** range for field techs, with professional foresters earning **$50k–$90k** depending on region and sector. Consulting foresters and utility vegetation managers can earn **&gt;$100k**, especially with experience or specialization.\n\n**Foresters, students, and career changers: Jump in below and share your paths, tips, and resources.**",

    "text": "Hi all, so I'm looking for some good entry level positions to get into some area of forestry. To help yall out on pointing me in the right direction, I am complete new to this field but not the outdoors. I have always been an Outdoors men, I know my way around nature, plant types, tree types, and I am a Eagle Scout so I got all my survival knowledge so lets just say I know more than your average joe. I don't care about the weather, I like hard work, and I'm no pussy so I can handle the extremes and the hours. The tricky thing is, as much of a Union jock as I sound, I went to film school and I specialize in Photography, Videography, and Editing and all my work experience is based in that creative space as well. I'm making this post cause the saying \"Starving artist\" is very true and I need a real \"normal person job\" or any job that I can provide me with steady pay so I can survive, and if I could get benefits that would be awesome. Another Issue I am having with my search is finding some trade job or any job that will allow me  the time to continue pursing my freelance photography and Videography. I understand that one is very tough to balance so I am willing to look into career options in this field that combine my creative skills with this stuff so I'm doing both. I know my requirements are very hard to hit and my lack of actual work experience in this field does limit me a lot. This field is my plan B and kind of my plan A too now. I really don't see myself in any other field but I'm open to suggestions. I live on Long Island, NY and I know my current locations defiantly limit my local work options, but I don't mind and would like to move off the island to where the work is. So If anyone has any company suggestion Gov or private, areas in this field that I should focus on and look into, Advice for getting hired, or know Jobs that would be a good fit I would greatly appreciate it. one other thing, in my research I did see a lot of Gov jobs having limited application periods, and a lot were seasonal. I don't mind but just to fill you in I still live with my parents, I don't hate them but they are very annoying, old, engineers, knows how to dish out plate filled of tough love, and requires me to have a full and detailed break down of any information for them to understand. The don't really care or like that I want to purse a career in Photography and Videography or care about all the major strides I've made on my own. They also think that there isn't longevity in Forestry cause \"Trump got rid of so much\", \"I'll have to deal with bad weather\", and \"I need a degree\" all fair but annoying points (yes my parents are extraordinarily suborn and I can never please them but that's a different topic). So sorry to info dump on you but maybe this might help you understand the type of answers/suggestions I'm looking for. I don't need people to do a complete break down I'll do that for myself, but I seriously apricate any help. ",

    "title": "Am I Doing Ok As A Technician or am I Making Too Many Mistakes?",
    "text": "I am in the middle of my second season as a technician with a timber company.  Before that I did a season as a tech with the forest service.  I am a 35 year old male; I got into forestry work fairly late in life as I started out as an arborist in my mid 20’s and made the decision to switch to forestry in my early 30’s.  My impression of technician work is that it may be entry level but it isn’t easy; there are guidelines to follow but things are often not straightforward and much of the time I just have to make my own calls out in the field and hope that later I was right.\n\nI have made many mistakes since I’ve been a technician, and I’ve beat myself up about it a lot.  I’ve lost sleep some nights, and some days I’ve gotten myself depressed thinking I’m not cut out for this work.  Last week was particularly bad for me which is what prompted me to write this post.  \n\nI will go over the mistakes I made last week, just so I can get an honest opinion on whether or not I am actually cut out for forestry as a career.\n\nThe first mistake happened when I was flagging a water course buffer; I didn’t pay attention to my Avenza map and I ended up blowing out past the property line for a few hundred feet.  It was an easy fix unfortunately my boss also saw me do it.  On the same day I was flagging a property line, and I wasn’t able to get the line straight in some places; the blazes (marks on trees made by surveyors to indicate ownership boundaries) and property signs were either too far apart or were in conflict with one another.\n\nThe next day I was marking trees with two other people on my team.  When we mark as a group we mark lines on brush or dead trees to create “outsides” that indicate strips of land where each person marks.  I screwed up pretty bad when I made my strip way too wide and caused us not to finish marking to the other road that we were trying to reach.  It wasn’t the end of the world, but it annoyed my team because it meant we would have to fill in the remaining area later.  To me it seems like the kind of mistake that is fine for a new person but I shouldn’t be doing that by my second season.\n\nThe last day I was criticized by the forester managing the timber harvest plan for being too aggressive in my marking (different area from the previous day).  I’d been too hard on marking the white firs (fyi this is salvage marking), and I didn’t mark some large overmature ponderosa pines that I should have because I thought they needed to have significant scorch or be dying within a year to justify the mark but I was wrong.\n\nThis last week felt really rough for me, like I was making one mistake after another.  Now I feel miserable about it, wondering if I am actually cut out to be a forester.  Based on this example of one week, am I making too many mistakes for someone at my current stage of my forestry career or am I being too critical of myself?",

    "text": "Deutsch ist Unten!   \n  \nWasnt sure where to post this, hope this is the right section as this is a quite specific to germany. (Will definetly take advice from anyone! But, please make a mention if you have professional expierence IN germany, honestly am feeling pretty lost here, and time seems to be ticking)  \n  \nI am 33 years old German/American, have been in germany for 5 years, german is B2/C1. I am looking to start a career in forestry, though being a bit late. I have been on pursuit for a degree (after a prep school \"Studienkolleg\"), but am now considering how difficult it could be to find work at \\~37 years old with a Bachelors of Forestry (in german), but little hands on expierence aside from a few internships/Praktikums. Does it really make sense to spend 3 years on Vocational school/Ausbildung, work another 3 years as a technician to get expierence THEN study another 3 years? I feel like it would promise me work, as a forester, at 42yo, but is this the best way? I also thought about really hauling ass and just getting as much internship expierence as possible and get an additional certification/Weiterbildung while doing my bachelors... Would that be enough to secure me work as a Forester?\n\nAnother point is that deadlines to apply for this years Ausbildung is gone. I can at earliest start an Ausbildung the end of 2026... What a bummer!\n\nDeutsch:  \nIch bin 33 Jahre alt, Deutscher/Amerikaner, und lebe seit 5 Jahren in Deutschland. Mein Deutsch ist B2/C1. Ich möchte eine Karriere in der Forstwirtschaft anfangen, obwohl ich ein bisschen spät dran bin. Ich war auf der Suche nach einem Studium (nach einem Vorbereitungsjahr im Studienkolleg), aber jetzt überlege ich, wie schwierig es sein könnte, mit einem Bachelor in Forstwirtschaft (auf Deutsch) Arbeit zu finden, wenn ich wenig praktische Erfahrung habe, abgesehen von ein paar Praktika. Macht es wirklich Sinn, 3 Jahre Ausbildung zu verbringen, noch 3 Jahre als Forstwirt zu arbeiten, um Erfahrung zu sammeln, und DANN noch 3 Jahre zu studieren? Ich denke, es würde mir Arbeit als Forstwirt mit 42 Jahren versprechen, aber ist das der beste Weg? Ich habe auch darüber nachgedacht, richtig Gas zu geben und so viele Praktikumserfahrungen wie möglich zu sammeln und gleichzeitig eine zusätzliche Zertifizierung/Weiterbildung zu machen, während ich meinen Bachelor mache... Würde das ausreichen, um mir Arbeit als Forstwirt zu sichern?\n\nEin anderes Punkt ist, dass die Fristen für die Bewerbung für diese Jahr Ausbildung schon vorbei sind. Ich kann frühestens erst Ende 2026 eine Ausbildung anfangen... Was ein Pech!\n\nThanks so much for any advice. The past years have been rough, german bureaucracy is no joke, I've felt very  stuck and feel like I lost a lot of time jumping through hoops the past 5 years to get credits to study, which pretty much now have (no need to get into the full story, im just exhausted and need to find the right path).",

Some locations have been filled and duty station will depend on current staff positions.**  \n  \nFIA foresters travel the state, taking measurements on long-term fixed radius research plots. Oklahoma established many of these sites in 1936 and our data collection enables us to monitor forest health, observe disturbances and ecological responses to those disturbances, track succession, assess sustainability, quantify carbon balances, and more. FIA foresters collect data about tree measurements, forest health parameters, understory vegetation composition, habitat types, down dead woody material, silvicultural practices, natural disturbances, and land ownership. The job requires outdoor work 95% of the time and significant travel up to four days per week.   \n  \nOklahoma is a wildly diverse state with alligators and bald cypress in the SE, black bears and red oaks in the NE, honey mesquite and horny toads in the SW, and pronghorn, mesas, and ponderosa pine in the NW.

    "title": "TLDR: 24F working as a mechanical EIT, wanting to leave $80,000 salary job to go into forestry.",
    "text": "24F currently working as a Mechanical EIT (mechanical engineer in training) in Canada but have been considering a career switch into forestry. Basically, I never “loved” mechanical engineering but powered through the degree anyways. I was always told it’s a strong degree to have and that there are many career options out there…so I stayed. Looking back at university my favourite courses I took were Environmental Remediation and Physical Geography both of which were electives and not engineering core courses. I got into engineering as a bit of a fluke… In HS I realized I enjoyed science and math, applied to engineering and kinesiology but then opted for engineering because a lot of people told me it was hard to make a career out of kin and that I’d need additional schooling. \n\nI got interested in forestry after time spent tree planting in between university. I ended up planting for 3 seasons in Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia. Tree planting made me realize how much I love the bush and that I’m good at suffering (working in tough environments) lol. Since graduating engineering in 2024, I’ve been working for a mining company in Asset Integrity engineering. I’ve been with the company for almost 2 years now making it also almost 2 years since I last planted. In terms of engineering Asset Integrity work is probably one of the more “field-based” roles I could get as we often work with critical equipment, carry out inspections and write repair plans. However, despite the field work I still miss the bush and I don’t know if this career will be fulfilling long term for me.\n\nI’m interested in Forestry because I believe I would enjoy (and be fulfilled) with working outside,  I like science and it’s one of the only industries where you can (sometimes) bring a dog to work with you! And yes I have a dog. I’m open to doing more schooling as if I do venture into forestry I want to ensure I have stable career and can generate decent pay, etc. In terms of schooling I think I have a few options: Forestry Technician Diploma, Bachelor of Forestry, Masters of Forestry (although I’m not sure I can do a masters in forestry after an engineering degree). I’m leaning towards the 2 year diploma option for now as I know RFT is beneficial and I could always do more school to become a RFP.\n\nQuestions:\n- Has anyone made a similar switch? And was it worth it? \n- What forestry schooling in Canada is best and why? (Diploma, Degree, Masters)\n- What does the future of forestry look like for Canada? Is it stable?\n- Anything else I should know about Canadas Forestry Industry?\n- Do you feel fulfilled by your career in Forestry?\n\nMy plan right now is to look into forest fire fighting and prospecting for the 2026 summer and then potentially go to forestry school in the fall.\n\nMy Cons:\n- Forestry salary is likely lower than the salary in engineering\n- I will likely have to do more schooling before working in this field \n\nMy Pros:\n- I’d get to work in beautiful places that not many people see\n- I’d get to be on my feet and not sit at a desk all day\n- I’d have the option to move into an office based role later in the career\n- Dogs can (sometimes) come to work\n",

    "text": "Hello people,\n\nI am coming to search for perspective/opinions/informed advice/life experience. I have discovered forestry very recently during my search for MSc degrees, and it piqued my interest.\n\nFor context, I am doing a double major BSc in Cell Biology and Mathematics (read mostly anything relevant for tech, like Calculus I, II, III, Linear Algebra, Discrete Mathematics, Programming, Statistics). Up until now, I had been heavily leaning towards pursuing an MSc in fields such as Computational Sciences or Scientific Computing, but I weighed that against the possibility of spending my life solely behind a computer, and I am not sure how I feel about that (hint: it is scary). \n\n  \nForestry, namely forest engineering/biometrics/GIS, is therefore very interesting because it seems to have occasional interaction with the field. I have been crawling on the internet for the past week, trying to figure out what the job prospects and salaries might be in Europe, and the outcomes are very mixed. I do not aim to be some magnate, but I also do not want to go into this with the prospect that I might not be able to save up.\n\nWhat are your takes on this? Should I just try the more general master's in Computation and head into the field later, or should I try to go for something more specific, like Forestry in Goettingen, which offers more focus on ecology? \n\nI am quite lost with this, as some sources claim you could learn ecology knowledge on the job, and some say otherwise.\n\nHas anyone considered or pursued a similar shift in path, and how has it worked out for you? I am open to hearing any suggestions, even when it comes to specific degrees, universities, sectors, affiliated fields, etc.\n\nThank you so much!!",

I know I can't expect to make a whole lot of money, but I know that this particular organization doesn't pay super well even at the higher levels, and I guess I'm just looking for some reason for optimism if I do commit to forestry that I will be able to make a comfortable salary within not too many years.
