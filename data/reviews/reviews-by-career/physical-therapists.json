    "text": "\n\nThe University of Pittsburgh is launching a Doctor of Chiropractic program alongside it’s DPT program, a move that threatens to legitimize a field rooted in outdated and dangerous ideas, such as subluxation theory and spinal manipulation for infants. \n\nLet’s be clear, this isn’t about a professional rivalry. This is about science. Chiropractic care, as it is still widely practiced today, includes interventions that are not supported by evidence, and in some cases are actively harmful. Despite what proponents claim, high velocity spinal manipulation is still being marketed for newborns and immune system boosting and even ADHD without valid clinical backing. \n\nWe worked hard to make physical therapy a respected, evidence-based medical profession. Letting a university give equal academic footing to chiropractic care without holding it to the same standards of scientific scrutiny undermine everything we’ve built. \n\nSign the petition to stand up for science back to care and for patient safety.\n\nTell Pitt and other institutions pseudoscience does not belong in our universities!",

Good start, let's pack on patients to your schedule to the point where you have 4 of them come in at the same time, don't worry we will give you one underqualified college kid as an aid to split between you and your co-workers for support. Don't forget about all the notes from the 16+ patients you saw today! Lunch? At your desk! Try shoving a couple of bites in between patients. The pay? I mean you get a paycheck, there won't be much in it but it's something! \n\nNo? Okay maybe acute care! Glove up friend and pin that nose shut because youll be covered in piss and shit a lot. Get that half conscious TKA up the stairs bud, we got money to make! Doc is yelling at you to get the drunk schizophrenic cleared for discharge? Is it safe? Maybe not, but it's not like your license is on the line or anything, Mod I for household distances it is. The pay? A little better but not by much. \n\nHmm maybe not. I think rehab is more your speed. I hope you don't like your back, or your shoulders, or your sanity, because they'll be gone within a couple months anyway. Keep documenting though! You got this! Management wants you to discharge faster? To see more? Noo prob! It's not like the patients complain every second of the day or anything to make your day even longer.\n\nAlright alright, so you want a nice chill pace, lots of money, and independence, I think homecare is for you. Will your patients get better? Prob not. Do they want PT? Debatable. Do they think you're a nurse? Yup! Will you have an absolute shit ton of notes to do when you get home? Hahahaha holy shit you will. Your contract may say 40 hours but we all know that's bullshit, schedule everything yourself, do all the notes, drive around like a madman, and go see your patients. Your life after work? Uh you're a PT, that's not a choice anymore. It'll be a blast! \n\nAnd don't forget, no matter where you go, you can always take comfort in the unreasonable amount of debt to income ratio you have to make you feel all warm and fuzzy inside. And that \"Doctor\" title! Wow. Will anybody ever call you doctor? No. But I guess its cool you know? \n\nI've been treating for two years and this has been my reality.

    "title": "Third NPTE Retake, PASS, and tips",
    "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI made a post back in July that I didn't pass on my second attempt, but I'm making another one now because I FINALLY PASSED on this third try. It's definitely been a rollercoaster of emotions these last couple months of restudying for it. I honestly really contemplated giving up on PT all together because I was so burnt out from studying. \n\nI want to let everyone know who weren't able to pass on this most recent attempt that I BELIEVE in you. For those who are planning to retake it in January, one of the best advice I got was to make sure you take breaks. If you're anything like me, I always tend to overstudy but we need to remind ourselves that these breaks helps refuel our energy to study again. We're not robots and we need time to consolidate the information. With that said make sure to enjoy the holidays. Spend time with friends and family and make sure you don't put your life on hold for this test. The NPTE will always be there, but the memories we choose to make now won't. \n\nAlso, if you're wondering in terms of the material what helped me pass. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing for the NPTE breakdown report for 100$ and TherapyEd's 3x practice exams for 100$ (total of 200$). The NPTE breakdown report helps show what your strengths/weaknesses are for the subjects, at which points of the test did the fatigue kick in, &amp; etc. The therapyed practice exams were BY FAR the closest thing to the NPTE that I've taken. What's cool about it is like the NPTE breakdown report it'll show what your strengths/weaknesses on the subjects are and rationales for why questions you got were correct/incorrect, and a score which indicates how ready you are after taking the test. I've taken so many practice exams like the PEATS from the NPTE website, final frontier practice exams, practice exams I found online, but TherapyEd BY FAR was the best in my opinion. \n\nAdditionally, HONE in on your MSK, cardiopulm, neuro, and differential diagnoses material. I've taken over 3000 questions during my second attempt and taking questions mindlessly will get you nowhere. If you have a really good understanding of the 3 subjects, you'll pretty much understand 80% of the test. For example really understand what the purposes of this special test is, why this muscle has this action/innervation will cause this impairment ex: during gait, why would a patient with a damaged deep fibular nerve demonstrate circumduction during swing phase of gait (because they're unable to clear their limb due to a weakened anterior tib muscle that is not dorsiflexing during swing), differentiate diagnoses like if a patient demonstrates bilateral LE edema, is it CHF, lymphedema, kidney failure, etc. Understand cardio pulmonary diseases restrictive vs. obstructive, different neurological diseases, and outcome measures! The outcome measure questions come out alot in those 3 part case scenario questions so be able to understand that this outcome measure for example the Stroke IMPACT scale (SIS) is a SELF-REPORTED questionnaire vs. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is an actual measure of stroke severity. These were just random questions that popped into my head while restudying it, but REALLY UNDERSTAND the 3 core subjects and not move on if something is not making sense to you. It is not a waste of time. \n\nLastly, if you made it this far. YOU ARE GOING TO PASS AND NEVER NEED TO STUDY/TAKE THIS STUPID TEST AGAIN. Believe me when I say I know all the emotions you're feeling because I've been in your shoes twice already. YOU WILL PASS AND I BELIEVE IN YOU. My friend once told me that life is tough and will probably only get harder from here, but you can only get stronger 💪💪. GOOD LUCK on this last time you will ever study for this test and HAPPY HOLIDAYS from the bottom of my heart!!!!!",

I tried speaking out this past year and was swiftly punished with false accusations and watched my performance rating plummet from “excelling” to “developing,” just a step away from termination. I vented on the PT subreddit, desperately seeking support, only to get reprimanded by administration for doing so. Tell me, where else are we supposed to turn? Facebook and other platforms are monitored, and we’re actively punished just for being honest about our struggles. Please don’t silence one of the only safe havens we have left. This isn’t an exaggeration; this is the grim reality of PT today. Without unions or advocacy, we’re left alone and penalized for even daring to speak up.",

    "text": "Good Morning Everyone,\n\n\nAs part of our new community outreach program, I'm excited to make our first reddit post and begin our ongoing dialogue. As we've interacting with clinicians in the beginning of 2025, we've heard about the numerous challenges you've been facing. The cuts to reimbursements, the interactions you've had with other types of providers, and the concerns over the financial health of the profession. We know how stressful this can be, especially now with more uncertainty regarding the overall economy. I personally see this everyday when interacting with the clinicians in my local area.\n\nAnd many of you have asked, how does the APTA plan to react to this?\n\nRest assured, we've already begun taking action to make things better. In March, we ordered top of the line Herman-Miller office chairs for the new building, so employees can turn easier as to not have to look at what we call \"the poor side of the building\" where the Athletico is in view. Second, we hired my niece to do fun Tik-Tok dances and tag #PTcanBFun to help boost morale and improve social outreach. We expect this to increase the referrals to your clinic dramatically.\n\nWe've also come up with a comprehensive new budgeting tool to help PT's address their financial debts. We're proud to be partnering with DoorDash, in a program were calling \"oh by the way\", which we think will increase the awareness of the PT profession and help people #ChoosePT. APTA members should expect a detailed email in the coming days, with the general population probably hearing about it on the news in the coming weeks.\n\nBut remember, it won't be for the weak! #Grit\n\n-APTA",

After she made 8 comments of death in 2 visits (and that’s just when I started counting) I consulted with some of our other therapists and called their doctor. SPECIFICALLY I SAID THIS “we have a common pt and she’s making jokes of about end of life. I do not believe she is serious about doing anything and they have their daughter and husband as caregivers right now. She’s moving in August and voiced stress about this. I just needed to notify you due to some medications she has started taking may affect this”. \n\nThe drs office called her and said “hey just got a call from your PT at ______ location. Heard you’re pretty suicidal right now. What’s been happening?” \n\nI’m pretty pissed at them for how they handled this and called me out for it. She came in yelling at me and said I embarrassed her. Very understandable. I was able to calm her down and get her to continue working with me but I just wanted to rant about how unprofessional some offices are. ",

    "text": "Just need to vent. I am 12+ years into my PT career, outpatient ortho, and pelvic floor for the last 5. I am so tired. Just weary on a deep, soul level, of being there for, empathizing, supporting, caring, encouraging, coaching patient after patient after patient. I am most distressed that I have no emotional energy left for my own family. Is this career supposed to suck this much???\nI have loved this work but I'm socially exhausted. \n\nEdit: After many prayers, tears, and discussions with my spouse, I have decided to leave my job. I'm very thankful to have accepted another offer and I will be returning back to general outpatient ortho and take an indefinite break from pelvic health. I love the specialty but I've realized I cannot be a pelvic health therapist on a traditional outpatient ortho schedule. My managers have been so amazingly supportive but all the things we've done to improve my work sanity are getting destroyed by my company being bought out and the new regime demanding more productivity. Our big boss thinks we can see 4 patients an hour. I fear they will turn this place into a patient mill, and turn my amazing manager into a stressed out micro-manager. But I have the option to leave. So I am leaving. My hope is to eventually start my own small cash-pay, high quality, holistic wellness and pelvic health PT service, where I can treat patients in a way that helps them optimally AND allows me to be sane and healthy. For now, this new job will be 1:1 general PT, three 10 hour days. I'm praying it will give me a much less emotionally demanding job and let me decompress and recover from burn out. Thank you all for such an outpouring of support and understanding!",

    "title": "Not a PT - Just a Thank you &amp; gratitude!",
    "text": "I’m not a PT but a PT has changed the trajectory of my dad’s recovery and life so I wanted to just send an encouraging thank you to this profession. \n\nOn September 7th, my mom woke up to find my dad not breathing and without a pulse. She immediately called 911, and the dispatcher walked her through performing CPR until the ambulance arrived.\n\nOn the way to the hospital, the EMTs were able to resuscitate him with CPR and epinephrine, since he wasn’t shockable due to the lack of pulse. He was intubated immediately upon arrival and remained unresponsive, so they began targeted temperature management (cooling and rewarming) to help preserve brain and organ function.\n\nAfter 72 hours, he woke up and recognized me and my mom, and had movement on his left side, but not his right. A CT scan revealed that, on top of the cardiac arrest, he had suffered a brainstem stroke.\n\nHe spent 13 days in the ICU and was later transferred to the stroke unit, where he began physical, occupational, and speech therapy. His speech, swallowing, and cognition came back pretty quickly, but he was still very weak from both the stroke paralysis and being bedridden for nearly a month.\n\n\nDuring this time, the case manager applied for acute rehab. At first, he wasn’t approved because he was too weak. But one of the PTAs working with him asked one of the main rehab PTs to come evaluate him. Despite needing significant assistance, he was able to tolerate 45 minutes of activity.\n\n\nThat PT became his biggest advocate, and thanks to her pushing for him, he was approved for acute rehab. Now he’s making amazing progress, went from struggling to stand with assistance and now is down to minimal assistance with standing and transfers, and currently learning to walk again with a walker, and as of yesterday a cane! \n\n\nThis experience has completely changed how I see physical therapy. The compassion, advocacy, and belief that PTs have in their patients’ potential truly changes lives. Seeing how much of a difference it’s made for my dad has even made me consider a career change into this field, to help others the way these incredible professionals helped him.\n\n\nSo this is really just a thank you to all the PTs, PTAs, and OTs,  who look at the whole picture, who believe in recovery even when the odds seem stacked against someone. You don’t just help people heal, you give them hope and quality of life back.\n\n\n\n\n",

    "title": "Physician Perspective - DPT Didn't Go Far Enough",
    "text": "Hi all, interested in your thoughts on this.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems like the pre DPT program was either a tough Masters or a short doctorate. PT leadership then made a small extension to call it a doctoral program, but, in doing so increased student loans without any commensurate increase in privileges or scope of practice. From the physician perspective, it seems one could debate if it was a 'cart before the horse' attempt to facilitate lobbying for those vs arguing it's a better representation of the rigor of the program, similar to a JD. Other countries, however, continue to have safe, effective, and (by all appearances) equivalent care given by Bachelors or Masters trained PTs, while in the US PTs now have more student debt and criminally low reimbursement rates (in many cases).\n\nHave PTs ever discussed basically extending the DPT further while also keeping a Masters PT.  \n\\- MPT: prior program - 2 or 2.5 years to become a Physical Therapist  \n\\- DPT: a 4 year + 2 year post graduate training period with a deeper dive into physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, imaging, sports medicine and rehab medicine alongside clinical clerkships and post-graduate work analogous to physician residency, where afterward PTs would work in a role similar to a Sports Medicine Physician or Physiatrist depending on their clinical track, with more privileges (imaging, prescription, etc). More in keeping with what optometrists have done relative to ophthalmology (eye doctor vs eye surgeon; it would be PT MSK doctor vs MSK surgeon). With that, they would have a higher salary (eg +$150k).\n\nClearly as a physician one wouldn't think me to be arguing for non-physician scope expansion, but if I try to be objective from the outside looking in I thought of that approach and it made sense to me, so I was curious on PTs thoughts. As it stands it seems like the DPT approach neither improves upon prior PT outcomes (correct me if I'm wrong) nor has it supported scope expansion or better reimbursement.",

    "text": "I just finished a bachelors in Health Science with a concentration in Allied Health and got accepted to UConn DPT. Is it backwards and stupid to pick a 2 year X-Ray program and eventually train into MRI over Physical Therapy?\nReasons I did this:\n1. COST \nPT program I got accepted to in Connecticut starts at 100k in tuition alone and that’s not even considering the cost of living loans I need to take out if I am not able to work.\nThe X ray program is less than 30k altogether and I think I would be able to work a lot more considering I have 24 of the required 77 program credits to graduate. \n2. PAY (As of May 2023 in Connecticut)\nAccording to the BLS: DPT make between 75k and 130k.\nX-ray techs make between 57k and 110k\nMRI techs make between 74k and 119k\nIt’s really disappointing to see that a doctorate degree in healthcare caps at 130k \n3. Current Living Situation\nI currently live with my fiancé and obviously have bills we need to pay. Most PT students I know either take out loans, have rich parents, or are single. \n\nUPDATE \nI ended going the X ray route. I have also learned that I can teach in a radiography program after 2 years of clinical experience. It makes me feel a little better about getting my bachelors out of my way. ",

Sure, they may offer additional financial aid and scholarships but that's being pretty hopeful. I see application rates dropping due to financial concerns, and due to that, acceptance standards dropping as well just to keep programs alive. \n\nOn another front, we have the ever-present battle for fair reimbursement from Medicare and commercial providers, which we all know has been plummeting for years and shows little sign of getting any better. With the reclassification, insurance companies can very easily look at us and say that if we're not professionals, then why reimburse as if we are? Reimbursement rates plummet, which worsens the cascade of lower salaries and increased caseload just for companies to stay afloat.\n\nAll of this to say, I think we're headed for really tough times ahead.

    "text": "I’m a DPT who left the field and went into another very lucrative field. That being said, I’ve been doing this job 3.5 years and feel like I’m crawling out of my skin. I feel like I’ve got golden handcuffs. I drive at minimum 3-4 hours a day, at minimum. I am up and on the road at 515 am every single day, and I’m so sick of feeling like I have zero life outside of work. Prior to this, I tried everything in PT from a setting perspective. I even owned my own business and thrived at it. It was my absolute dream and for reasons outside of my control due to COVID, I had to shut it down. \n\nI really grew to love owning my own business when I did, but I had someone that did the bookkeeping/billing/insurance side of it and felt totally micromanaged ALL the time. I’m talking calls at 10:30 at night. Emails or texts at 2:30 in the morning. You name it. I’m not sure why this person was like this, but I really felt it ruined the entire experience for me of being a business owner. After this, I left the field and didn’t come back. \n\nI’m trying to sort out why I’m feeling this pull back to PT, why I’m wanting to get out of this career I’ve been in for the past 3.5 years and have excelled very well at, and it seems to come down to a number of factors. \n\n1. Freedom of time. I really miss my mornings OR being home at a decent time at night. I work 10-12 hour shifts at minimum 3-4 days a week. When I owned my own PT business, I worked a ton but loved it because it was my own business. \n\n2. Micromanagement. I seem to really hate being micromanaged. I also just quite honestly hate working for other people. I’ve never been great at taking direction and smell narcissistic, toxic behavior from a mile away and have found that a lot of very, very successful business people have narcissistic tendencies and are also very micromanagey. \n\n3. Complete Ownership/Entrepreneurship. Although I owned my business, I didn’t really have anything to do with the billing process or anything along those lines. I don’t think I got to truthfully run my business the way I personally would have run it, and felt things were cut short business wise because of COVID, living in a VHCOL area and suffering financially after trying to make the business work for so long once things shut down.\n\n4. Quality of life. I can’t remember the last time I worked out twice or three times in a week, meal prepped, or felt great about myself from a mental or physical standpoint. I have gained 20 pounds and feel like a total SLUG. I’m not obese by any means, but I’m afraid if I keep down this road, I’ll continue to self sabotage. I’m also never, ever home during the day and don’t have a way to heat up lunch or meal prep because of the nature of the job I’m in. \n\nAnyways, I guess I’m coming here to say, the grass isn’t always greener on the other side, even if you’re making 2-3x what you were as a PT. I’ve still got my license and keep up on it, and I’m seriously considering getting back into it as my own business owner, building this out on the side until I get to a point where I can go full time with it. If anyone has any words of encouragement or thoughts, I’d love to hear them. Thanks for coming to my TED talk. Also, sorry for not sharing the field of work I’m in, I’d like to stay as anonymous as possible, respectfully. ",

I used to be a tech and now that I’m a DPT I’m scratching my head at why I was allowed to do stuff without a license lol.  Obviously no shade to techs ofc you’re just trying to earn a living and get experience! Just interested in what people think 👀\n\nI wonder if this will end up on that IG page for discussion too lol",

    "text": "Hello, i'm in undergrad and deciding if I want to pursue either PT or PTA school.  I'm leaning towards PT but i'm turned off by the debt and income ratio.  not as worried about the income but the debt seems to be absurd. can a DPT please tell me what it's actually like living/surviving/budgeting with being around $90-200k in debt. like are you constantly financially stressed, or do you find it manageable? have you ever needed to put other life paths on hold for years in order to pay off debt (like buying home, building family, weddings, or other big life purchases or events). i seem to be drawn to PT as a career but i told myself i will never put myself into a lot of debt since ive grown up seeing my parents &amp; siblings struggle financially due to their debt. so it's a big thing for me not wanting the stress and anxiety of being in that much debt.

    "title": "Oregon PTs/PTAs - help needed!",
    "text": "I hope this is okay to post here!\n\nThere’s a bill in the Oregon Senate right now that would expand our practice act for the first time in 20 years. It includes:\n-protecting our DPT designation so that only doctors of physical therapy can use it (and not “dynamic personal trainers”)\n-allows us to order DME\n-allows us to sign off on disabled parking permits\n-finally includes dry needling into our practice act\n-allows PTs to use sonography for PT purposes without having to get an additional license\n\nThese provisions would bring the scope or PT/PTA in Oregon into this era and improve access to care for lots of Oregonians. Unsurprisingly, the acupuncturists have gotten wind and flooded the zone with opposition letters, calling us “unskilled”, “unqualified” and “a danger to patient safety” should we finally be allowed to offer a treatment modality that’s currently offered (safely) in 46 other states. Read the text of the bill here. \n\nSo we need people (PT’s, PTA’s, even patients) to submit supportive written testimony for the hearing that takes place Tuesday May 6th. It’s super easy; you can find the link to submit in the overview of the bill that I posted above. If you’d like already written templates for PT’s and PTA’s as well as patients, DM me and I can share a Google Drive link with resources. \n\nThank you!\n",

I remember the “DPT” lifetime stuff a while ago and hadn’t thought of it until this video. \n\nThe fact it’s an ad and they are blatantly acting like PTs while not being PTs (they turned their comments off as well).\n\nI like this profession, I respect anyone who going through school and grinds through the career to help people. What can I/we do to finally put a stop to the Dynamic Personal Trainer nonsense and help give this profession the respect it deserves? \n\n",

Seems like a good place to start is 96k starting salary with incentives like 5k bonus if maintain full caseload by end of year. Plus offering 3-5% growth each year in addition to bonuses and benefits. \n\nAssuming full caseload is 30 sessions (hour long) per week with 1-on-1 care, does this sound pretty fair to you?",

    "title": "Is post-surgical scar massage for adhesion management evidence-based?",
    "text": "TL;DR, my question: see post title.\n\nContext for question: I'm a patient recovering from an abdominal surgery similar to a c-section. I am doing post-operative PT under the care of a DPT professional who I trust, focused about 90% on rebuilding core strength and function and 10% on scar tissue manual mobilization and nerve desensitization. To be clear: I am NOT seeking medical advice. Rather, I am trying to understand the PT field's **professional consensus around scar tissue massage / mobilization for post-surgical adhesion outcomes.**\n\nAdditional background is that I mentioned to a close friend of mine who is a pediatric surgeon at a top US-based university hospital that I was doing scar massage as a part of my rehab for my surgical incision. I inquired if she had done it for hers, as she'd herself personally had two c-section births in the past two years. She had NO idea what I was talking about, and she routinely performs abdominal surgery on children ... and has the same abdominal incision herself. She had never even heard of scar massage. I'm wondering if this is a case of \"surgeons not knowing anything about rehabilitation\" (obviously quite common) or if scar massage / mobilization is just voodoo magic that feels nice but doesn't do much. Or something in between. My surgeon friend's total lack of knowledge here made me wonder about how evidence-based this scar massage practice might be.\n\nI'm a scientist, but in another field completely, and I know that I don't have the knowledge to determine which research journals are considered high quality in the domain of physical therapy and rehabilitation when conducting a literature review. I thought the community here might have some insight and perhaps high quality citations, or understanding if there's a gap here. Thanks. I think this doesn't break the community rules as I am not asking for medical advice and am already working with a professional PT.\n\nEDIT: I found three studies in the *Journal of Women's and Pelvic Health Physical Therapy,* all of which are great and relevant. This was after DPT-flaired user \"Nature\\_and\\_Nurture\" suggested this was a best-in-class journal for research in this domain. None were mentioned by the AI \"Open Evidence\" system.

    "title": "Working as a tech makes me second guess going into pt",
    "text": "As the title suggests I am currently a tech and after working in clinic I am not sure pt is for me. Physical therapy was not my first choice of profession but I thought it would be a good fit, because I was originally studied athletic training. I have loved working with patients and seeing improvement between all the clients I've worked with in the past 6 months.\n\nHowever I’ve felt so much stress from the physical therapists. I am directly under my clinical director and mainly told to listen to him for my day to day tasks. Numerous times he has me treating all 3 of his patients some hours so he can get caught up on notes. This is on top of cleaning up around the clinic, doing laundry, and even handling front desk activities. This has caused other clinicians to critique me and tell me I am not doing enough for them. I am constantly cleaning up after people but they are so focused on finishing their notes to notice anything I do for them. (I don’t want recognition i just want them to get off my back for “not helping them enough”.) I feel like I am spread so thin here without any respect from my colleagues. All the people working here seem so stressed and overworked. My boss wants me to move to full time because we treat anywhere from 12-18 patients an hour and I am the only tech in the region. I am so underpaid and I wanted a raise and they told me they only offer 3% raises (an extra .30/hour.) I hear pts talking about being underpaid and for the stress they feel I understand the burn out.\n\nI decided to skip dpt apps this year because I am so conflicted. I am know debating pta school, but I am wondering if pta is any less stressful. I want to work in rehab and help people in such a physical way but I am scared to death I will be miserable and in so much debt if I choose this route. Did anyone else feel this way before choosing to continue their education? Do I try to explore other routes or just jump in to schooling because I love the actual patient care part of the job?",
