I've been in the emergency department dealing with all sorts of patients (had a lady with a hemorrhaging trach, Kids with croup/asthma, CHF patients struggling with desaturating, COPD exacerbations, among others).

    "text": "Five years as a RT and it finally happened. Wondered when this day would come.\n\nLeaving the grocery store and some guy is ODing on the goddam sidewalk - well actually half way in the bushes. I see someone doing really shitty compressions and overhear he’s had four doses of narcan!? Bystander on phone with 911. Dude looked dead. Friends saying “he’s gone”. \n\nNot so fast. We pull him out of the bush and onto the sidewalk. I tapped friend doing the shitty compressions out and started at it. His friend said he felt a pulse. I felt nothing so kept going. I’ve been in the NICU for a while and forgot how hard an adult chest is! Like holy sh*t. Didn’t help that I literally just came from the gym and my arms were shakey AF. Dude, got another dose of narcan and homey came back. \n\nMan, that sucked. His girlfriend’s big sad blue eyes are burned into my mind. She looked so scared and heartbroken. She seemed so young:( \n\nStanding there, watching the dude’s buddies getting him in chair and dumping water on his head making him mad (kinda comedic). I hear the one bystander ask the other “have you seen anything like this before”. “No”, she says. They’re both visibly shaken and, I’ll admit, so was I. It’s a whole different ballgame when you’re out in the wild and you have nobody else there who knows the things too. \n\nCop shows up and is talking to the bystanders, assessing the situation. I straight dip out. Like Irish Goodbyed it. It was like my RT mode activated. I did the things and like a phantom, straight ghosted the situation. \n\nHere’s the hindsight: He prob OD’d on fent. I didn’t ask. Just assumed. And now I’m asking myself did I put myself in danger? What if I inadvertently got it in my system. Like what are you supposed to do?! He looked dead when I got there. Like blue/purple and empty eyes, mouth agape. I have no idea how long he had been like that. \n\nUgh, I hope I never have to do that again. It’s just so frickin sad.\n\nWould love to hear your CPR in the wild stories too. ",

    "title": "Greetings from your new mod!",
    "text": "To my fellow snot suckers, neb jockeys, and aggressive weaners:\n\nTo my great surprised, yesterday I received a notification inviting me to join the mod team here. I've been an active member here for several years, so it's wonderful to join the mod team.\n\nA little about me: I've been an RT for 10 years (plus 1 where I worked as a student); I got my bachelor's right out of college, did nothing with that for several years, and then stumbled into RT in my late 20s. I've been a traveler for 4 years, and I've worked in 6 different states (7 if you count my 3 weeks in Texas during COVID). I obtained my ACCS in 2019, and earned a master's in respiratory care in 2023. While there are certainly aspects I don't like I'm a huge RT cheerleader and have taught RT students, RN students, med students, pharm students, medical residents, and given in-services to PT, OT, and SLP.\n\nIn 2020 I started PA school, with the hope that I could work pulm/critical care. Albuterol for CHF? Not on my watch! Sadly, PA school was like nothing I'd ever experienced before (or since) and I failed out 80% through didactic. Shortly thereafter, I was invited to help moderate r/prephysicianassistant, where I still help advise how to get into PA school. \n\nI mention that only to say that I'm not some basement dweller out for power like cliché Reddit mods. I'm one of you, and I want everyone to have a good time here, exchange information, and collaborate. While I haven't discussed this with the mod team, my hopes for this sub are: \n\n1) A wiki-style information page covering frequently asked questions (like how to pass the TMC/CSE/whatever the future exam is called). Along with that, posts that ask questions that can be found in the wiki would be directed to the wiki and deleted. \n\n2) Similarly, I want better visibility of the thread with pay info. Posts that ask about pay would be directed to the thread and deleted. \n\n3) The automod. There have been attempts to have the automod do some work. That's fine, but that hasn't always gone well. Posts/comments with any sort of curse word were summarily deleted, and right now any comment deemed a run-on sentence gets flagged and held. \n\n4) In general, I view my role as a moderator as just that, a *moderator*. I wish to moderate content. I'm a referee, deciding if someone is being too rude, or if a patient question crosses the line. That also means I want your input. Is there something you want to see in this sub? Is there something that isn't working? Then I want to hear from you. \n\nKeep in mind that none of my proposed changes are happening any time soon. Between work and life, writing/editing a wiki for this sub can take some time, plus I want feedback from the rest of the mod team. I only want to introduce myself and share with you my hopes for this sub. \n\nThanks! ",

    "title": "Where are we going with Respiratory?",
    "text": "I believe a major issue facing the respiratory therapy field today is a lack of direction from our leadership. Ten years ago, we had the AARC’s 2015 and Beyond goals, which laid out clear guidelines for advancing the profession. These goals included:\n\n-Establishing advanced credentials, such as the RRT as the standard and promoting the ACCS specialization.\n\n-Recommending the bachelor’s degree as the entry-level standard for new therapists.\n\n-Developing and implementing the Advanced Practice Respiratory Therapist (APRT) role.\n\n-Positioning RTs as clinical leaders rather than task-based staff.\n\nNow, a decade later, few of these goals have been realized. The APRT program is struggling to gain traction and remains stuck in political and institutional gridlock. The push for a BS degree as the entry-level standard has largely been abandoned. Advanced credentials like ACCS have not become widespread or incentivized.\n\nWe are experiencing a crisis of leadership and vision in our professional organizations. This is not a “future” problem — it is a current emergency. Any roadmap for the profession must begin by addressing our most urgent and immediate need: stabilizing the RT workforce and improving recruitment and retention.\n\nWe currently face several critical challenges:\n\n-Severe staffing shortages across hospitals and long-term care facilities. Many RTs are leaving for nursing, travel positions, or leaving healthcare entirely.\n\n-High burnout, increased turnover, and early career exits.\n\n-RT education programs are struggling to recruit students, and enrollment is declining.\n\n-Wage stagnation continues, despite increasing workloads.\n\n-RTs are being asked to do more with fewer resources, which puts patient safety at risk.\n\nTo begin addressing these issues, the top priority must be workforce stabilization. We need to focus on attracting and retaining new RTs while keeping experienced therapists in the field.\n\nIn the short term, we may need to accept that a step backward is necessary before we can move forward. Hospitals with unrealistic floor workloads may need to shift some routine tasks, such as MDIs or simple nebulizers, to nursing staff. RTs should be concentrated in areas where they provide the most clinical value, such as the ICU, ER, step-down units, tracheostomy care, chest physiotherapy, and airway management.\n\nSmaller community hospitals may face the greatest difficulty. Some may attempt to cut or eliminate RT staffing altogether, especially if they are financially strained. That would be a dangerous move, but unfortunately, it could become more common. In many of these facilities, RTs may soon be seen as a luxury rather than a necessity.\n\nWe may need to reach the bottom before the profession can rebuild. This crisis cannot be fixed overnight. However, once we stabilize the system, we can begin to rebuild the pipeline, refocus RT roles, and grow again — strategically and sustainably.\n\nLooking forward, we should consider shifting our clinical focus more permanently to areas of high value, such as ICU care, step-down management, airways, tracheostomies, and complex therapies. We may no longer have the staffing numbers to support traditional floor therapy workloads, and even travel RTs may not be able to close the gap in the future.\n\nRegarding the APRT, I may be in the minority, but I believe it is a flawed concept — not because of the role itself, but because of how it was executed. We are creating supply before there is demand. Hospitals are not asking for APRTs. Graduates are being produced with no clear hiring path and no established reimbursement structure.\n\nUntil we address the staffing crisis, pay disparities, and the profession’s visibility, the APRT feels like a misplaced effort. As it stands, we are attempting to build a second story on a house with a crumbling foundation. The average RT does not want or need a new degree right now. They want fair pay, better working conditions, and respect — and they need it now, not five years from now.\n\nA more realistic path forward could be:\n\n-Develop clinical ladders within the existing RRT framework.\n\n-Expand protocol-driven care in the ICU and step-down environments.\n\n-Prioritize compensation, retention, and recognition for bedside RTs.\n\t\n-Invest in leadership, education, and research pathways that already exist and can be expanded.\n\nMost importantly, we should explore RT-to-PA and RT-to-perfusion bridge programs. These pathways could offer more promising career advancement opportunities. RTs already have direct patient care experience and a strong foundation in cardiopulmonary physiology. Creating structured bridges to PA and perfusion programs could attract more students to RT programs and give current RTs realistic upward mobility.\n\nThere is no question that we are facing a crisis. The profession lacks leadership, direction, and a unified voice. Without decisive action, the situation will continue to deteriorate. But with honest assessment, strategic thinking, and collaboration, we can stabilize the workforce and build a more sustainable future — one that works for both patients and respiratory therapists alike.\n",

    "text": "Recalling an event that happened last month: It was my first and last time working with this RT during NOC shift at a post-acute facility (2 RTs per shift). I had previously heard from multiple nurses and other RTs that this individual had a reputation for being lazy, frequently disappearing from the facility for extended periods, and accumulating multiple prior write-ups. I witnessed his incompetence first hand during a Code Blue on that same shift.\n\nI was notified by an nurse that a trach patient (that was assigned to the other RT ) was coding. By the time I arrived, CPR had already been in progress for 10 minutes (facility doesn't have microphone announcements to announce code blues, otherwise I would've been there sooner). I saw the RT bagging the trach patient when I got there. I offered to help take over bagging/help with chest compressions and what does he do? He immediately leaves the room instead of staying to help, and goes back to the  RT department to go on his phone.\n\nThe most egregious part, however, was that I immediately noticed the reservoir bag on the BVM was not inflated. Upon inspection, I realized that the other RT didn't even turn on the flowmeter regulator on the oxygen H-tanks (my facility doesn't have flowmeters connected to the wall). In addition, the pilot balloon on the trach was completely DEFLATED, meaning the patient was not ventilated properly at all. In short, the patient was receiving (or the lack there of) ROOM AIR oxygen, NOR was the patient being ventilation properly for the first 10 minutes of CPR. EMT finally arrived and she was transported to the hospital.\n\nI have no idea how he has a license. The charge nurse and I reported the incident to the supervisor, and the last I heard, he was fired. Personally, I think he should lose his license for this level of negligence.\n\nFeel free to share your incompetent healthcare worker stories!",

    "text": "I just had such an embarrassing interaction with a doc, I need to hear yall's stories about the worst times you've put your foot in your mouth with a PT or coworker.\n\nI go down to ED to get report. Day RT is one of the best therapists in our department, so I always trust his judgement. He tells me he just started an unnecessary BiPAP at a resident's insistence. Pt comes in fluid overloaded, normal HR, 100% SpO2 on RA, slightly hypertensive and slightly tachypneic. Blood gas completely, textbook normal. Pt pulling Vt of 1600 on 10/5. Resident won't budge, she wants it on for at least an hour. Ok fine, whatever. I go see him after making my equipment rounds, he's fine. Still pulling insane volumes. I have to widen the alarms even further so the V60 stops chirping. Not even 40 min after report, I get a call. \n\n\"Hey it's Sydney (fake name), I just took room 25 off BiPAP, you can come get the machine.\"\n\n\"oh ok, I'll be right there. I don't even know why it was started, it was completely unnecessary.\"\n\n\"hmm.. OK.\" -click-\n\nthat's odd, I thought. I'm pretty tight with Sydney the charge nurse, maybe I've done something to annoy her recently. well, a bit later I end up having to start a HFNC in room 26, which is coincidentally right outside the residents station. I overhear another nurse walk up to the station and say, \"hey Sydney, room 23 is asking if they can eat, is that okay\" \"yeah that's fine\"\n\nin a panic, I check EPIC for who was putting the orders in for the BiPAP in room 25. Of course, it was a resident named Sydney.\n\nI facepalmed so fucking hard lmfao. Turns out Sydney the charge RN isn't working tonight lol\n\nTLDR: got a call from someone to pull a BiPAP. I tell her sure, the BiPAP was unnecessary and I don't know why it was started in the first place. turns out I was talking to the doc who insisted we start it.\n\nanyway let's hear yall's stories.",

    "text": "I have been an RT for over a decade. In the past I would have a few patients a year, maybe, who had never had a neb before (yay nebs for CHF wheezes) and they would comment on the taste. The patients were very few and far between.\n\nThe last 6 months or so I have had at least a couple people a week mention the terrible taste. I had a COPDer mention it as well. The person had been on duoneb for years and years. They stated they had notice a taste change in the last few months and I told her how I had experienced people saying that the taste was terrible more often. The patient was glad to hear it because they thought they were going crazy. \n\nAnother coworker who has done RT longer than me mentioned it too. \n\nAnyone else seeing this? I wonder what would have changed. \n",

    "title": "Should I feel guilty for leaving the profession?",
    "text": "I graduated from my respiratory program in April 2024, and I’ve been working as an RRT at a Level 1 trauma center for exactly a year and half.  During my program, I realized I wanted to pursue physician assistant school.  I applied this cycle, and was fortunate enough to gain an acceptance on my first try. I start my program in January and as excited as I am, I have to admit I feel a little guilty about leaving after a year and a half.  \n\nThis was my only job as an RRT, my experience has been incredible, I became cross trained in the ED, PICU/NICU, and CVICU, and despite the pay and constant staffing shortages, I actually like my coworkers and the facility.  I think clinicals opened my eyes and made me realize respiratory therapists don’t have as much mobility as nursing and I wasn’t sure if I could see myself doing the same thing for the rest of my career.  I also live in a very HCOL area and realized most of my peers have to work 60 hours a week to support themselves. My starting salary as a new grad was $25/hr and they recently bumped us up to $29/hr. My thought is I’d rather go back to school for 2 years if it means improved career satisfaction and quality of life.\n\nI’ve built good relationships with my coworkers and some lament that they always lose good therapists after a short period of time, and I think that attributes to some of my guilt.

    "title": "Is becoming an RT worth it?",
    "text": "\n*Edit* Thank you all for your advice! Please keep it coming! I would like to say that nursing isn’t a career I see myself doing. Major respect but the RN track is not for me. I’m also considering radiology/sonography but would like to go more bedside. Thanks all!\n\nI’m a 19 y/o sophomore on track to earn my bachelor’s in respiratory therapy. I’ve completed most of the prereqs but still have enough wiggle room to change my major if I really want to. Originally, I picked respiratory therapy because I enjoy clinical jobs. I’m a part-time phlebotomist and really like the atmosphere.\n\nMy original plan was to work as an RT for a few years after graduating and then apply to PA school. But now I’m having second thoughts. PA school would mean a lot of extra time and money on my part, and honestly, I’m so ready to graduate that I’m not sure I want to go back for grad school. I’d also have to take a ton of really hard classes, like organic chemistry and biochemistry, on top of my RT curriculum just to meet the PA school prerequisites.\n\nMy question for existing RTs out there is: Are you content with your job, and do you think I should still pursue higher education like PA school? I’ve heard so many conflicting opinions, I’m not sure what to believe. Some people say getting a bachelor’s is a waste of time because they do the same job as RTs with associate degrees. Others say it’s worth it because a bachelor’s is the only way to move into managerial positions.\n\nI shadowed an RT supervisor at a well-known hospital, and he genuinely seemed to love his job. Based on my experience that day, it seemed like something I’d really enjoy.\n\nI’ve also heard a lot of conflicting things about pay. I’m a Type One diabetic, so having a decent salary and great insurance is essential to me. I’ve seen RT salaries ranging from $20–$70 an hour. Making a ton of money isn’t my top priority—I don’t envision myself with kids or a big house—but I’d like to be comfortable.\n\nThanks to anyone who stuck with me through my rambling, I appreciate your insight!",

    "text": "Right now I am a second year college student working towards completion of my B.S. in biology. My parents wanted me to become a doctor, but as I battle through my prerequisite classes, I find myself dreading more debt, 6 more years of school, and even higher levels of stress IF I even make the med school cut.  \n\n\nWhile I am pretty conflicted about what I want to do after graduating, I know I don't want to spend another 4 straight years in med school and 4+ more in residency. I also do not want to be stuck working in a lab for $20 an hour as a lab tech.\n\nI find myself more and more looking into 2 year graduate programs that are in the medical field that won't cost another $50-100k. So far RT is at the top of the list, with PA lagging slightly behind (Due to costs and admission being unpredictable).\n\nStrictly in terms of passion, my brother with CF is who got me interested in the world of medicine. Treating other kids like him was one of my primary motivators for going into healthcare. Cost-wise, it seems most degrees cost 10-25k, and the median salary starts at \\~60k and levels out to 80k (at least in WA state where I want to live). Which would give me enough wiggle room to pay off my debt while living frugally. \n\nHave any RTs on this subreddit pursued their associates after completing an unrelated bachelor's degree? What can I expect when I apply to RT programs (specifically if anyone has applied to school in the WA state area)? Are there any good resources I can read as I research this career pathway? \n\n",
