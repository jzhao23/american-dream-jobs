    "title": "Update on nanny’s swimsuit",
    "text": "Yesterday I posted about issues with our nanny’s swimsuit. Didn’t expect it to spark such a debate and was surprised at many of the comments. Some were adamant it was out of line for me to say anything because of so many reasons — slut shaming/sexualizing/misogyny. Even saw some people accusing me of being jealous of her and worried about my husband seeing her which is crazy because I’m happily married to a woman! But anyway, thought I would provide a not very interesting update. Today was not a pool day, but when she arrived this morning I just pulled her aside and basically said what the top comment of my previous post suggested (Thank you!) Asked her if she’d be willing to get a more athletic suit for work because of professional and safety concerns, and offered to pay for it. She took it really well and said she understood. I offered $100 for the new suit but she laughed and was like, “are you crazy, they have full piece suits at Walmart for 20 bucks, I’ll pick one up while I’m out with the kids later” 😆 Lol. I’m so relieved!  I absolutely love our nanny — she's been with us for so long and has always been very easy-going and receptive! I’m really glad I decided to say something. Thank you to all those who left helpful comments yesterday! ",

    "title": "A lot of the issues in r/Nannyemployers are caused by the employers",
    "text": "Throwaway account bc it needs to be said, but I don't need the crazy traced back to me. \n\nTried posting in r/Nannyemployers, but they don't like differing opinions. I figured I'll bring it straight to the nannies. \n\n——\n\nI’ve had the same nanny for 5 years, and after spending way too much time lurking in the employer sub, I have to say it: a lot of you are not good employers.\n\nI know that’s harsh, but seriously, read your own posts. “Nanny ghosted after 3 weeks.” “Third nanny in 6 months.” “Nanny acted entitled.” And then you admit you’re paying $20/hr for a 45+ hour workweek, expect laundry, dishes, deep cleaning, educational activities, potty training, and “occasional evenings,” all with no contract, no PTO, no sick days, and no guaranteed hours. That’s exploitation, not employment.\n\nAnd then there’s the banked hours scam. Let’s be honest. Telling someone they have a “full-time job” and then at any given time telling them not to come to work for whatever reason, and holding the other 10 as some vague IOU, is wage theft. If you wouldn’t tolerate it from your boss, don’t inflict it on someone taking care of your kid.\n\nEven worse is the double standard in expectations. You want the nanny to treat your kids like royalty (no screens, no sugar, Montessori-style engagement 24/7), but as soon as you clock in, it’s iPads and Lunchables. You insist on positive discipline and zero raised voices. Then you scream at your spouse across the kitchen while your toddler watches. Some of you are asking your nanny to parent better than you do. It’s hypocritical and, frankly, disrespectful.\n\nPeople on this sub act like hiring a nanny is some kind of personal favor you’re doing. “She should be grateful.” “It’s an easy job.” “It’s not like she’s a teacher.” No. She’s a childcare professional. Many nannies have early childhood training, certifications, and years of experience. If you treat them like a disposable servant, don’t be surprised when they leave.\n\nIt really gets me how often employers expect blind loyalty while offering zero security. You want a nanny who will stay with your family for years. But you won’t give a raise, won’t offer health insurance, and won’t even pay legally. Then you get shocked when they move on “without notice.” Why would anyone stay long-term in a job that has no protections?\n\nHere’s the truth: good nannies are not hard to find. Good jobs are. If your last two nannies left without notice, your kid cries when they see you instead of the nanny, and your “flexible” schedule changes every week, you might be the red flag.\n\nIf this post pisses you off, maybe ask yourself why. If you’re actually offering a fair wage, W2 employment, a contract, PTO, and clear boundaries, then great. You’re not who I’m talking to. But if you’re trying to run a household like it’s a startup, squeezing max value out of underpaid labor, don’t act shocked when you keep getting turnover.\n\nChildcare is a real job. Treat it like one. Or keep posting about your “bad luck.",

    "text": "Been working for this family for about 6 months. MB is the breadwinner and DB is still in training for his job. So MB hired and pays me, and DB is the reason I’ve been working overtime every week. He’s been “working from home” but he’s actually just napping for 8/10 hours he’s at the house. He does work some though. I do not like him. He’s annoying and I genuinely don’t know why anyone would marry him, but I digress. \n\n\nSo, on Friday, I’m putting the baby down for a nap as DB is heading to the airport to go out of town for the weekend. He tells me a package is coming and asks me to put it in the garage before MB gets home. I agree. Here’s the thing, I morally disagree with hiding things from your spouse and I follow a strict girl code in the workplace. But ultimately, he is technically my boss so I do as told. The package is an expensive golf club. Oooooh boy. I’m guessing bought with MB’s money. So, I do place it in the garage. However, he seemed to forget that the baby’s stroller is in the garage. So I placed it right where she would see it if she grabbed the stroller this weekend. It brings me joy to know that he is going to get caught. He has been a pain in my ass since day 1. And honestly, I don’t have any loyalty to him. My loyalty lies with the person who signs my checks 🙏 hate a liar anyway. loser behavior. \n\n\nAnyway, end rant. ",

    "title": "I Work for a Wealthy Family, and I’m One Rule Away from Screaming Into the Void",
    "text": "\nI’ve been working for this wildly unhinged family for over a year, and at this point, I deserve a medal of honor, hazard pay, and maybe a free trip to therapy. But since I’m getting none of those, I’ve decided to bless you all with some of the batshit house rules I have to follow—plus a story from today that nearly sent me to the afterlife.\n\nRule #1: Screens? Music? JOY? Not in This Household.\n\nThis kid gets ZERO screen time. I mean NONE.\n\nNot a single TV show, not a single song, not even an instrumental background tune. If it’s not coming from a pre-approved educational toy or my own mouth, it is forbidden.\n\nI would give one of my kidneys to put on five minutes of Miss Rachel. JUST. FIVE. MINUTES.\n\nBut no. Instead, I’m in the middle of the playroom singing The Wheels on the Bus for the 734th time while staring into the distance like a soldier who’s seen too much.\n\nRule #2: Nap Time = Time to Become a Cleaning Goblin.\n\nYou think nap time means I get a break?\n\nAHAHAHAHA. NO.\n\nThe moment this child’s eyelids shut, I immediately become a full-time maid.\n\t•\tScrub the wine cellar.\n\t•\tClean the home theater.\n\t•\tWipe down every single one of the 500 barstools.\n\t•\tFold million-dollar baby clothes.\n\t•\tReevaluate my life choices.\n\nMeanwhile, I have approximately 4.2 seconds to inhale whatever fancy-ass chef-prepared lunch has been left for me before I’m summoned for my next task.\n\nRule #3: Outside? I Don’t Think So.\n\nThis kid has never experienced the warmth of the sun. If we even suggest going outside, Mom has to supervise so she can personally wrap him up like an Arctic explorer.\n\nIt could be a beautiful, breezy 75-degree day, and she’s dressing him like we’re about to hike Mount Everest in a snowstorm.\n\nIf one single ray of sunlight hits this child’s skin, she will call the CDC, NASA, and probably the Pope.\n\nRule #4: My Snacks Are Contraband.\n\nI cannot bring my own food into the house because Mom is convinced that her kid will somehow break into my bag like a rabid raccoon and feast on forbidden processed horrors.\n\nThe house is 100% organic, sugar-free, and natural. I, however, am 100% hungry and deeply mourning my Goldfish and Doritos.\n\nSo yes, I eat the private chef’s meals, which sounds bougie, but there are no snacks. No chips. No cookies. No caffeine. I am malnourished and afraid.\n\n⸻\n\nAND NOW… THE INCIDENT THAT BROKE ME.\n\nTHE JELLYBEAN APOCALYPSE OF 2025\n\nToday, the kid went to preschool (for one whole day a week, because any more than that might emotionally damage his soul or whatever). While he was there, his teacher made a fatal error.\n\nShe gave him ONE. SINGLE. JELLYBEAN.\n\nTo reward him for cleaning up his toys.\n\nBig. Mistake.\n\nWhen Mom found out, she IMMEDIATELY called the school in DEFCON 1 mode, demanding to know the exact color of this poisonous demon candy.\n\nWHY?\n\nBecause she read on Google University that one specific food dye might contain a potentially cancerous ingredient.\n\nThis woman called up a fully licensed, experienced preschool teacher and screamed at her over a SINGLE JELLYBEAN.\n\nI guarantee that teacher is now questioning every decision she’s ever made. The school has probably blacklisted this kid from ever receiving so much as a Cheerio.\n\nI wouldn’t be surprised if his picture is now taped to the break room wall with a note that says:\n“DO NOT FEED. WILL CAUSE PARENTAL MELTDOWN.”\n\n⸻\n\nAnd that, my friends, is just another day in my 100% organic, sugar-free, music-free, sun-free nightmare.",

We have previously had one issue where my children’s swim instructor reached out to me and said Nanny was not watching my 7(M) and 4(F) in the pool while 2(M) was in the middle of his private lesson. We had explained CLEARLY that if our children are in or around water, they MUST be supervised. \n\nToday, as I was in my room, Nanny texted me all the kids were upstairs, as she and the two older had just finished swimming. Out of simple curiosity, I thought I’d come up and help her set up the next activity. I found my youngest two alone in the bathtub, while Nanny was showering in the other bathroom. I don’t know how long they had been in there alone. I kept my deep anger and disbelief to myself and texted my husband to come upstairs. He sent her home because… i had no strength to talk to her myself. I feel betrayed. I genuinely don’t think I can look her in the eyes ever again. \n\nI want to reiterate, that drowning is the number 1 childhood cause of death (for children ages 1-4). Children can die in less than 1” of water. Drowning is silent. After 4 minutes underwater, brain damage is likely irreversible. 1 person in the US dies every day by drowning in a bathtub. These statistics haunt me. My little ones could have joined these statistics today. \n\nDon’t ever leave a child unattended in a bathtub. \n\nI gently request advice and support. \n\nEdit: included more info to the statistics. Thank you. \n\nEdit 2: finally got a chance to cry this out and talk to my husband. We’re paying her and firing her. Please don’t ever put children at risk like this.

    "text": "i got fired today unexpectedly, my MB asked me to sit with her at the table while DB took my nk twins 1.5yo to bed and i was cleaning up from the family's dinner. so i sit down and MB is making small talk with me and then she abruptly just says they have to let me go because they're \"unhappy\" with my job performance so i asked what was it that they didn't like and MB said they weren't \"getting enough return on investment\" by hiring me. she said that she nor db should have to make a grocery list for me (i asked for them to make a grocery list for me over the weekend so that when i return on mondays after the weekend i can get all their groceries since idk what they eat/use up while i'm not there and i also don't know what they might want to eat through the week) and that making a grocery list is a waste of their time and for what they pay me ($25/hour in a HCOL area) i should \"know\" what they want. she also cited the one time i ran out of time to make their family dinner because the twins were sick and needy so i was focussed more on them rather than cooking their chicken dinner. and then DB came down and sat at the table with a huge grin and just completely lit into me calling me \"incompetent\" and saying he was surprised that i've been a nanny for 10 years because he doesn't see how i've been able to hold down any of the jobs i've had. i was taken aback at that and kind of pushed back and said i have a degree in early childhood education and that although i may have worked for other families and we've had our differences in all my years as a nanny or even as a student doing placements i have never been called incompetent. and then DB just laughs and looks at me and says \"well, we hired you as a nanny and house manager and we only have 3 kids and you can't seem to figure out how to care for them, grocery shop, do laundry and run errands, and get dinner made so what would you call that?\" i was stunned. i've never been spoken to that way from anyone let alone an employer and i did stand up for myself a bit and clarify that when i was hired i was told i'd occasionally have to prep dinner for the family (chop veggies or marinate meat for dinner for MB, DB, and nk6) but over the time i've worked for them i've been tasked with making 3 different dinners (1 for the twins, 1 for MB and DB and another for nk6 if they don't want to eat what MB and DB eat) plus run all the errands, groceries, and household laundry before 3pm pickup of nk6 while also caring for twin toddlers. and DB just shrugged and said i was making excuses to cover my laziness and that he's been waiting for this day and if his wife wasn't such a pushover he would have fired me within my first week starting with them. and then i just looked to MB and said i'm sorry this didn't work out and i was trying really hard not to get upset because nk6 was just in the living room and they have a stupid open concept layout so nk could hear the whole conversation even though the tv was on. so then MB says she's sorry too and DB just has a shit eating grin while MB and i are trying to be professional with each other and going over the logistics of me handing over the keys and fob and stuff like that and then DB just gets up and walks away when MB thanks me for my time so then when DB is gone MB says in lieu of notice she's going to pay me 3 weeks pay as severance so i say thanks and leave. \n\ni'm so glad i'm done with that family, that DB made my life hell (i've posted about him before) and so i'm glad i don't have to be around him anymore. I'm also so relieved that i got fired because i was going to give my 2 weeks notice on Monday since i found a new family to work for and now i don't have to do that. so when i finally got out of the house i sent a text to the new family that hired me and told them i'm available to start whenever so now i'm starting that job on Monday. so i have 3 weeks of severance now and a new job to start on Monday and i feel like buying myself a new pair of shoes or a handbag or something to celebrate lol",

    "text": "Looking back, I feel guilty for how much I judged and complained about some of my nanny parents. I have found parenting to be more intense than nannying, and I didn’t fully grasp that until I experienced it myself. I thought I knew what I was getting into—I felt confident in my ability to handle schedules, feedings, and age-appropriate activities. And in many ways, those things did come naturally.\n\nBut nothing could have truly prepared me for the exhaustion of sleep deprivation or the sheer intensity of parenting 24/7 with little to no breaks. As a nanny, I could clock out at the end of the day. As a parent, there’s no off switch. The mental and emotional load is constant, and the responsibility never stops.\n\nThis experience has given me so much more empathy for my past nanny parents. I now understand their exhaustion, their tough decisions, and the moments when they just needed a break. Parenting humbles you in ways you don’t expect, and I’m realizing that even when you think you’re prepared, there are always challenges that take you by surprise. I am thinking about getting back into nannying and I hope that becoming a parent myself will help me have more empathy for what my Nps go through day to day because I can finally relate. I hope this makes me a better nanny. ",

    "text": "So, MB asked me if i could watch my regular NK’s and their friends kids while all the parents went out for dinner. I do this often so I automatically agreed. \n\nMB has mentioned to me before that the dad of the other kids annoys her because he sometimes makes immature jokes. She was mostly venting so I didn’t think much of it.\n\nLast night, there was a concert. My partner was selling tees there, so I decided to go as well. My NF and their friends also went (one of their other friends owns the venue). I seen my NF at their table so I went over to say hello. MB introduces me as their nanny and says “this is who will be watching the kids tomorrow.” The dad (the one MB was ranting about) says “oh i didn’t know she was black. you have a black nanny. NO WAY!” \n\nIn my head I was just like WTF no he didn’t. So I said “nobody told me you were balding but I don’t think that’s something that really needs to be discussed now is it 🙂?” He looked so red and flustered as I said goodnight and walked away.\n\nLater that night, MB messaged me apologizing on his behalf and she said that he “doesn’t feel comfortable having someone so hostile watching [his] kids.” Then she told me she found someone else to cover. \n\nWas my reaction wrong? Could this hurt my job? I also feel weird about my NF not sticking up for me :(\n\nUPDATE:\n\nWow, thank you for all of the support here 🙌🏾! This is amazing. \n\nDB sent me a message yesterday morning and asked if him and MB could take me to breakfast and discuss what happened. I said yes obviously cause who knows where my position stood after this. We agreed to do brunch @11.\n\nWe met out front, and already the vibes were tense. DB was clearly in his head—his daze was far off and he does this thing when he’s nervous and like ties his shoes constantly. MB was just making small talk asking how the rest of my night went. \n\nThe host called to seat us, we spent time silently glancing over the laminated menu, and when the server came back we all ordered.\n\nAfter the server left, DB starts word vomiting: “I’m sorry. Fuck, I’m so sorry this happened to you. We’re embarrassed and we didn’t know that he would ever say something like that. We only found someone else to cover because we didn’t want to have you in an uncomfortable situation especially with a racist. But that DID NOT translate in my wife’s first message to you. God, i’m so sorry. We hope that you still will work for us after this situation and it didn’t make you think of us differently. The kids need you. We need you and you are the person we want for the job. Your race never mattered to us—well obviously it matters but like not in that way i mean in the way that like you are a black woman and i’ll never understand what this world is like for you—I might’ve made that worse.” \n\nI didn’t know I needed to see a white man grovel until then. My laughter eased the tension, and MB looked at me sincerely as she said “We really are sorry. [their friend] won’t be visiting us here anymore; I’m uncomfortable having racism around my children. They leave Monday—tomorrow is covered so don’t worry about it. We will pay you and add a bonus.” \n\nI agreed to keep working for them as long as baldy apologized. They must have really pressed because by the time I made it home (I live 30 minutes away from the restaurant) another white man was groveling to me over the phone 😄.\n\n\n",

    "text": "I'm a bad nanny and I don't care.\n\nI've been lurking on the nanny subreddits ever since I started my job 2 months ago with now 10mo NK and just seeing posts from both employers and nannies about the job expectations I'm way under the bar, but I feel like some of the expectations are just over the top. At the end of the day we're all just people, like I genuinely don't understand.\n\nI want to prefix with the fact that I work for 2 WFH parents so I would hope if they had a problem with anything I do that they would say something but our arrangement seems fine. I have NK from 8:30am and I am never late but I'm also never early, sometimes I ring the doorbell at 8:30 on the dot bc you know what? I don't want to leave my cozy bed in the morning. I come in with messy hair sometimes because I didn't feel like taking a morning shower (sometimes I shower the night before and don't feel like doing it again in the morning just to fix the look of my curly hair). Who cares? The only people who are going to see me are NPs and NK and it's not like NK cares what my hair looks like. I check my phone regularly throughout the day. When NK is awake. That's right, I be on my phone and I don't care. Because I know you're not gonna sit here and tell me you don't check your phone throughout the day. It's not like I'm glued to it but if NK is munching on a toy ignoring my existence you better be damn sure I'm taking a second to text my girlfriend back. I nap with NK every day for both naps, I call that a job perk. I don't have any household responsibilities except for cleaning up NK's playroom and folding the occasional load of kid laundry so if everything is done, I'm napping. Why not? We take a walk every day from between 30 minutes to an hour and occasionally I call my girlfriend while we walk. I mean again, why not? I get to chat with my favorite person and NK seems way happier on walks when he can constantly hear my voice and I feel like an idiot talking to thin air to keep him happy. I can only go \"wow you see that bird? How are you doing? Look a car!\" So many times before I lose my mind. We only do like 1 \"activity\" a day because the set up takes longer than he'll actually play with it. So we spend most of the day in the playroom looking at colors and animals, playing catch, pretending to eat him, practicing standing, and chewing on toys. \n\nAll in all, I just wanted to vent because I seem to be so far below the standard in this sub but I genuinely don't understand why it's a problem to take advantage of the freedom my job offers. The kid is 10mo it's not going to ruin him psychologically if I answer a text while he's happy and within my reach. I love my job, and I love NK and his parents. And I feel like it's okay for me to be human as long as NK is being cared for, stimulated, entertained, and watched.",

    "text": "ETA: First off, whichever mod came thru clutch w that “support needed” flair, 🙏🏼\n\nSecondly, y’all. Thank you. It’s only been a couple of hours, but I’ve read every comment and your words have been so validating and valuable to me.\n\nI was seeking to be witnessed by people who know and understand this kind of love, and I feel seen here.\n\nI have an incredible husband who is holding space for me, and two best friends who would pick up on the second ring if I called, but while my husband can sympathize, he doesn’t speak this specific kind of grief-language. And my best friends are both first-time moms with a six month old and a two year old. I can’t just lay this at their feet without warning.\n\nWhat I needed was empathy from people who understand this specific shape of caregiving, the kind where the attachment is real and deep and stays with you even after the job ends.\n\nAlso, because I am chronically online, as well as of the era where we didn’t think twice about posting our NK’s online, (***they’ve been archived for years, don’t come for me) I fortunately still had access to all of the pictures I took of them from 2012 on and I printed out every single one of them, and put them in an envelope with a handwritten copy of a poem that I will share below, which is actually making me sob even harder now because I didn’t know about their new identity and developing personhood when I chose the poem, and that, as well as some other things that were referenced concerning their various names/nicknames during the eulogy, has really brought this full circle for me.\n\nForever thankful to this community. ♥️\n\n\nEach of Us Has a Name\nby Zelda Schneerson Mishkovsky\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by God\nand given by our parents.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by our stature and our smile\nand given by our clothing.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by the mountains\nand given by our walls.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by the stars\nand given by our neighbors.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by our sins\nand given by our longing.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by our enemies\nand given by our love.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by our celebrations\nand given by our work.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by the seasons\nand given by our blindness.\n\nEach of us has a name\ngiven by the sea\nand given by our death\n\n——————————————————————————\n\n\ntbh none of those flairs feel appropriate, maybe we need a “moral support” option idk\n\n\nSo yeah. I was with this fam in some capacity between the years 2012-2015, two kids, awesome parents, we had a stellar employer/employee relationship but I also just genuinely liked them as people. When the kids were old enough for full-time school I was still their standing Saturday-date-night sitter until we gradually fell out of touch. At the beginning of last years school year, my current eldest NK started kindergarten at the school former MB works at, and it was a very joyous, exciting reunion. I made sure to take NK by her office to introduce them to each other, and since then I’ve seen her no less than 3x a week at pickup. \n\nThis is a private school, and I get auto-forwarded all emails and on Tuesday I received one with info and details for the service, links to the memorial page, etc. It was a shock, of course. \n\nI attended the service this morning. And it was awful. Gut wrenching. Like, there’s no other way to describe it. It didn’t matter that I hadn’t actually seen the kids in 10+ years. No one should have to attend a 16 year olds funeral. \n\nI won’t go into detail out of respect for the family, but their death wasn’t an accident. And that part…. These parents loved and accepted their child so wholeheartedly for who they were, and I learned today that who they were went by a different name and identity than who I knew them as as a child, but they were still that same kind, bright, voracious, empathetic soul that I knew and loved and cared for all those years ago.\n\n\nBut still, they were consumed by the darkness. And now they’re gone. \n\nAnd I find myself struggling with who to turn to, who to share this grief with, because of course there are people in my life today who knew me when I was their nanny, who heard the stories of their antics, who saw the photos and watched the videos I used to take of our adventures together. But how is anyone besides a fellow nanny going to understand how this pain feels? It’s not the pain of parents, not by a longshot, not even close. But it’s not the pain of say, a former teacher, of an acquaintance. This unique relationship that we form one-on-one with these children, the trust that they place in us, the love that we give them as we care for them in those early years, and the love that we receive from them in return creates such a special bond that has become that much more sacred to me today, it has deepened today in a way that I didn’t know was possible.\n\nI’m suddenly strikingly aware of the weight of not just my influence upon these children, but of their influence upon me. \n\nTonight, I made my current NK’s Nutella pancakes with whipped cream and sprinkles for dinner. I’m normally a protein-fruit-veggie set up kind of nanny, I’m stricter about sweets than their own parents. But tonight, I just wanted to create a happy memory, I just wanted us to be able to live joyfully in that moment. \n\nI just want T.R.L to know that I will never forget them, and how thankful I am for those blissfully silly days we spent together. \n\nMay their memory be a blessing.\nMay that blessing be light.\n\n",

I continued working and just wore a mask and tried to grin and bare in, even though I am immunocompromised and get sick pretty easily. I know working with sick kids comes with the territory. They live in a smallish 2 bedroom apartment so when NPs are home from work due to illness or some other reason, we’re basically on top of each other. \n\nThat week was honestly hell. My mental health was really taking a toll. Caring for sad/sick baby, having to listen to DB cough and sneeze (unmasked) while watching loud movies on the couch, not 10 feet from the kitchen where I have to feed NK, instead of having the courtesy to stay isolated in his bedroom. And I also had family assistant duties, including cooking dinner for them every night and keeping the house organized and tidy, so I was cleaning up extra clutter and dishes and dirty tissues left on tables. I spent a couple nap times crying in the bathroom. But I didn’t complain, because I never do, because for whatever reason I tend to kiss ass when I’m nannying because I want to keep the job and I want them to… like me? Idk, I just have a really hard time sticking up for myself or setting boundaries when I’m feeling overworked. \n\nThe following week, I come down with the flu, and I stayed home W, Th, F. They didn’t apologize for getting me sick (usually NFs will at least say sorry as a courtesy??) and just said ‘oh no feel better’.\n\nSo flash forward to yesterday, Monday, I let them know that I’m feeling well enough to work again. I get there and they tell me NK2.5 has a high fever and threw up Sunday night and Monday morning, so she’s staying home from preschool and MB will be home all day too. I immediately start panicking internally, thinking, oh wonderful, im gonna get some type of stomach bug now before I’m even able to fully recover from the flu. And I’m also pissed because I have it in my contract that if the kids are vomiting, having diarrhea, or high fever, I don’t work. \n\nSo about 20 minutes into my shift I get up the courage to talk to MB about the situation. I calmly let her know that I’m really worried about getting another illness and I really wish someone would’ve let me know about NK vomiting before I showed up, and sited my contract. I asked if I could perhaps stay for half of my shift, focusing on household duties, and then leave early to have minimal contact with the kids. \n\nAs SOON as I started to express frustration, MB’s entire demeanor shifted from her typical happy/bubbly to angry/panicky/weepy. She said that NK only through up “a very small amount” and “it was probably just because she was carsick and then because she was coughing so much”. Like, girlie, come on. Kids don’t have a high fever and barf multiple times unless they are ill. She said that they’ve been so sad without me and that they’re sorry IF they got me sick, but they don’t know what they’re supposed to do for backup care (even though they have a set of grandparents that live in the same apartment building and they watch the kids all the time. When I started this job the grandma even said to me “you don’t have to worry about staying home when you’re sick because you have us to help pick up the slack!”). MB seemed offended that I brought up my contract and said that maybe we needed a new contract or a “NEW NANNY”! \n\nSo at this point I’m kind of in shock that she basically just threatened to fire me. This was literally our first confrontation ever, all communication up until this point was pleasant and kind, even if just surface level. I guess treating me with respect and kindness only went so far, and once I caused any inconvenience for them that just went out the window. She also said that they’ve been giving my unlimited sick days, as if that was proof that they treat me so well and I should not enforce my rules that I have in place to protect myself. Btw, the unlimited sick days thing was never discussed. In my contract I get 1 sick day every 3 months, and in my 5 months with them I called out maybe 4 times, and they just let the automatic full weeks pay go through on Homepay without saying anything to me. They are very very wealthy, like, DB is a founder of a very successful tech company, so I figured they were just being kind and wouldn’t miss the money. But I guess resentment was building. \n\nBut I am SO proud of myself for how to handled the situation. I knew that my boundaries had been crossed and that this job was no longer worth putting up with this. So I told her that “my number one priority is MY well-being, and MY health, not YOUR feelings.” I said “I know it’s hard, and I want to work with you to make this situation work for everyone, but as a parent it is your responsibility to find backup care when your nanny is sick or needs to stay away from your very sick children.” She couldn’t really argue with that, so she just said “fine, what do you wanna do then?! I guess you can just leave and we’ll pay you for the hours you were here today but the rest will be on YOUR dime.” \n\nShe was crying, I was shaking and could feel my heart beating out of my chest, so I told her I was going to step away for a few minutes so we both could calm down. I took the baby out in the stroller and called my partner to figure out what to do, and we decided that it was time for me to quit. I figured it was a very real possibility that they were already looking to replace me and it was only a matter of time before I got fired. I also just didn’t see a way forward after this argument, I knew I would be so anxious to come into work everyday that it would make me feel ill.\n\nWhen I went back in MB had closed herself and NK2.5 in the bedroom, so I gathered all of my things and put my bag by the front door. I said a tearful goodbye to sweet little NK9mo, and knocked on the bedroom door. I handed MB the baby and said “I’m so sorry, but this isn’t working out. I can’t work somewhere that my health and well-being is sacrificed, and where I’m given a hard time for trying to advocate for myself. This is the last time you’ll see me. I wish you guys the best of luck.” MB looked like she was about to burst into tears and just said “okay”. And then I walked out the front door and didn’t look back. \n\nI think there’s a few things to learn from this.\n1. Communicate EARLY, BEFORE resentment builds. Maybe we could’ve salvaged this if they hadn’t been begrudgingly paying me for unlimited sick days, or if I had spoken up about setting some in house boundaries when parents are home sick. Not that those are the only reasons I quit, but the little things really fester if you don’t talk about them. I do think the responsibility of communicating is on all parties, but I think it’s a little more on the NPs side because they’re the bosses. I don’t think enough NPs realize that they are signing on to be a BOSS in a WORKPLACE and they need to act professionally. \n2. When possible, put yourself first. Nannies are in a tough spot where we are at the bottom of a power dynamic with our NPs and the only advocate we have is ourselves. And self advocating is a skill that needs to be practiced. My human needs come before my nanny responsibilities. I live by that now, but when I started nannying I didn’t realize how important that was. Boundaries boundaries boundaries!\n3. It’s just a job. There’s so many emotions mixed in because our work can be very intimate by nature, but we cannot be expected to just serve our NFs unconditionally. Just like any corporate environment, if my working conditions are emotionally volatile and my bosses treat my health with little regard, that’s not okay and I’m gonna leave! \n4. If NPs are literally falling apart when their nanny is out sick, that is too much pressure on the nanny and they need to reevaluate some things. \n\nThanks for reading if you somehow managed to get through all that 😂❤️ I have this page to thank for teaching me a lot of valuable lessons that helped me navigate this situation. Now I’m gonna give myself some time to binge watch my favorite shows and snuggle my cats.\n\n",

    "title": "NM sent a text about me to me on accident",
    "text": "Meant MB in title* Needing advice and to rant. She sent this this morning: “Well, I guess let me clarify it. She has to go. I'm not gonna write out step-by-step. How to make fucking dinner or write out a list of things like put the vacuum away or clean a handprint off the fucking bathroom mirror so we need to find childcare for ___ and ___ for three days a week because Julie doesn't have any availability and she probably won't for like two years and when I mentioned something to your mom yesterday, she didn't say a single thing about Watching them even for one day so l'm not gonna ask her to watch them.” The “she” is me. Julie is the daycare provider. I watch two kids during the day (1.5 and 3) and two more after school (5 and 9) for $18 an hour. Also, the vacuum was out when I got there, I didn’t take it out, I didn’t know if it was there for a reason or not so I just left it, since I didn’t get it out I didn’t even think twice about putting it away. In our contract it said I would be responsible for dishes and tasks that she listed out but now she is saying she doesn’t have the time to make a list and that I should just clean the messes I didn’t make or didn’t happen while I was there (I’m focused on the be kids and not the things that need to be cleaned). I’ve been doing their dishes from the night before (adults and kids), all of their laundry, and sweeping and mopping occasionally. The kids are really picky and when I try to make them dinner, they say they want mom and dads cooking or they want something else and they won’t eat what I make them. That’s why I wanted a list of dinners they like and how to make them the way they like (so they will eat it). I’m at a loss as this was really hurtful to hear since she hasn’t communicated these things to me before. I feel like I’m going slightly above what we agreed upon and she’s thinking I’m doing less than what she’s paying for. She felt really bad after she sent it and realized her mistake, but it’s hard to look past. Any advice on what to do? We talked it out a bit but I’m feeling like this might be the end for me as it seems like she’s wanting more help cleaning and I’m more focused on just watching the kids and cleaning the messes we make. \n\n*UPDATE*: I sent a text saying I’d help until she found a replacement, she said that it was a blessing in disguise that it was sent bc she wouldn’t have been able to tell me how she felt otherwise. She said she’d understand if I wanted to be done but also said she’d be willing to work something out if I wanted that also. I sent this in response: “I think we should talk specifics out in person, but I’m thinking it would be best for both of us if I transitioned out of this role. I don’t feel like I can adequately or confidently provide the help you’re looking for. In my previous roles, I was mostly responsible for cleaning the dishes we used and picking up the messes we made throughout the day. I was mostly sticking to the contract we came up with. I feel awful about this because I know how much you have on your plate, but I also want to be honest about where I’m at. I completely understand that your message was in the heat of the moment, and I know you’ve been under a lot of stress. That said, I worry that I’ll feel like I’m walking on eggshells or needing to go beyond my role in order to be useful. I don’t want either of us to feel like we’re settling, snd I think someone else might be a better fit for what you’re looking for.” We talked this morning and she said she will probably just take off work for three days a week rather than finding a replacement because they will need to find someone for all four the entire day in the summer. So she left it up to me if I wanted to work for two weeks if I needed the money or if I wanted today to be my last day. I plan on texting her that today will be my last day. DB and MB own an insurance business so she has a flexible work schedule. ",

    "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nFirst of all I want to say thank you to all of other nannies here for their advice on what to do in this situation. If it wasn’t for you guys, I wouldn’t have the proof that I have now. My original post was so long ago and I apologize for the late update. I’m just now getting to the point where I can talk about what happened without getting extremely upset. I also had some failed attempts when trying to catch MB in the act (I bought a spy pen to put inside my purse but it didn’t work so I ended up getting a Ring camera). I caught MB opening and going through my purse clear as freaking day!!! And the time stamp shows that she did it while I was on a walk with NK, just like I suspected. Once I found out, I told her I wanted to speak with her that night after NK went to bed for two reasons: 1) I knew I was going to get loud and angry and I didn’t want NK to see that and 2) I knew that after this conversation, I wasn’t setting foot in that house again. Went I confronted her, she denied it until I told her that the Ring camera she found in there was actually recording her. I showed her the footage too. All I remember is that she turned bright red. Everything she said after that point was a blur because I was already planning on quitting once I saw that footage. This MB has been horrible as an employer but very passive aggressive about it, and this was the last straw!! I can’t even put into words how disrespected I feel!! ",

Well I have similar relationships with my new NPs. \n\n\nMy boyfriend came to my place of work (someone’s house) to talk to my MB about his career. She is in a similar field and offered to have a meeting with him to answer any questions he may have and give him some advice. While he was there I was playing in the living room with my NK. (We were playing with remote control cars. I had a police car and kept chasing after him) my bf saw this and jokingly said to my MB “you pay her for this?” Regardless that she knew he was joking she very seriously told him “she has the most important job of anyone I pay. She keeps him happy, occupied, and out of my hair while I work. Her job is important.” I love that woman. (She also keeps Dr Pepper stocked in the fridge for me so shouts out) \n\nEdit* Just to clear the air. My partner is a walking green flag through and through. He knows my job is not always having fun and messing around. He has, on multiple occasions, told me that he could never do what I do. His comment was a joke. Nothing more, .

    "title": "Weirdest thing NF has ever accused you of?",
    "text": "It’s been a long time since I was a nanny but I’ll never forget the nanny family that made me quit after 10 years of doing it professionally. This story isn’t the straw that broke the camels back but it definitely made me finally start to consider a career change. \n\nI had a MB accuse me of stealing her husband’s sunglasses…but not outright. The conversation went like this: \n\n\nMe: *walks into work with sunglasses on my head like I do every morning*\n\n\nMB: *stares angrily at said sunglasses* Nice sunglasses! \n\n\nMe: Thanks! They’re my favorite *confused at the angry stare* \n\n\nMB: My husband lost a pair exactly like that a few weeks ago \n\n\nMe: Oh? Around the house? I can help look for them! \n\n\nMB: We’re not sure. But they look exactly like the ones on your head. \n\n\n\nMe: *pulls them off head to show her the major scratches on the lenses from 4 years of constant use* Exactly like these? Are they beat up like mine?\n\n\n\nMB: They weren’t when he lost them…. *still staring at me angrily* \n\n\n\nMe: Oh…ok. Well I’ll keep an eye out!! \n\n\nMB: I’ll tell DB you have a pair of sunglasses exactly like his. How bizarre! When did you say you got them again? \n\n\nMe: I didn’t. But about 4 years ago, I wear them daily. They’re great sunglasses I’m sure DB is definitely missing his! \n\n\nMB: He may just steal them back! \n\n\n\nMe: ummmm what? *laughs nervously* he doesn’t want these beat up old things! \n\n\nMB: *Scoffs and storms off* \n\n\nUMMMMM. The audacity!? They were an old wire style of Rayban sunglasses. The family was very well off so I’m sure DB had a newer, nicer version. Mine were seriously beat to hell, a friend ran over them with their truck and I had to bend them back into place but I LOVED those things. Wore them every day and came in with them on my head every morning and sat them on the counter next to my coffee mug and keys every day from the very beginning. I was sooooo shocked that she accused me of stealing them but in her passive aggressive way she always communicated with me.  To this day I wonder if he ever found his sunglasses and if his wife ever felt like an ass for the way she treated me. I made sure to wear them on my head every chance I got around her just to prove I had nothing to hide. I actually quit a week later when they got crazy mad (had the grandma I never met call to berate me?) because I couldn’t accommodate a last minute schedule change. That family left such a bad taste in my mouth I never went back to nannying, just found a new career. \n\n\nAnyways… any crazy stories? \n",

    "text": "Someone talk me down here before I lose my mind because my husband is making me feel like I'm over reacting. \n\nWe have a live-in Nanny who has been with us for 2 years. I feel okay about her. The kids love her (6f and 4f - and we're about to have a baby next month). She lives in her own separate apartment above the garage but it is only accessible through the garage so it's private. We have 4 dogs - 2 big and 2 small. She doesn't take care of them at all. When we go on vacation or leave to visit family (which is about 6-8 weeks per year, spread out) she still gets regularly paid (on salary) and we hire a dog sitter to stay in our space and watch our dogs. We always got the feeling she didn't like animals. We were once stuck and asked if she could watch them for a weekend and she asked what we would pay her (on top of already getting paid) so I said nvm and figured it out. Anyway, it turns out that she got TWO small breed PUPPIES over Christmas. She didn't tell us or ask us. My husband just told me. For some background, she caused a lot of damage (5k+) to our wood floors and bathrooms in our old house just through carelessness. So I asked him the following questions:\n\n\\- When they cause damage in her attic space, who will repair it?  \n\\- \rWhere will these dogs go out to pee? Are they going to be outside our house? Coming in through our open doors into our house?\r Or is she planning on having them completely pee and poop upstairs? And then put the garbage…where?\r  \n\\- And when they have to be alone all day and aren’t potty trained, where are they peeing upstairs? On our furniture and rugs?\r  \n\\- Or is she planning on moving the kids upstairs and not doing their curriculum so that she can watch her dogs?\n\nI have received no answers but am made to feel like I am over reacting. This is really getting under my skin though. Someone talk me down. ",

    "title": "\"I'm going to tell my mom you touched my penis\"",
    "text": "Edited to add: the mom happens to be my sister in laws boss at her corporate job (didn't know until today) so I need to be careful how I handle this.\n\nI (28F) am a career nanny in between full time roles-next role starts in August. In the meantime, I've been picking up random babysitting gigs. I agreed to a three day job this week for a mom I connected with via a Facebook childcare group. I'm watching one boy, age 8. Today was the first of the three days, and it's been...not great. \n\nThe mom seems super nice, and the kid was sweet at first, but has showed some really concerning and just disrespectful behavior. The day started with him refusing to do his summer workbook page (his mom said he needed to do it before he is allowed to have any screen time). I sat down next to him to help him with it and he started crying and ran up to his room, locking the door. I went up and talked to him through the door, telling him he needed to unlock it for safety reasons. He refused. I tried to coax him out with reminders of all the fun we would get to have today but he refused. Not sure what else to do, I decided to just wait him out downstairs and figured he just needed a few mins alone to process his emotions (I was in communication with the mom letting her know the situation and making sure there was nothing dangerous in his room). Sure enough, after about ten mins he came back down and begrudgingly did the worksheet. Unfortunately, the day hasn't gotten much better from there. \n\nI have done my best to give this kid a fun summer day. We rode bikes, played some outdoor sports, I played him in video games, took him to get ice cream, and spent a good two hours at the local rec center racing him on the track, playing, basketball etc. Despite all this, he has continued to be really disrespectful and defiant. he kept getting off his bike, sitting by the road, and refusing to move. Aside from just straight up ignoring my directions, he keeps saying he \"wants to get me fired\" or he is going to \"tell his parents I was cussing\" and even worse,  \"tell his parents I touched his penis so I can't be a babysitter anymore\". What the actual hell ... \n\nI've kept my cool while he called me fat, and other stupid names kids call people like \"butt pincher\" or \"miss butt face\". He's also hidden my things several times, ran off with the spending money his parents gave me and was playing keep away with it. He thinks it's funny. \n\nAt lunch time he asked me if I had a husband. I said \"no, but I have a boyfriend\". He teased me a bit. And then I jokingly said \"do you have a girlfriend?!\" He started CRYING and ran up to his room and locked his door again. I was so confused. I went up there, apologized for upsetting him/hurting this feelings and explained i just thought we were joking around. He said he was going to tell his parents how mean I am. \n\nI'm at a loss here. Obviously kids say weird stuff sometimes and are known to press boundaries, but this behavior seems to be crossing the line to me, particularly the comments about getting me fired or making false claims about me. I'm super uncomfortable. \n\nAdvise on what to do? I really could use the money and I want to honor my commitment to work the other two days this week. I'm considering just finishing that out and then just not sitting for them again, but I'm not sure if I'm being dramatic about this? Is this type of behavior worth bringing up to the mom for just a one time gig?",

    "title": "Nannying changed my views on parenthood in a big way",
    "text": "I always daydreamed about the perfect family and having 2 kids, had the cliche list of baby names on my phone/Pinterest boards of cute nurseries and everything. My own mom gushed about her motherhood experience and it just seemed so natural to one day become a mother too. I loved kids and nannying felt like the right career choice, and I honestly still feel this way. What I NEVER expected was to have the life altering realization that kids are actually not a good idea (for me personally) and now I can solidly say I am childfree by choice. Most see the glamorized view of parenthood and (if you’re in a heterosexual relationship) fall in love with the concept of carrying 1/2 of your partner, having a mini me etc. What they don’t consider is everything that could go wrong, how their own unhealed traumas can be re-triggered through parenthood, how it often irrevocably impacts your physical/mental/financial health, how it alters each and every one of your relationships and not always in a good way (whether it be family friends or partner), the 24/7 GRIND that is parenting, how “breaks” from parenting can still be stress and guilt inducing, and how until your last breathe you are a parent and that it is truly a lifelong commitment. All of this I have seen firsthand. On top of this, people dive into parenthood without a drop of early childhood education/child development background, assuming that learning the basics/keeping the kid alive will be enough for them to eventually integrate into society as a well adjusted adult (newsflash-the bare minimum is not enough). And don’t even get me started on the children born with any sort of disability/special needs (because this is a real risk many never consider). I do not buy into the religious rhetoric telling us to “be fruitful and multiply” and I sincerely think the propaganda should be more like “hey!! Thinking of having kids?? Think twice!”. So many unfit parents in the world is truly why I think our society is as broken as it is. As a nanny for an UHNW family with 24/7 coverage, I have dealt with the brunt of what parenthood is, and this shit is not fulfilling/satisfying in the way the media portrays and is such a thankless job (and I get paid!!!). I could simply not imagine enduring my long shifts after being up all night too (I understand kids eventually sleep through the night, but sickness/nightmares etc can still disrupt sleep). My nervous system is wrecked from the crying, it’s difficult to eat/go to the bathroom with clingy toddlers, and (as a\nparent) your life and anything you value is put on the backburner when kids are involved (unless you have a fleet of nannies-which TRUST me, brings a wholeee new set of issues to the table). I do believe kids should be the #1 priority for any parent and that is why I can’t have any. I would love my child so much I would forget about myself, then probably feel guilty for wanting a break but desperately needing it. Looking back at my moms description of parenthood I understand why it fulfilled her, she did not have a happy life before and her family “saved” her in a sense, and she never really had a desire for nice things or “treating herself” so financial sacrifice was easy. I am quite different, I value my time, money, self identity and overall autonomy wayyyy too much. It saddens me to browse “regretful parents” on Reddit or any social media platforms where parents complain and often say they weren’t warned about x y z. I wish becoming a parent was not the default choice, because I’d say 75% of the population is unfit for one reason or another. I think children deserve the absolute best and especially in this world, should ONLY be born to knowledgeable, emotionally healthy, financially stable individuals who are completely on board to selflessly care for their child no matter what. And this is NOT to say money is a deciding factor because as this sub proves, money does not necessarily make a good parent either. The point is I never expected to feel this way but I do, if anybody else has similar experiences I’d love to hear them",

    "title": "Nanny spends her own money on my kids",
    "text": "Ok this might not sound like a major issue but I don’t want it to become one. Our nanny takes care of our 2 children, and has been with us for 3 years. She brings them to lots of fantastic places, and routinely spends her personal money on things for our kids. \n\nExamples:\n- They stop at Starbucks on the way to an activity and she buys each kid a small treat. \n- They go to the museum and she will pay for the kids’ entry using cash we leave her, but pay for her admission using her own money. \n- She’ll buy crafts or activities for the kids on her personal trip to Target, the supermarket, etc and refuse reimbursement. \n\nWe appreciate everything she does and have expressed (on multiple occasions!) that we want to cover the costs incurred while she is taking care of our kids. She is routinely spending 1-3 hours of her salary per week doing this. How can we encourage her to spend our money instead of hers? Or should we not care if she doesn’t?\n\nThings we’ve tried:\n- leaving an envelope with ~$100-150 cash for her to access for any reason.\n- offered to leave her a credit card (but she said does not feel comfortable with that). \n- buying memberships and gift cards to the places they frequent. \n\nIs there a standard that I’m missing here? Insight from nannies or nanny families would be appreciated. \n",

    "text": "So, I accepted a live-In Nanny position. I thought we agreed on $10 an hour(although my profile clearly stayed $17/hr). So I get there and start working. I knew that I would have to work around the clock some days as parent travels. What I didn't know was that my work day could be as long as 12 hours or longer. The parent setup automatic payments, so I went to discuss how that would work with fluctuating hours. \n\nTurns out parent thought we agreed to $1600 a month. I had to explain to her that with the hours she wanted me to work that would come out to a little under $5/hr or lower depending on the week, which is below minimum wage. \n\nWe got it figured out(salary still lower than the $10/hr I first agreed to) but I am still shaken by the fact someone was trying to pay me below minimum wage while expecting me to work in any given week over 60 hours.\n\n My typical day is 12 hours w/ an hour lunch. There is generous PTO involved and yes room and board is free, but still it didn't sit right with me.\n\nEdit: Grateful for all the validation for feeling a way about it. I was having feelings of guilt for my uneasiness. ",

    "title": "UPDATE: Nanny letting little girl pee herself at the park",
    "text": "My original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Nanny/s/svRpKSEoNI\n\nA few days after posting that, the girl’s mom gave me a call on a weekday evening. I told her all that I could, letting her know what I did and didn’t hear, everything I witnessed and how her nanny acted. \n\nI wish I could say that the mom sounded shocked and appalled, but she did not. She explained that when they hired their nanny (giving her the fake name Tina) they were just looking for reliability. Tina is a career nanny who has children and grandchildren of her own. Tina very clearly did not have the capacity, in her older age, to care for two rambunctious toddlers but they needed her. The mom explained that in the two years Tina has worked for them, she has never called off (Which is a red flag to me because has she not gotten sick in two years?!). The mom then went on to say that as the kids have gotten older, it’s become more obvious that Tina is no longer equipped. The mom ever stated herself that Tina would be a better fit for an infant. She then went on to explain that they had coincidentally just hired a new nanny and were planning on giving Tina her two weeks notice the following Monday. Even though the mom didn’t seem surprised, she was extremely kind, thanked me, even asked if she could keep my number for occasional babysitting gigs. After the phone call, I was a bit confused at her reaction but thrilled that something was being done for these kids. \n\nFlash forward two and a half months to today: Tina is still nannying the children. I have seen them a handful of times throughout the neighborhood. One time the little girl even came up to me saying “I know you but I don’t know how!” My heart breaks for these two little ones. I wish there was a way I could knock some sense into the parents, but I know that I did what I could and it’s no longer on me. How you could let your nanny continue knowing that she blatantly neglects your children to the point that other people notice is beyond me. \n\nAnd to all those people who told me to “mind my business”, shame on you. It takes a village to raise children, and sometimes that village includes people in the neighborhood and community looking out for them. I will speak up EVERY SINGLE TIME for children who are being mistreated, especially by a paid caregiver whose job it is to protect and nurture. ",

    "title": "April fools! Your sub hasn’t had moderators!",
    "text": "We got the strangest April Fools joke, being accepted to moderate a sub with over 72 thousand members, that hasn’t had an actual moderator in… well a really long time. \n\nSo what's the first order of business? \n-The moderator messages? - average 3 a day every day for the last who knows how long since they were read\n-Reported comments? Over one thousand of them\n-That new post that has over a hundred comments?\n\nI think it’s safe to say that we were a bit overwhelmed. \n\nDue to the personal nature of our jobs and lack of regulatory standards, this industry is very fragmented, with very little structure, and no clear correct way. There is no HR department and very little legislation to help us, we need to help each other! We understand the value that this community has for so many. And we also understand that the subreddit is not in a good place. \n\nWe have already heard from many members on what can be improved, and we are taking that input to heart. \n\nOur goal over the next couple months is to transform this space into a thriving, nanny focused, space. While we want to provide support and education to nanny families our primary goal is to create a supportive and educational environment for nannies, first and foremost.\n\nNot more than 48 hours into modding the sub (less for some), we were handed our first big decision. You likely saw a post from a user who had created a new sub for career nannies. Exciting, right?! We thought so too. Until we thought about it, and discussed it as a group. We know that career nannies are a massive asset to our community, and the knowledge they bring to the table is key to our success. With some new moderating, rules, and routine changes, we really think that everyone can coexist and enjoy the sub together.  We realized that before we endorse a sub just for career nannies that was created because of problems in this sub, we wanted the opportunity to make changes to the sub. For these reasons, amongst others, we have decided we will not be accepting recruitment or advertising posts on this sub for the foreseeable future.\n\nOur goal is to create a space that is free from drama and judgement. Even when child safety comes first, we can still speak to each other in a way that would make the children we raise proud of us. We don’t want to take the fun out of the sub, a bit of sass and an occasional curse word is fine. But we still want to stand by our number one rule. Be kind. \n\nEach of us asked to moderate the sub because we value the community past just a subreddit. We appreciate the value and sense of community that it brings to many people, people who participate in a luxury service that many don’t understand or respect. \n\nSo who are the people who are going to try to get this sub where it deserves to be?\n\nu/NannyDearest : I'm CJ. I was a nanny and estate manager for more than 15 years before having my own child and staying home with them. That was 8 years ago! Since then, I've shifted careers but am still close friends with many people from my nanny community and really enjoy sharing the knowledge and passion I have for child development and caregiving. My hope is to help make this sub better than it ever was, and recreate a space that feels safe and nurturing for all nannies, no matter what stage of their career they find themselves in.\n\nu/Chiffero : I go by Chiffero or Chiff- I have a pretty diverse background, including horseback riding, chronic illness, insurance, cats, fish, video games, and of course kids. I have been a nanny pretty consistently for the last 5 years and don't see myself leaving the field for a while. My favorite age is newborn to 3 years, and my favorite part of raising children is helping them learn and express boundaries and preferences! I’m also dyslexic and really struggle with punctuation so please be patient with me.\n\nu/Beautiful-Mountain73 : I’m G and I’ve been a nanny for a little over 4 years! I took a brief break last year to work at a forensic psychology office so my work experience has been interesting to say the least. My hobbies include photography, penpal-ing, scrapbooking, and baking! I hope to be able to help make some positive changes in this sub and create a supportive space for all of you!\n\nu/Diligent-Dust9457 : I’m AK! I am an artist, CPST, and full time nanny of almost 9 years. I am very passionate about early childhood education and believe strongly in helping children grow into respectful, compassionate, well rounded humans. I am based in the USA but travel both on my own and with my nfs.\n\nu/Every_Tangerine_5412 : I'm Tangerine, full-time working mom of 4, and long-time nanny employer. I fully believe that nannies deserve respect, thriving wage pay, and to be taken seriously as the invaluable childcare professionals that you all are. I want to help guide this community to become a kind, helpful place for both new and career nannies - a place to find camaraderie as well as resources for best-practices in both childcare and advocating for fair working conditions. This sub has become one of the world's primary resources to help change the industry for the better, and it is an honor to be a part of it and to volunteer to help mod this wonderful community. \n\n",

    "title": "Sharing the wildest story from my past nanny families...someone called the cops...",
    "text": "Ok, story time. This is in response to the nanny who quit because of the child. Be glad you got out when you did.  This will probably sound like a movie... but it's 100% scary reality. \n\nI had lost my job unexpectedly when my favorite family got a change to their military orders. I thought that I had walked into the perfect temp job when I started with a new family. They were looking for help for a few months while grandma got ready to move in with them cross country and my new full time family was arriving 2 weeks after their end date.  Plus, the temp family said I could bring my son with me two or three days a week, which would save me a ton on daycare cost.  But as it turned out I was dealing with a child a lot like the one in their post. I did not have any issues with toileting or food. But erratic and sometimes violent behavior started within a few weeks there...\n\nWhen I interviewed they said that their child was incredibly intelligent and very busy but seemed like they would benefit from being in a nanny environment, not in daycare. They felt daycare wasn't challenging enough educationally.  The parents said they had tried daycare for about 6 months, after the child had been raised being home with mom, and that the child was having \"an emotional time of things missing mom\" during the day. (She used to have a work-from-home job and had begun to transition to the office) The first couple of weeks went pretty well as she slowly transitioned out of the house and into the office full time. I would take the kids (nk and my son) to different playgrounds and things during the day when she had meetings or phone calls. One of the local rec centers used to have an open play for rainy days or hot days which was awesome. That's where I saw some of the aggressive behavior but I just chalked it up to the child needing to learn some social skills after basically being home with Mom only for their first few years of life. By week four mom was back in the office full time. On my third full day without mom there, the child had a very angry outburst where they started throwing books and things at me, striking me in the head. They then started kicking my son.  When I tried to redirect them to the quiet spot the parents trained me to use,  the child started punching me on my legs.  I very carefully scooped them up and put the child in their room. They continued trying to bite and scratch me so I pulled the door closed and told them I would let go of the door once I knew we would both be safe. This took nearly an hour.   Discussed it with the parents they said they had seen on the cameras how I handled it and they appreciated how calm I had remained and that that's exactly what they would have done in that same situation. Fast forward another two weeks. \n\nThings begin going better,  I decide I'm going to start trying to take the kid out again. Just to a different park or to try local preschool social activities. As we were driving to an activity that was considerably further away from the house we drove past a daycare center, *not the one the parents had told me they had pulled from*\n\nNK said \"Oh look that's the school I went to but they wouldn't let me go there anymore.\" \n\"Are you sure, I thought mommy told me you went to daycare X right next to the house?\" NK replied \"Oh yes but I went here too they wouldn't let me come anymore because I kept kicking the teacher.\" \n\nA week later we take a different route to a different playground and past yet another daycare. To which NK says \"Oh I remember that school that's the one where they wouldn't let me come anymore because I kept being mean to the other kids in my class. I liked it when they would cry\" \n\nMy red flag went way up and because there had been a few times at that point that NK lashed out at my son,  I reached out to the parents that night. That's when Dad told me that the child had been in a few situations but they assumed it was just a reaction to daycare versus being home with Mom which is why they had hired a nanny. And that they didn't disclose any of NKs behavior issues to me because they did not want me to come into the situation biased if it turned out that the behavior was just being in the daycare environment 🤯 I told them I was disappointed they had not let me know about the issues beforehand and then I wasn't sure I could continue working for them given the lack of disclosure and for my son's safety. They asked me if I would be willing to stay until Grandma could come and start taking care of NK in 8 more weeks, and even offered to pay for me to move my son to 5-day a week care at his home daycare and give me a raise. I reluctantly agreed because financially I couldn't afford to be without a job. Kid had multiple days where they would lash out at me and every time I would put NK in their room until they calmed down. If we went out they were a lot better,  but per the parents,  NK dictated when we would leave places. \nSidenote:\nDuring this time, one day, mom called me to have me pull a file off her computer she forgot. When I went into Mom's office I noticed she had a business card on her bulletin board for the local early childhood intervention agency with a note on the bottom and not her handwriting that said \"please, please call them.\" 🤔\n\nAbout two weeks later my son's daycare was going to be closed for a week,  and my mother-in-law was not available to help me take care of my son the first 2 days.  I reluctantly brought him with me, but by then I had noticed that the child's behavior tended to be better when we were out of the house. I elected to take the kids to the splash pad one of the days, which went well,  so the following day we went to a new playground.  While at the playground NK kept throwing sand at the younger children and laughing, even after I asked them to stop. I told NK that if they did it one more time we were going to have to leave. NK looked right at me and grabbed a handful of sand and threw it directly in another smaller child's face while laughing. So I scooped NK up and carried them over to the car and buckled them into their seat. The whole time NK was screaming at me.  Another mom who was there helped me get my son in the car at the same time and she said she was shocked I was keeping my cool. We pulled away from the park and the whole time the child was screaming at me to take them back to the playground right now, they hated me,  they were going to tell the parents I hit them,  etc. I told NK we could not stay because they were not being kind. As we began driving down the road towards home NK unbuckled themselves from the car seat and proceeded to start punching me in the back of my head and grabbing my seatbelt from behind and yanking it up where it was choking me. I began to lose control of the vehicle and was all over the road. I struggled to get my car into a parking lot and I somehow managed to come to a stop and put the car in park. The whole time NK is continuing to hit me in the back of the head and then once stopped NK turned around and started punching my son and screaming I needed to take them back to the park.  A couple had been following me in the car and had called the police on me for my erratic and dangerous driving. I admittedly had gone into Mama Bear mode when NK started punching my son, so I angrily yanked the door of the car open and yelled \"STOP\" at the top of my lungs, then wrapped my arms around NK to pull them out of the car and away from my son. NK started screaming at me and punching me again and the couple got out of their car.  When NK saw them they yelled, \"Are you ok?\" And NK paused. Then started yelling \"STRANGER DANGER YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY YOU'RE NOT MY MOMMY!!\" And her husband came at me and grabbed him away. At this time the cops rolled up on me, guns drawn. NK smiled at me and said \"now you'll go to jail for not taking me to the park\"\n\nOne of the other officers heard them say this and said \"What do you mean because she's not taking you to the park?\" \n\nAnd NK said \"That's my nanny and I want to go back to the park right now. \"\n\nThe police sent the couple on their way, and came over and started questioning me about what happened. I told them about how NK had unbuckled and had been beating me and they observed and took pictures of the bruises that were forming and the scratches on the neck from where NK had scratched me and where the seatbelt had choked me. They also took pictures of my son who had a few bruises and scratches. I told the police I wanted them to call the dad and that I was not going to go anywhere near the kid again. The police took me and the kids to the station and reached out to nk's Dad. When the gravity of the situation hit them,  NK started telling the police officer that I was lying and that I had hit them. \nBut NK didn't know about my backseat camera set up. Because my son was still rear face and I had trouble attaching a rear view mirror where his seat was I had installed a dash cam  (edit not the right word. A spare phone like  a dashcam in the backseat that I could monitor from my phone on FaceTime). I pulled the footage and showed the parents and the police everything that had happened. I quit on the spot. \n\nAbout 4 weeks later I got a call from Dad boss. He told me that things had not worked out with grandma and that NK had asked him to bring me back to take care of them. Dad boss offered me double my salary. I obviously declined. \n\nI found out several years later from a mom friend who lived in their neighborhood that dad boss and Mom boss had gotten a divorce and that Dad boss had received full custody and that NK was doing much better after being put into a specialty program with lots of resources. I'm very glad that the child got the help that they needed but I will always wonder if things would have gone better had they listened to all of the daycares that told them they needed that early intervention... \n\nEdit to add: this was years ago,  but the other post got me thinking about it!\n\nEdit 2: I'm significantly limited and being able to type things right now because of my hand injury and my TBI has me in a brain fog so I'm terrible with dates or words sometimes. if things don't make sense I apologize.  To clatify... This happened  late 2010ish, and I used two phones on our account with FaceTime to see my son while driving and I would screen record him on the rear view phone because he was hilarious at that age and with my husband working crazy hours I never wanted him to miss out on things.  \n\nEdit 3: yes on a nanny salary. The phones themselves and the cell bill were a gift from my previous Nanny family who I considered my unicorn family. After the move they kept me on their plan for almost 5 years,  as I still helped with their business.  They were in the tech industry and wanted me to have the latest and greatest and DB gave me the phones. The daycare my son was in was a home daycare run by a family friend and she gave me a substantial discount to have him in with her. ",

I am a 34 year old woman who is a Former Kindergarten Teacher and nanny of 15 plus years, so I would say I have had quite a bit of childcare experience.\n\nThe behavior I have seen from children in the last few years is sometimes beyond my comprehension.  I had a Kindergartener tackle me to the ground, and hit me in the face.  His Mom showed up 30 minutes later more upset with me sending him home then his behavior.  I nannied for a family, their 4 year old belittled me constantly in front of them, no consequences.  They just seemed to give up.  Let me add, there are some INCREDIBLE parents I have worked with that show consequences and hold their children accountable.  The last few times I have been in stores I have witnessed blowout meltdowns from 3-4 year olds screaming for a toy.  I talked to my Mom about this, who I truly consider to be an incredible parent, and she said if any of us did that it would be an immediate pickup and were leaving the store situation.  She said that nipped it right in the butt.  If we hit a Teacher in Kindergarten?  Unfathomable.  The stories I tell her always shock her which makes me feel as though a lot of childrens behaviors are getting worse and worse.\n\nI have changed Careers and have never been happier, but I do worry for. the next generation, specifically the ones that never had consequences and grew up thinking they were Gods gift to Earth.

    "title": "Left a unicorn family for a career opportunity just to be fired after a week",
    "text": "I'd been working for a family for 6+ months that I loved and I literally always looked forward to the job. Monday to Friday. It paid well and they were always accommodating when I wanted to work more hours (going from PT to FT) and when it came to benefits. Everything about the job was amazing.\n\nIn August, an agency reached out to me about a position and asked if I would be interested. The family already had a long-term full-time nanny and were looking for another to complement her schedule. Initially, it was for Wednesday to Sunday, but I told the agency I'd be open to the weekend days if the family would be open to that. They ended up finding another nanny to hire at the same time, which I was hoping would cover the weekdays and I'd do the weekend hours, but what worked best for the family was a rotational schedule. Working Monday to Friday,  weekend, Monday to Friday (12 days), and then having the weekend, Monday to Friday, weekend off (9 days).  There were always two nannies scheduled to work during the week, one working an earlier shift and one working a later shift with some overlap. It seemed great, especially because I've been wanting to travel more, on top of the salary being nearly double my previous job.  \n\nIt was truly like a bait-and-switch: I know what I signed up for. I know what I did during the trials. I know that the reality couldn't have been more different. \n\nThere were two kids and the youngest (G3) was absolutely the worst-behaved child I'd ever taken care of. She would hit me, throw things at me, and run away in public. It was a nightmare. And her parents/nanny did nothing to correct her behavior or discipline her. G2 at my previous job was such a delight to take care of and is so sweet/smart/curious. It was jarring going from one extreme to the other and not being able to do anything about it except just take it. \n\nThe job included housekeeper duties like deep-cleaning three bathrooms every single day. I've never worked a housekeeping job. And they did have a full-time housekeeper, she just would focus on the rest of the house and not the children's bedrooms or bathrooms. \n\nI started work on a Monday, worked through Thursday, and then was fired at the end of my first day back on Tuesday following the holiday weekend. I was initially supposed to work continuously, as was scheduled, but their private jet needed last-minute maintenance and they only had enough space for one nanny to drive with them to their country house for the weekend. I didn't get paid for those days but it would've amounted to more than $4200, which I was expecting to have. It was originally supposed to just be me scheduled for the weekend but they wanted the other nanny to train me for how things are at their country house.\n\nI've never felt more discarded/disposable in my entire life, and that's including the poor dating decisions I made in college. It was almost trippy going from nanny families loving me and only having good things to say about me to being made to feel like trash.\n\nMy previous family already hired a new nanny so going back to work for them isn't an option.\n\nI don't regret anything that happened because I truly believe everything happens the way it's supposed to. But yeah... suffice it to say, leaving a unicorn family for more money is not always the best move you can make.",

I’ve been very clear that I’m not expecting a full months salary — or even half of one, but just that that IS a long time to be without employment and some sort of supplement would be appreciated. \nThey’ve seemed very stand off-ish and almost aggravated every time I’ve mentioned this - always brushing it off by saying “we’ll get back to you.” \n\nI’ve also noticed that the two times I’ve mentioned it they then seem to kind of start hounding me a bit. Which is very unlike them. They give me a lot of autonomy. (Mind you, I’m a 25 year old career nanny, not an inexperienced high schooler.) So it almost seems like when I ask about them paying me while they’re traveling, they retaliate by suddenly nit-picking my services to them … almost as a way to maybe “justify” their impending denial. \n\nAlso! The weird thing is is that they have paid me before when they’ve gone out of town! They once took a last minute trip for the holidays and paid me my full weekly pay. So I don’t understand what’s so different about this. \n\nWhat do I do? ",

    "title": "From Salary to Hourly",
    "text": "Hello! I’d love some advice on what’s fair for next year.\n\nCurrently, I make $98k/year salaried as a nanny. My required availability is 6:30am–6:30pm, and currently the child is in school Tuesday–Friday from 8:30–12. I do housework/cleaning two of those days.\n\nBefore NK started school, I was hourly at $27/hr, and I always made good money because of the overtime, which is what bumped me up to the salary I’m on now. \n\nStarting next fall, the child will be in school 8:30–3:30, Monday–Friday. My availability is still 6:30am–6:30pm, but obviously I won’t be working the same amount of active childcare hours. The family wants to keep me on and is offering 40 guaranteed hours per week.\n\nI don’t expect to stay at $98k with the reduced active hours, but I also still want to be in a similar income range — because realistically, I could work for multiple families, or more for one family, and get 60 hours/week if I needed to in order to keep around my current income.\n\nI’m thinking of asking for mid-to-upper $30s/hr. Even though that looks like a raise from my old $27/hr hourly rate, it’s still more than a $20k pay cut for me overall.\n\nDoes that seem fair? How would you approach the conversation, and what rate would you ask for?\n\nAlso, thank you for the response on my previous post. I know a lot of you said that I should be paid for 60 hours a week. I'm fine with 40 as long as I'm paid adequately. One more thing.. I know this is a far out situation but the family wants to know my decision soon! Thanks for any input. \n\n\nEDIT:\n I’m not actually classified as salaried. My pay is technically hourly + OT — it’s just structured as a consistent stipend every pay period, so “salary” is the easiest shorthand when explaining it. It’s run through a payroll company, but I know it’s not a perfect FLSA setup. I’m not asking for legal auditing on my current arrangement, just advice on what hourly rate to request going forward.\n\n",

    "title": "AITA for quitting with less than 2 weeks notice, leaving a nanny family without childcare arrangements for the summer?",
    "text": "I (36f) worked as a nanny for 2 families. It started with the second family (NF2) on an emergency basis and then became full-time tandem care (4 kids total). NF2 initially offered pay embarrassingly below minimum wage. I accepted at the time because I was barely keeping my head above water with my other (minimum wage) nanny job. Over time, both families gave me raises, but NF2 was still paying below min wage. For context: high min wage state, relatively LCOL area. \n\nSince then, I've combined finances with my fiance and discovered NF2 was not as strapped as they claimed: 3 incomes between 2 households (attorney, retired military member who still works part time, and a hospice nurse), and they spend on custom EVs, some luxury clothing/bags, food subscriptions, international trips, lots of vacations, etc. \n\nThis fall, NF2's youngest will be in school full-time. Anticipating a cut to pay/hours, and knowing our arrangment was likely illegal, I proposed keeping my current salary through fall, which would've brought me to legal minimum wage. I made this proposal over 3 mos before summer, to give them plenty of time to adjust or plan. \n\nThey didn't respond until 12 days before the deadline--after multiple check-ins, and set the attorney step-parent in charge of negotiations: What followed was a frustrating back-and-forth: \n\n* They countered with a higher rate than before but still below state minimum wage.\n*  I explained this wasn't legal (to an attorney) and offered to more precisely count hours using the school and personal calendars. \n* I said if we couldn't agree, I would like my last day to be at the end of this pay period: 12 days notice.\n* They quibbled about paying for 9-hour days, offering only 8, even though I'm not guaranteed a break.\n* I suggested taking unpaid vacation and eliminating paid holidays, but then realized overtime was necessary to factor in.\n* They argued they shouldn't have to pay when they were on vacation or when grandma visits, and offered no overtime. They suggested maybe we should switch to hourly instead of salary\n* I said hourly was ok with me and asked for a 10 hour guaranteed minimum, which I have with the other family as well. \n* They walked back hourly and wanted salary again. \n* I agreed to go to salary but only thru Dec this time because min wage is going up next year, with their vacations and mine unpaid, no guaranteed hours.\n\nThen she responded claming that this was a \"nanny share\" and I should be content because with both families combined I was \"more than double minimum wage,\" and accused me of being \"frustrating and difficult,\" \"frankly unfair,\" and \"going up and up and up.\"\n\n1. We never agreed to or discussed being in a nanny share.\n\n2. I looked into nanny share laws in my state and learned this would require a license due to the number of kids and location. I would've been putting myself at legal risk to continue under this arrangement. \n\nHer accustations highly offended me and because I'm no longer desperate, I gave them notice 2 days before the summer schedule would have started. Note: My final offer was only $67 more per paycheck than their last offer and $133 less than what they were already paying me. \n\nNow they have no childcare arranged and I'm sure they're upset. She sent a manipulative apology with lots of \"ifs\" and emotional appeals about the kids and what they could \"afford.\" \n\nI do feel bad for the kids, but I gave them months to prepare, negotiated in good faith, and wasn't willing to keep breaking the law for their convenience.\n\nAITA?\n\nEdit: parent careers for extra context",

A*** seemed great. She’s Jewish, my last family is as well. I know the prayers, songs, we do Shabbat, etc.\n\nI was having concerns that I should’ve mentioned to you beforehand. Excuse me for that. I am 1000% looking for a Live-In but I always do my research and after hearing her out and doing the logistics, this job is going to be tough.\n\nFrom what I’ve gathered, the pay is currently hourly(market value). Any time after that is paid. Salary vs hourly. That is what I’m seeing/hearing as the minimum. The salaried individuals seem to have been taken advantage of or burnt out from so much work.\n\nI understand your clients have different values and needs, that’s absolutely ok. I am actually the 1st gen America in my family, my parents are immigrants. \nI put my absolute all into my work and value being compensated accordingly.\n\nI am looking forward to working with you because something may come along that matches what I’m looking for.”\n\n‼️Agency owner reply‼️\n\n“I will tell A**** and try to disregard your application as well.  She would also be offended by the idea of someone who expects to be paid as a salary employee, meaning during downtime for three or four hours on a day you really don’t have anything to do and are in the house alone, you’re still getting paid, during days where you have doctors appointment you’re still getting paid, vacations and holidays time you’re still getting paid, but also want the work to be exact hours like an hourly employee. This sort of have your cake and eat it to model is something too many of the nannies in your age range are demanding and families thankfully see the red flags with those candidates and skip them.  I’m really thankful we reached this clarity now rather than after my clients investor time in the relationship.  There are many many nannies on Facebook groups, pouting about the sort of arrangements are what is fair and what all nannies today need to demand, but I will point out that those women are currently unemployed and sitting around on Facebook groups. The nannies who families do employee Are those who are willing to work out a situation that is fair for both sides. That model certainly is not. May you find the job that you merit.”\n\nAgain, this is because I noticed the pay/benefits and hours/responsibilities didn’t match up. The family was paying salary. 5 kids. \nPlus up to 3 times a week of being on call for date nights🙂🙂🙂🙂\nIf anyone is interested in the agency that sent this, I’ll send it via DM.",

    "text": "As my title says, I am planning to leave my current NF soon. After 5.5 years of providing amazing care- going above and beyond, accommodating so much, showing up when they needed me, helping when I could, teaching their girls so much- they’ve disrespected me in such a cruel way. \n\nWhen I started with them, I had and still have a contract for up to 52 hours (GH, with OT). They raised it to 55 hours (3 years in). I haven’t gotten any raises the past 2 years. I stayed because the pay was nice and the new schedule was working. When we discussed a new schedule, MB told the money would stay the same even though they’re reducing the hours.  MB said they weren’t reducing hours because of the money- it was to make the hours work better for me and provide structure for their girls. Now, 1.5 years later, they’re lowering my salary pay. They didn’t give me a raise at the end of the year. Just a small bonus. Then, they tell me today they want to discuss everything. And want to up the rate but can’t guarantee full time hours anymore. I’d be taking a $26k cut in the salary. And we are in a very HCOL- 30 mins outside of Manhattan! Sitting in a mega mansion- telling me “we’re paying for hours we couldn’t give you for work”.  I explained what GH are and how I’ve done that will all my previous families- especially the one I stayed 10 years with! The conversation we had today makes no sense. MB wouldn’t even look me in the eyes. And honestly, I don’t even know if I’m making any sense right now. \nMB kept telling me she didn’t know what to do and then wouldn’t look me in the eyes. \n\nI’m so over it. They’re so selfish. I felt so disrespected and upset. When I spoke to my cousin who is an attorney, he pointed out some stuff to me which I’ll bring up in a conversation on Monday. But, it’s time for me to move on. I stayed long enough. I’m sure when I resign, I’ll hear how they can’t do anything without me. That their household runs well because of me. Everyone they know is always praising me and letting them know how lucky they are to have as their nanny. But, I’m done giving my all for so little in return. They can either match what I’m looking for or find someone else. I already have interviews lined up for different positions. Once I have a new signed contract, I’m putting in my notice. Just so sad because I’ll miss the kids so much. They’re my babies. 🥺",

It absolutely baffles me that some families think it’s okay to pay people less than minimum wage for an EXTREME amount of responsibility and labor. I see this so often where families have the most high expectations such as caregiving, nannying, meal planning, household manager, etc, but pay absolute close to nothing!! It’s genuinely concerning and should not be accepted. When did we forget that nanny and household managers are a luxury. ",

That breaks down to about $28.85/hour with no OT rate before taxes.\n\nIn all my previous positions, I’ve been paid hourly with overtime (1.5x) for anything over 40 hours/week, so I’m used to that structure. The family said they originally paid their last nanny hourly too, but the agency advised them to switch to a salary. They’re open to discussing pay further, and I want to make sure I’m advocating for myself fairly.\n\nDoes $90k sound reasonable for 60 hours/week as a salary? Or should I push for a different structure—like hourly with OT, or a higher salary to account for the extra hours? Would love to hear thoughts from other nannies or anyone familiar with industry standards. Thanks in advance!",

    "title": "Am I Being Scammed Out of Pay by my Bosses?",
    "text": "Hi everyone! I'm suddenly having a bit of a situation with my bosses regarding guaranteed hours and am a bit confused and need some clarity before responding to them. I'm fairly sure I've understood everything in my contract correctly, but there are a few things that are contradictory so I'm not sure what to go off of. \n\nTo start, I'm a nanny for a little boy and consistently work 45 hours per week. I've attached a screenshot of my listed work hours, but as stated they are: [M-Th 8:00AM-5:00PM and Friday 9:00AM-5:00PM](https://imgur.com/6qALUTo) (it's worth noting that I have only actually worked 9:00AM twice since starting with them in November and have done 8:00AM-5:00PM every other time. \n\nIn my contract, I am guaranteed 40 hours of work per week [\"unless otherwise agreed ahead of the commencement of the week\"](https://imgur.com/pPLeNZ5). Also, my contract states that [\"When the parent(s) do not need the nanny during the regular work hours, the nanny will be paid full salary\"](https://imgur.com/qaRtmea). The little boy's grandma is in town so I anticipated there to be some changes in the schedule, but because of my contract, I was also expecting to be paid my regular amount as I was available and they did not need me. I was given Tuesday, February 11th off and that evening, they texted me asking to do 9:00AM-4:00PM moving forward while his grandma is in town so she could spend more time with him. \n\nAnyway, I filled out my timesheet and added in my usual work hours of 8:00AM-5:00PM based off of my understanding of being paid for my usual hours when I am not needed. Also noting that I agreed to the lesser hours of 9-4 on Tuesday, which, if we're being pedantic, is not \"ahead of the commencement of the week.\" \n\nSo, my timesheet is due on Friday's and I received a text from my boss stating that the contract has provisions for them to change the work schedule and she finds it [\"rather disturbing\"](https://imgur.com/4AuMFnz) that I agreed to a new schedule then asked to be paid based on the old schedule. The provision she's referring to states that [\"the location or schedule may be changed from time to time by the Parent(s).\"](https://imgur.com/6qALUTo)\n\nI'd be okay removing the \"usual hours\" and just being paid for the guaranteed 40 rather than the 45 but it seems like they'd probably have an issue with that as well. I only inputted the 8-5 in the timesheet as that's what was listed under my contracted work hours and that's what I thought the provision about being paid full salary meant. \n\nI'm unclear if I've just severely misinterpreted my contract and my boss is correct, but I wanted to get some advice here to be sure before I reply because I don't want to be unpaid for something if I rightfully should be. I'm not trying to scam anyone out of money--I just filled out my timesheet based on my understanding of things and I know nanny's tend to be taken advantage of, especially in LA so I want to be cautious. Thank you in advance!",

    "text": "Context: I’ve been a career nanny for 6+ years at this point. With two long term placements and many a babysitting/short terms sprinkled throughout for many years. \n\nOkay rant starting. I feel like an insane person sometimes but I swear to god no one I’ve worked for has proper boundaries with their children. This may specifically be an issue due to where I live who knows but I’d say 98% of people I’ve worked with even my long term placements, parents have absolutely no clue how to properly communicate firm steadfast boundaries with their toddlers/children. \n\nEvery single parent I’ve worked for even if they are kind and considerate people are passive parents who being honest? Would rather hand their child and iPad/TV/phone than hear a meltdown. It has consistently been a problem with almost every family I’ve met where I come in Monday morning and I can tell the kids dopamine receptors have just been fried by screens over the weekend. If not screens it’s a constant barrage of ensuring meltdowns don’t happen whether that’s bribery, new toys, constant activity etc. it is good for a child to be bored. It is good for a child to independent play. It is good for child to feel a broad range of emotions including disappointment, frustration, anger. Your job as a parent is helping your child understand what to do with those feelings. NOT to quell them right away with some distraction/bribe etc. no should mean no. If I tell my nanny kids no to something at the store they know I’m serious because that is solid and consistent boundary I set. \n\nI feel like this generation of parents has such loose and flexible boundaries. Which don’t get me wrong. Flexibility is important as a parent and vital to managing expectations but passiveness is not. And this is not coming from some old school nanny. I am in my twenties! I’m Gen Z! And I am incredibly pro informed, emotionally aware, gentle yet authoritative parenting. It’s the kind of nanny I am! And to me it is so obvious sometimes when I see a toddler practically begging for a boundary and consistency. \n\nThis rant is partially brought on just by the fact that I moving on from the nanny industry to further my education and am admittedly probably a little burnt out and perhaps slightly jaded. And none of this a personal attack to parents just a broad observation of my specific experiences and community. None of this applies to cases of neurodivergence/disabilities etc of course.  Just wanted to rant as I’m sure other Nannies have similar experiences I mean hell it’s a joke so mainstream that iPad baby trends are all over tik tok so I know it’s not just me. Thanks for reading all the way if you did. ✌️\n\nAdding to this it is also so insane being a nanny and realizing that some of these people have wealth and luxuries so beyond anything I could imagine. Multiple houses, Airbnb properties, car leases the same amount as my rent, shopping trips that could pay off my credit card bill. \n\nLike if you want to become class conscious become a nanny. \n\nAnd I wouldn’t even categorize myself as poor I’m just working class and make a relatively good living as a nanny well above minimum wage and I still struggle with bills every month. \nPart of me is very nervous to no longer be a nanny because being a graduate student means saying goodbye to my above minimum wage job and instead working a minimum wage social work job for the sake of my resumé and experience for the hope that one day I’ll be able to make a salary high enough to pay off my debts and live in a townhouse with my partner supporting my cats 😂",

    "title": "Live-in nanny 6:30–6:30 $600/week — looking for advice on raise",
    "text": "\nHi everyone, I’d love some feedback from other nannies.\n\nI’m a live-in nanny in a small town in SW Virginia. I’ve been with this family for two years, going on three. I live in a private mother-in-law suite with my husband, who is going to school with two years left, and dog (rent and utilities included). The suite is attached through garages but otherwise separate, so it’s more like an apartment. Housing was part of the compensation when I accepted the job. I’m also paid under the table (I know that’s controversial).\n\nThe job/family:\n\t•\t3 kids: 12, 9, and 2\n\t•\tHours: 6:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m. minimum, sometimes until 7:30–8:30 p.m.\n\t•\tI have the 2-year-old full time every day unless “Auntie” (mom’s former nanny, now working for her company) steps in briefly. Even then, I’m usually still working with the older kids or dogs.\n\nPay &amp; benefits:\n\t•\t$600/week flat salary (under $10/hour if you count my hours)\n\t•\tNo health insurance, groceries, retirement, or other benefits beyond housing/utilities and use of the family car for kid-related driving\n\t•\tOccasional dog-sitting when they travel (sometimes weekends too)\n\t•\tPaid time off: Thanksgiving Eve + Thanksgiving + Black Friday, two weeks at Christmas, spring break week, and other banking holidays\n\t•\tThey watch my dog if I need it\n\t•\tChristmas bonus and birthday bonus\n\nSummer/breaks workload:\nWhen I accepted the job, I was told summers and school breaks would be lighter since the older kids stay with their dad a lot. In reality, I’ve still had the toddler full time (7:30 a.m.–6:30 p.m.) every day unless the whole family traveled. On those trips, I was usually asked to watch the dogs. I’ve said no before (like when I had my own vacation planned), but it always feels like I’m inconveniencing them.\n\nWhy I’m asking:\nI genuinely love this job, the housing is great (private, VERY nice), I can bring my dog, and the setup works well for my husband and me. We will be here two more years at least so he can finish school. But $600/week feels very low for the amount of work I do. Local nannies (not live-in) are getting $17–20/hr. At my hours (60 a week minimum), that would be $1020-$1200 before factoring in housing. At this point, I’m making below minimum wage and I know I can argue that part. \n\nIn our “rental contract,” the suite is valued at $1,100/month, but that doesn’t really offset the extra hours I work.\n\nI’d like to ask for $1200–$1400/week. I realize for some nannies that might still seem low, but since I originally accepted this role at a much lower rate, I don’t think I can convince them to go higher. For context, before this I was working as a behavior therapist and the pay wouldn’t have covered rent/utilities in the area we were moving to, so I took this job despite feeling it was on the low end. Where I came from, it is extremely easy to find a nanny to work for minimum wage. I thought this was my best bet. \n\nRecent update: She actually gave me a $50 raise this week (to $650) because her auto payment system had to be reset. She knows I’d like to formally revisit the nanny agreement at an upcoming performance review.\n\nMy questions:\n\t•\tIs $1200–$1400/week a fair ask, considering separated housing is included?\n\t•\tHow can I frame this without sounding ungrateful?\n\t•\tAny advice from those who’ve successfully renegotiated live-in contracts?\n\n\nEDIT \n\nI hear everything everyone is saying so far. I would love to ask for so much more or just move and find something else. There’s just no way I could find a job that would pay me enough without me having to still be working 60+ hour weeks. And be working somewhere I hate. I really don’t think that mom would say no to a significant raise if I was able to bring something to her and show how much I should be making. But every place I look for my area, nannies make $16-$24 at the very most (degrees/years of experience taken into consideration there). Virginia unfortunately doesn’t legally require OT for live in workers. So that’s off the table. I feel confident in arguing for hourly pay. And I think I will go that route and say I’d rather keep track of my hours each week. I’m looking for advice on how to appropriately approach this in a performance review where we will be reevaluating the contract. How can I ask for $25-$30+ an hour when I can’t find anything saying that’s how much I should be charging besides Reddit users? No one is going to take that seriously. I need back up and resources and tips on how to approach it professionally. I have SCOURED the internet and I cannot find anything close to that besides Reddit. Even care.com says $17.88 is typical for the biggest city in my area. \n\nEDIT 2\n\nEverywhere I’m looking says live in workers in Va are not given overtime. Also all I can find are things saying you can absolutely include living arrangements as compensation as long as it’s agreed upon at the hire. There’s some things that say no, some say yes, some say yes but it shouldn’t be a large amount. I can’t just claim things without reasonable back up for it. I’m not sure what I could show to fight that fight. This is why I’m asking. If I come with stuff to show, I fully believe I can get what I want. But I can’t just say it. When I look at multiple nanny postings near me (up to 100 miles) they are going from $13-$18 an hour or $500-700 a week for full time. I’m can’t find anything that’s posted for more than that unless it CA or NY based. Even ones in Tennessee are under $20 an hour. ",

    "text": "Hi all, I'm a mom to a 2.5 year old and recently just had another baby (1 month old). Our nanny has been with us for about 2 years (since my oldest was 6 months). In that time, husband and I have noticed that she's not always receptive to feedback, and any conversations with her about changes to my son's routine, how to discipline, etc. always end with her being defensive, her crying, and listing out/boasting about all the things she does for our kids. This dynamic has been frustrating for us, but we've generally overlooked it because she's very affectionate with the kids. She's also been pretty unreliable for certain periods - since last year her adult daughter has been in and out of the hospital, which has resulted in her taking days off at a time with basically no notice (i.e. a text at 8am saying that she's not coming in). This put a strain on my husband and I for our work schedules and trying to find coverage, but we accommodated because we empathize with her situation and because she was very caring with our son. \n\n  \nThe other day, we tried to offer some feedback and the conversation did not go well, and ultimately resulted in her giving us notice. Later that day she apologized, said she got emotionally overwhelmed (her daughter has been back in the hospital, which we empathize with), and rescinded her notice. We let it go and agreed to just move on. \n\nA few days after this incident, nanny started texting my mom saying that she was leaving us because she doesn't feel appreciated by us. My mom told me about this separately, and to our face nanny was still apologizing to us for giving notice and saying that she would be there for us when we needed her (even in the days after sending my mom these messages). \n\nI feel it's inappropriate for her to be messaging my mom if she has issues with our working relationship, and I was very taken aback that she was telling us that she'd like to stay while telling my mom the opposite. \n\nI was also very surprised that she felt unappreciated. I'll admit that I'm not always the most vocal with my praise aside from thanking her throughout the day, which is something I can certainly work on, but I feel that I've always tried to show my appreciation for her in other ways (such as whatever pay rate she asked for plus a raise, unlimited sick time and effectively unlimited PTO, giving her PTO on little to no notice when her daughter was in the hospital, salary advances whenever she's asked and that were paid back however and whenever she asked for, cards/gifts on her birthday and holidays, holiday bonus paid early, allowing her to leave early/come in late whenever she needed, etc.). \n\n  \nLooking for other perspectives here on whether it's reasonable for me to be bothered by this, how I can handle bringing this up with the nanny, and whether any of this is fixable or if it's just time to move on. Thanks in advance! ",
