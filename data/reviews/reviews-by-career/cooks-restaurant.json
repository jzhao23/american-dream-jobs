    "text": "I have been struggling with my career lately.  The spark had been flickering.  I’ve spent a lot  of my career in management positions at high end- large volume restaurants and kept running into the same problems.    \n\nI came to a breaking point and decided to start over again in the world of fine dining as a Stagiaire in a restaurant chasing its third Michelin star. \n\nIt was hard.  Taking orders from people half your age and humbly saying “Yes chef”- but honestly it’s the best thing I could have done and I feel inspired in my cooking again.  I plan to repeat the experience again somewhere else next year- and would recommend this to any chef who feels “stuck” in their career.\n\nI made this documentary if you’d  like to know more.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/Tr8KJ4EdN_g?si=DHnPW99Cey5ZNWKH\n",

    "text": "I worked at this bistro for 3 years, I was the sous chef for the final year. Almost to the day. Like the title says, I walked and they closed.\n\nMother’s Day week, I worked 106 hours and slept there once. Only paid for 50, since I was on salary, which amounted to $404 in 2022. That in itself is some shit, but I wouldn’t have left over it. Day after Mother’s Day, the owner tells me I’m not doing enough for the company. I was flabbergasted and sat with it all day.\n\nThe next morning, like 7am, I was out back with the executive chef smoking a couple cigarettes before putting together a catering and it just hit me like a ton of bricks, I’m not doing this anymore.\n\nI looked at the executive chef and exact words said “it’s been real man, I’m going home”. He laughed and then looked at me all concerned like really? “Yeah dude I’m for real, I’m sorry, but I’m out. It’s been a long ass week, it’s been a long ass day (remember it was like 7am I just got there), it’s been real dawg, I’m leaving.”\n\nHe went upstairs without a word, I wrote burn baby burn on the dumpster, and then got 2 trash bags full of all of the equipment I brought in from home for them, I stuffed 2 beers in my pocket, nodded to the EC and drove off.\n\nYou bet your ass that wasn’t even close to the first straw. I talked to one of my old employees after they closed and he said after I left it was complete mayhem, they couldn’t keep staff, cleaning went undone, they couldn’t find another lunatic to fill the role of sous there obviously, the EC got burned to the ground (hate that for him), hard drugs spread like a wildfire, food quality dropped massively, they eventually stopped getting their biggest catering customers and that bitch closed. For reference, our local food magazine voted us best restaurant of the previous year (my town is only 40k population). Lo and behold, I leave and they’re wiped off the map. Smiling as I type this. I’m not saying I’m the reason they were open, I’m not that arrogant, but I was the glue that held that kitchen together. Who didn’t do enough for your company? You fucking cunt, eat shit.\n\nA short victory story for under appreciated chefs everywhere. ",

    "title": "I’m convinced that servers in the US don’t actually want to be paid a livable wage.",
    "text": "So I remember being a sous chef, I worked infinitely harder and longer than every server in the building, but my take home pay was $404 a week (I was on salary, that’s my own fault and not entirely relevant to this argument). Meanwhile, every single night I heard servers complain when they “only made $150 today”. Compare my 14 hour work day to their 5 hour work day.\n\nMy wife was a server for 7 years. There were some jobs where she hardly made anything, there were some jobs where she made bank and didn’t even have to think before buying anything. Here’s the main thing, you hear servers say all of the time in America “well maybe if we got paid a livable wage instead of relying on tips it would be different, but until then tipping is a requirement and if you can’t afford to tip then don’t eat out!” but I’ve offered to pay my servers a livable wage and split tips with the whole restaurant, (AFTER hearing them say that for weeks!) they all said they would walk out that same day if it went into effect. My wife tends to agree as well, they don’t want to be paid well, they want to rely on tips, because the earning potential is FAR higher that way. Furthermore, a server can quit anywhere and start anywhere else almost in a heartbeat, they don’t have to be there, if the money really really sucks, they can and will leave.\n\nOn paper, they make $2 an hour plus tips. In reality, they often make more than anyone else in the building. They have the POTENTIAL of making $30-50 an hour. Hell I’ve seen bartenders make upwards of $100 an hour some days, so why the fuck would they accept a measly $20 an hour? I wouldn’t in their position and you wouldn’t either, it’s just basic math, so it’s all bullshit to get you to feel bad and tip more.",

    "text": "This is not a message for everyone, this is a PSA for anyone who has never worked in a restaurant that’s about to go through or is considering going through culinary school, so they can be a chef. If you’ve been in the industry for a while, you enjoy it as a career and you feel like going to culinary school, this isn’t for you. \n\nThis question is asked all of the time, should I go to culinary school. My two cents, absolutely not. First things first, return on investment is very low. Secondly, it doesn’t matter if you’ve gone to the culinary institute of America, you’re not going to start out as a sous chef. You’ll be at the very bottom, same as the guy who didn’t go to culinary school and within 2 years you’ll both have the same knowledge database, assuming the other guy is passionate and asks questions, except he won’t be in debt. \n\nI’ve seen literally no exaggeration hundreds of culinary school graduates who start in a restaurant and nope the fuck out within a few months, then switch to a different career. See if it’s actually what you want to do first, at least. It’s not like what you’re probably imagining. The hours are grueling, the pay is shit unless you land a good corporate gig, rarely will you find benefits or paid time off, holidays are gone, your coworkers will know you better than your family. With that said, obviously people do this for a reason, including myself. That reason is passion. It’s easy to have passion for cooking when you aren’t a cook. You may love making a dish using chicken thighs, but stand in one spot for 3 hours cutting chicken thighs and tell me how you feel about chicken thighs. I promise the answer is fuck those chicken thighs lol. You love making cheesecake, so do I, I’m a slut for cheesecake, but I’ve made thousands of them and my view on the subject is probably less romanticized. \n\nBe a chef, by all means, we welcome you with open arms. I love this career, there’s almost nothing else I’d want to do, this is the life for me, it could be the life for you, but for the love of god, don’t go to culinary school. ",

    "text": "Link to the original post if you didn't see it before ⬇️\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/3X5s1UgV30 the\n\n\nSo here's a fun little update. First of all, I already found a much better job so I'm jumping ship immediately like everyone commenting on the original post was saying. But today I found this notice just sitting right on top of the printer in the office. Given the balance due, I can only assume he hasn't been paying the lease at all since we opened. I don't care about professionalism anymore because this man who has the audacity to call himself a \"chef\" doesn't know the meaning of the word. People who fuck up this badly in this industry deserve to be outed for the sake of all the people whose livelihoods they disrupt. \n\nTo recap, the \"famous award-winning chef\" Matt Horn managed his multiple restaurants so badly that he couldn't pay his employees, his vendor, and now his rent on time. Barely 4 months after opening his Elk Grove location, we're already about to get shut down because his obsession with being a restauranteur has prevented him from paying for his existing locations. Instead of just being happy with having one or two popular, profitable, well-managed locations, he decided to open multiple locations at once in cities that are HOURS away from each other.\n\nHe's been dumping all our money (yes, our money, because we haven't been getting paid on time) into opening a location in Fresno because that's his hometown apparently. If you aren't familiar with Fresno California, it is a certified shit hole. And it's a 3-hour drive from the Elk Grove location. Fresno is hardly what one would consider to be a culinary tourism destination. But yeah, it makes perfect business sense to open an expensive BBQ restaurant in the crime-riddled, drug-infested armpit of California. I'm sure all those people doing the fent fold outside the front door of the new restaurant will draw huge crowds!\n\nIf Matt sees this, I want him to know he has no business being in our industry. You were a retail salesman who decided he wanted to cook, and you got lucky on social media where you can construct and influencer narrative to make yourself look good. Just because you can smoke some meat and post a cool video doesn't make you a Chef. Chef is a title you earn after years of hard work and experience in our industry. You never worked your way up like a real Chef. You never worked in any real restaurants at all. You never even bothered to learn the most basic business practices necessary for running a restaurant properly. You don't get to hurt your employees by making them late on their rent and car payments. You're a joke. You wear big your stupid cowboy hat and sit out there in the dining room doing social media interviews acting like you're some hot shot while your employees, vendors, and landlord are all asking where the hell their money is. Shame on you, Matt. Shame. Do our entire industry a favor and sell your locations, cut your losses, and get a job as a line cook in a real restaurant so so you can learn how restaurants are supposed to be run. \n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me rant. Hope you guys enjoyed it. I'm washing my hands of Horn BBQ and \"award-winning chef\"  Matt Horn. I'm not even going to bother following him to see his career crash because I can already see the trajectory. ",

    "text": "For the past 14 years I have been a salaried chef.  Constraints of labor statistics literally put me in a position of *needing* to work 60 to 80 hours a week.  I didn't have a choice.  It was my name on the menus and my pride wouldn't let my places of employment fail.  \n\nOver the years i experienced coming home to my wife crying because I had to shower, go to bed, and wake up st 5a to go back.  I missed my kids school plays and concerts.  The 1000s of times I came home to cold dinner in the fridge, I missed having dinner with my family again... But this was all I knew.  I was in my 40s, a career change now wouldn't keep the mortgage paid. \n\nI tried different things- healthcare, higher ed... nope..  no change.  Still the same grind but with even more toxicity in some cases.  So I stuck with higher ed, because at least there were some \"breaks\" where things slowed down for parts of the year.  \n\nI kept watching Indeed.  Will my perfect job show up?  The job market worsened and I felt a deep depression.  I felt stuck.  Burnt.  Aging and fucking *stuck.*\n\nA few months ago something popped up that really piqued my curiosity.  A union job managing a grocery deli (a 14k yearly pay cut, but hourly pay with insanely good benefits.)  Immediately I started researching.  Were my skills transferable?  \n\nI applied.  I had to lie about family emergencies to go interview.  I met the GM.  (Great dude, we hit it off immediately.)  We talked about a day in my life at my work.  A day in the life of a hypothetical deli manager.  And they lined up.  Big time.\n\nI accepted the position two days after interviewing.  Asked for a three week start date so I could enjoy a 1 week breather.   They obliged without hesitation.  \n\nThe job-  holy shit, folks.  I get to schmooze with the customers.  We talk about food.  There is a lot of surprise in customer's eyes as i suggest cheeses to go with their freshly sliced meats and give advice on recipes to take them over the top...\n\nI work 7 to 3.  I am *forced* to take the two 15 minute mandated breaks.  I had to get used to my staff not hustling 24-7, but shit, we get everything done, and our clientele genuinely seems thrilled with our foods.  I get to use my skills with our shrink (waste in the chef's world) and spread it into corporate recipes, helping the bottom line. Easy.  \n\nI will always miss the creativity, but that desire is fulfilled in a different outlet... cooking dinner for my family every night.",

I work from 5am until 7pm with a two hour break in between. I've been to 40 countries. Snorkeled in Guam. Climbed a glacier in Alaska. Hiked a mountain in Hawaii.

If you are good chef, good at cooking, training and planning then I'd like you to consider coming to work for NOAA. There are some requirements. You need a Merchant Mariners Credential (possibly being waived, NOAA will help you get in first year), a TWIC, a passport, your vaccinations and a basic safety course. It all takes time and about a $2000 investment. But I am telling you that this is an amazing job with excellent benefits. Health, Dental, Vision.

Real time with your family.\n\nI've attached a copy of my latest paycheck to verify what I am saying is reliable.  Sometimes you get laiud up at a dock or do repair yard work and then the pay isn't this good but it's still $3000 or so.\n\nMessage me if you are interested and we'll chat.

    "text": "So we have been open for about 3 years now. The first year our Good Friday was slow because we were still new and word hadn't gotten around. Last year on GF we did about $5000 in sales. This year we did nearly $7000 in sales. To put that in perspective, a really good Friday would be around $3500-$4000 in sales. \n\n  \nLast night our expo walked out middle of supper rush and just abandoned us. Needless to say by the time we were finally done everyone was exhausted, we were beat down and burned out. My boss said just do the -absolute- min we had to do to get out, as he didn't want to have to pay 1.5X pay just to do cleanup and dishes, and that he would come in early today and do them all. \n\nAfter working a 14 hour shift (Everyone else worked 6-8 hour shifts) I didn't say boo, I was completely and utterly exhausted as literally $5000 of that $7000 sales were fish and chips and I am on fryers. \n\n  \nSo today I woke up and was already tired and ready to be done but stuff had to be done, prepped, cleaned etc. for tonight so I was at work at 10:30 this morning. I was already pissed off at my boss for other BS stuff when he calls me at 11:00 wondering why I was at the restaurant already (I am kitchen manager and put in 2-3x as many hours as everyone else) and I told him I had a TON of stuff to get ready for tonight, etc. He tells me he needs to go to the bulk produce store to get a box of sweet potatoes and then he would be in to help with cleanup. AT THREE THIRTY HE WALKS IN AND ASKS WHY THE KITCHEN IS STILL A DISASTER!!!!!!!\n\n  \nOn top of that we had a PVC pipe break in the basement leading to a bunch of water pouring directly onto the hot water tank, shorting it out, so no hot water for the night...\n\n  \nI told my boss I am not working till Wednesday as I needed a few days off to rest after a brutal few weeks and I am VERY strongly looking in to a anonymous tip to the health inspector about the lack of hot water and putting out some resumes as, to be blunt, my boss cannot afford to pay me what I am worth. (I do all the scheduling, inventory, most of the ordering, deliveries, most of the prep, I open-close 6 days a week, average 55-65 hours per week and am paid 40 hours per week salary(I know)) ",

    "text": "This is just a vent post cus idk what to do or feel at this point. I’ve been working at one of the last running Whiskey Creek steakhouses for the last three years. I am 21 years old and when I first started there where three other cooks all my age with one being the bosses son and kitchen manager. This year I am the last man standing and the only cook with any experience because the boss and his son and other cook left to start their own place. When the new management came in, she brought like 4 of her friends from her old restaurant to help. One of them was a kitchen manager. I was concerned because that was the position I wanted now that I was the only one with experience, so I talked to her about it and she told me that upper management was not allowing us to have a new kitchen manager now that the last one was gone because they don’t want any more the kitchen staff on salary, an that yes she had brought her in to be the kitchen manager but was not able to. \n\nAlarm bells ringing. How is a kitchen supposed to operate without a lead?! Well that’s what we have been doing for the last 6ish months and it’s been hell. Everyone needs my help or knowledge. I’m doing all the training, I have to cut my crew based on labor. consistency and quality are out the window, not to mention the kitchen schedule is always posted late and truck is ordered incorrectly leading to not enough inventory.\n\nNow let’s talk about wage like I said three years now and I just got my first raise with the management shift, and don’t get me wrong I will always be grateful for $18 an hour but when I have not broken 40 hours a week since I started working here it puts me on edge. And that is not an exaggeration. The amount of times I have been cut early because I am getting close to 40 hours is incalculable, it makes me feel like shit when I know the most I can ever make off a paycheck is 1100, and the fact that the servers can make that in two weeks (also not an exaggeration we are one of the busiest restaurants in our town they make bank).\n\nAll of the equipment is half broken it feels like, we haven filtered our fryers since I’ve been here because we don’t have a filter. we’ll boil out and scrub (which I do) weekly. \n\nIdk last night I didn’t start he smoker and wasted like 500 dollars worth of meat and no one was even upset with me. It sounds scuffed but I just want to take pride in my work.\n\nAlso it’s hot as dick, like over 100 air temp",

    "text": "For context, i’ve been running a food pop up for about a year and a half, wood fired pizzas, smash burgers, birria tacos mostly. I’ve built a really good clientele of at least 100 regulars who support me and i’m super grateful, i do private caterings and dinners on the side as well as a part time job in nice italian spot mon-thursday. The owners of the brewery I most frequently pop up to want to buy a food truck and have me run it. Im excited about the opportunity, but want to ask my favorite subreddit to weigh in. Essentially, they would buy it, get it licensed and do the marketing. I would just have to come up with menus, and run the operation. I’m just not sure what to negotiate pay wise, would it make more sense to negotiate for a salary, or a percentage of profits. One thing that kills me is i’ve been the sole owner of my food venture and it feels fucking amazing to make all the money, and i understand that won’t be the case if i go forward with this. Although I get the opportunity to build a brand and name as a local chef with no investment. Have any of you been in a similar position? If so any advice or guidance would be really helpful. Right now i’m making probably 75k with my part time job and weekend pop ups, but i’m working a ton and i’m all over the place these days, would like to just focus on one thing. ",

I know my store is struggling. I am pretty much the only manager. I'm supposed to interview/hire/train, make the schedule, do truck orders, do inventory. Yeah. You get it. The workload of 3 managers is all being placed on me. \n\nAnd it's not just my store. A majority of locations are lacking managers. \n\nI can't do this anymore. My feet hurt. I'm exhausted. I don't have any energy. Physically, mentally, emotionally. I cry in my car sometimes before each shift. \n\nI have a bit of savings. Not a lot. I had a pet emergency 2 weeks ago and that almost wiped me clean. But I can do like 2 weeks without a job. I'm already looking. For anything. But I can't keep doing this. ",

    "text": "I had to put down my cat last tuesday. I had that day off with my BF and we made the decision that it was time. The poor boy was just suffering. Massive dose of barbituates after he was under a general sedative and it was all over. Just peaceful. Poor boy was only 6 but cancer ate him down to the bone. It was one of the worst days of my life.\n\nI called my chef on monday to tell him that i could not come in on tuesday, my day off. Schedules are always subject to change in the industry. Sometimes you just get a shitload of reservations and need more people. I get it. So i called to say that Tuesday, i could not be on call for that reason. He was apologetic of course and said \"you're ok, we got other people. Sorry it came to this. My daughter went through that last year and was broken up about it for months. But are you good for wednesday? because we got a lot of people then and we need your help.\n\nSo i show up wednesday. I was off my game. I was just kind of out of it. Going through the motions, needing more direction as to what i should be doing next than normal. Of course i was, given the day i had yesterday. And then for service, I perform. The exec, who is a good boss but over the hill and just putting in time before he retires to the south, he's laughing it up with the sous who is working cold side. meanwhile me and this other guy - who is the real backbone of the kitchen who makes all the shit happen - are putting up the buffet taco menu we got for that night. He did the steak and beans and marked the tortillas on the grill, while i did the ground beef and chicken and rice. And it was upsetting. We're the two lowest paid guys in the kitchen and we're doing the important part while the highest paid salaried guys did the easy part. and we had 2 other cooks in the kitchen helping them and doing prep for saturday. The backbone guy and I wanted some help. And the foh manager noticed and asked us what was up. And the backbone guy just told her straight up how it was bullshit he gets all this responsibility and none of the pay, and i second it saying \"i don't like how they're running it compared to last year\" when we had a different sous who quit over conditions, and then said \"it's not right and unfair to both of us, but especially to (the backbone guy).\n\nThen it hits me that my cat won't be there to say welcome home and make biscuits against my chest and bicep while i play on my computer and pet him. And i'm also hot as fuck because it was a hot day and i'm in a kitchen, so i go to the freezer and just cry once the buffet is closed because i was at a breaking point. That was the best part of my day, when i came home to him. \n\nThe next day the exec and sous pull me aside and ask what happened and why backbone guy and I had bad attitudes that day. I tell them straight up that the backbone guy and i felt under the gun while you guys and the 2 other cooks were taking it easy on cold side prepping for saturday, and that it was also one of the worst days of my life and that i had to cry in the freezer because of how shitty everything was with me relating to my cat and that i'm sorry i let my personal life affect my work. They understood and things were fine. Backbone guy said to me that i was a better man than him because there was no way he'd be there after something like that. I told him i wouldn't put him in that position because then he'd have been even more in the shit and he's taught me too much for me to do him like that. \n\n  \nAnyway, i wanted to share about the first and only time i've ever had to cry in the walk in because of how shit the day was. Usually i just get mad and go outside and smoke a cig and curse people out in my head. ",

I just have sushi chef and cook experience.

So 62 hours total.\n\nBut he claims that I will only work 52 hours a week because I get 2 hour breaks.... I don't know if I agree with that. I would still count those 2 hour breaks as part of my working hours because I am still going to be at the restaurant. Also something could go wrong and my staff would need me to be on-site. So even during breaks I'm technically still working and on-call.\n\nAnd of course, he said I will have to cover shifts if someone doesn't show up. So sometimes I will work 6 days a week. Obviously I would have to cover for every and any shifts - server, host, cooks, sushi chefs, etc.\n\nWhen I calculate $70K a year for 62 hours a week, it only comes out to be $21.71 per hour.\n\nThoughts?",

    "title": "Just got a job without necessary experience — now I’m overwhelmed and not sure this is what I want",
    "text": "So, I recently landed a job in a fine dining restaurant inside a private club — high-end place, members only, serious stuff, if you’re gonna ask, no, I didn’t lie about my experience I was 100% honest. I’m technically a Demi Chef de Partie, which sounds cool but in reality it’s basically one step above dishwasher since we don’t have commis. That said, the salary is surprisingly good.\n\nHere’s the thing: everyone in the kitchen has been to culinary school and has like 10+ years of experience. I’m the only one with no formal education and barely a year of experience. Despite that, they put me in charge of all the pasta dishes — and I’m working the station alone. No support. They trust me because I show up and get the job done, but honestly, the pressure is insane.\n\nI wish I had the chance to start from the very bottom, doing prep and learning slowly, building a proper foundation. Right now, I’m dealing with high responsibility without the skills to back it up. I still struggle with basic knife work. I make mistakes often and constantly have to ask if I’m doing things right. It’s frustrating and stressful and it makes me feel stupid.\n\nI’m also starting to question if this is even what I want long-term. I respect the hustle and the craft, but I’m not sure I see myself doing this forever. And with everyone around me being formally trained, I wonder if there’s even a real career path for someone like me in this environment.\n\nHas anyone been in a similar position? How and when did you realize this was (or wasn’t) your path? What should I do now?",
