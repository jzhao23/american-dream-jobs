I found out yesterday that their protected status is being revoked and they have two weeks to leave the US. \n\nThese kids are seniors, they all have jobs and are just out here to survive. Now they are forced to go back to Haiti where they said it's not safe for them. I wanted to see them graduate, now they'll never be able to walk across the stage. I've been crying for hours yesterday but there's nothing I can do about it. \n\nAnd it hurts me more that the majority of my schools teachers voted for this (super red state). It's disgusting. \n\nWhat am I supposed to tell the class one they notice our students are missing? We aren't allowed to talk politics really, but I can't lie to them. I'm 22, it's my first year teaching, I never thought I'd have to encounter a situation like this. America needs to do better for our children.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for the support, I think my students need it more than I do but I appreciate it none the less. \n\nSome comments mentioned the idea of setting up a fund. I LOVE the idea, but I'll be honest I have no idea how to put something like that in action. If anyone knows how to create something like that please reach out. Thank you again. ",

Good luck to them, taking over the environment with zero support on the inside.\n\nNo severance offered, which means we’ll have to lawyer up if we want even a chance at getting anything. They also still owe me a bonus from last year, which I’m sure they won’t pay. Just a rant. Companies suck sometimes.\n\nEdit: We’re in EU. And thank you all for your comments, makes me feel less alone. \nAlready got a couple of interviews lined up so moving forward.\n\n\nEdit 2: Seems like the whole thing was a hostile takeover of the company by new management and they wanted to get rid of the IT team that was ‘loyal’ to previous management. We’ll fight to get paid for the next 2-3 months as it was specified in our contracts, and maybe severance as there was no real reason for them to fire us. The MSP is now in charge.Happy to be out.

      "text": "I teach high school in the US, mostly freshmen. As I looked at my class rosters this year, I expected more of the same: mostly unfamiliar names of students coming up from the middle school and the occasional surname I recognized as possible relatives of former students I've had prior. But, this year especially, I saw something I've only seen sparingly in my twenty-some years as an educator. Each of my classes contained three to five students, twelve to fifteen total, whom I had last year. As I witnessed these students' self-discipline, work ethic, motivation, and in some cases, attendance from last year, I knew that they had failed first semester. They did not attend summer school. And, for the first time since I've been around, the number of credit recovery classes was greatly reduced due to budget cuts. So these students had to retake my class for graduation credit. \n\nThen something dawned on me that should should have been apparent prior: _Every single one of those dozen-or-so repeaters were boys._ 100%. Not a single young lady had to retake freshman geography. But about fourteen boys, give or take, did. Fourteen out of fourteen. All boys. The implication to me was apparent: this social crisis among boys is is something we can't afford to ignore any longer.\n\nIf you teach, you likely aren't surprised by this. I'm sure by now you've heard that young men are experiencing somewhat of a crisis in regards to education, workforce readiness, success outcomes, and ultimately, quality of life. Numerous studies and publications have been signaling the alarm for over a decade. I'm unsure of this is a uniquely American phenomenon, or Western, or global (maybe educators outside the US can report on this). The resulting impact on society will reach into everyone's lives, regardless if they have children or not. Crime will certainly increase. The social and political effects have already caused incalculable damage to society and will only increase until we figure this out.\n\nSo, why is this happening? What can we do to reverse it? Both as a society, and through smaller measures as individual educators? What are your thoughts or stories surrounding this phenomenon?\n\nThanks for reading.",

      "title": "Gaslighting a Student (AKA The Best Lesson I Ever Taught)",
      "text": "I have a student, we’ll name him John. For the past few months, John has been the bane of my existence. Talking nonstop, never seated, needs to be redirected constantly, submits almost no work, on his phone constantly, and when confronted about his test performance, blames me for “not teaching that” (spoiler: I did teach that). \n\nThe lesson: Teach John what it’s like to teach John. So that he didn’t fail the quarter, upon the request of his mother (and admin forcing my hand), I gave an extra credit project. At first I wasn’t too happy about this, but I quickly realized it was a wonderful opportunity. I made him present his project to me and a group of other teachers. During this presentation, my colleague was on his phone the whole time. Myself and another colleague talked over John multiple times. The fourth interrupted with “sorry John, I just need to run to the bathroom really quickly,” just to come back in and interrupt with more questions. To his credit, John powered through the presentation. At the end, I turned to him and asked, “How can I give you credit for this when you didn’t mention X, Y, or Z?” (All things he did, in fact, mention.) “You weren’t very clear about X” (There was a whole slide about X.) We went back and forth, with John getting increasingly frustrated defending himself and complaining about how we weren’t a very good audience. He was turning red explaining that if we just *listened* and let him present, we would’ve seen these things. Interesting. After a few minutes, the realization hit. While he didn’t *say* anything, the lightbulb that went off in his head said everything I needed to hear. \n\nOf course, I’ll grade John on the actual work he turned in, not the presentation. (And I did tell him this, I’m not evil.) But, something tells me next quarter will be a lot smoother, for both me and John.  Here’s to hoping. \n\nFOLLOW UP: \nHere’s the long awaited follow up. In hindsight, I probably should’ve waited a little more than a month to update. We’ve had quite a few snow days, so it doesn’t feel like I’ve had a good amount of actual class time to accurately assess. With that being said, I have to give John a good amount of credit. There has been a fair amount of measurable change. He certainly has not become the perfect student overnight, he still interrupts from time to time, and definitely isn’t seated throughout the whole class period. \n\nWhat has changed though, is John’s ability to read the room, show empathy to his teachers, and self correct. Just this week alone, I can’t count the number of times he has started to behave like John, and without me saying anything, self-corrected. He’ll usually do this will a comment like “I’m driving you insane, aren’t I Ms. MagesticAvocado? My bad. I’ll lock in.” After that point, he’s generally been able to do as he says he will. Considering the fact that these interactions used to derail him for an entire block, I’m happy with this result. He hasn’t received a single write up since his presentation for me, and he’s only been late on one assignment, which was eventually completed to the best of his ability.  While we still have work to do, he’d leaps and bounds ahead of where he was when I met him. And I’m optimistic moving forward. My only hope is things stay this way.",

      "text": "Wednesday morning, one of my students came in looking visibly pale. I asked if he was feeling okay, and he told me he had thrown up the night before. Forty minutes later he vomited in the classroom. We sent him home immediately, called the parents. Their response? “He only threw up once, last night. We thought it was just something he ate.”\n\nThe next day, two more students started complaining about stomach aches. Both ended up going home after vomiting.\n\nBy Friday night, it hit me. I spent the night hugging the toilet, completely wrecked. Two full days unable to keep anything down, both ends. And to top it off, now my husband has it too. He’s currently running back and forth between bathroom visits.\n\nAt this point, we’ve got at least 8 kids out, two teachers down, and myself. All because some parents thought “he was fine now.”\n\nThis isn’t just a complaint, it’s a plea: If your child is vomiting, has diarrhea, a fever, or any signs of sickness, please, do not send them to school.\n\nWhat’s worse is… this isn’t the first time. And it won’t be the last. Does this happen to you too? Do you usually catch whatever your students bring in?",

I’ll be testing in to get my license this year as my partner is retiring but we do so much more as a company like full on whole home renovations so I’m not constantly plumbing.   Anyways, contractor was supposed to supply hot water heater but didn’t til after I roughed in all the supply and he originally didn’t want to do a recirc system so instead I ran individual lines to the master, laundry and 1/2 bath that is directly above this water heater. The runs are like 20’ or less ensuring hot water quickly.  He then buys hot water heater with recirc so I ran a return line from the upstairs bath and would’ve prolly just did a single 3/4” line throughout but that is no longer an option. \n\nSo at this point I’m just having fun making a nice custom manifold bc this is where we’re at and he criticizes everything about it. How it’s completely unnecessary and I shouldn’t have done any of that and how if he hires me again he doesn’t want any of that. It’s a waste of time and materials and then he says how crazy my stack is and how it should’ve been done different. How I took up too much room and now the electricians don’t have room for a panel. Mind you there are like 3 other walls that are better options in this same room.  \n\nIn my opinion, if there’s a problem with the water system, this manifold allows you to isolate the problem and gives you time to fix it without shutting down the whole system.  He also criticized me for stubbing out in copper. \n\nHis last plumber stubbed out in pex and ran the supply and drains up through the floor instead of the wall. \n\nI’m definitely not the best plumber but I did most this job on my own as my partner (master plumber) was out of town. \n\nAny constructive criticism from some pros would be helpful. Always trying to improve.  \n\nBtw, we passed our inspections. \n",

We were all super confused because our district? Giving away a car? The same district the starts teachers at $45,000/year??? No way. \n\nSo he does the drawings for the smaller prizes, then comes the “big prize” drawing and this time he mentions it **is** a car. My name gets picked!

I have a child that is way too big for it so it’s not like I could give it to him. But even if I had a toddler, why is the “big prize” meant for teachers for a toddler?!? This is all so weird. \n\n4. I looked up the prices of this remote control car and they go for like $200 on Amazon. Why not just make the prize $200?!? I don’t mean to sound ungrateful, but what is the point in this?! \n\n5.

Bystanders(not sure if the parents or not) stated baby was in the “far right room”. Even tho conditions of structure were defensive, I made entry through front door. I felt I was in there for an eternity.. smoke was full from top to bottom, complete unknown layout of home, couldn’t see a thing. As right hand search was being conducted I felt the crib.. at first I thought the 2 month old baby inside was a doll of how small she was.. I made the grab and made head way to the outside. Engine crew stated I was only inside structure for about 15-20 seconds. Once outside I headed straight for the ambulance with the unresponsive child. Proceeded to initiate care and transport to our ER.. while en route we heard the sweetest, most comforting cry I have ever heard in my life, she was starting to breathe on her own… \n\nGot word back from ER that baby is doing good and it felt so good to hear.

I do all of this from my computer to save time.\n\nAs soon as he signed in, I said, \"Let's give your profile a moment to load and I'll show you a few things in our environment.\"  \nBefore I could continue, he cut me off in a somewhat arrogant tone with, \"Umm, I'm Gen Z. I know how to use computers.\"\n\nI replied, \"Of course. I just need to show you a few things specific to our environment.  Do you know what a phishing email is?\"\n\nHe looked at me like a deer in headlights.  \n\"A what?\"  \n\"A phishing email.\"  \n\"I don't know what that is.\"\n\nNo problem. I gave him a quick rundown on what phishing looks like, how our simulator works, and how to report suspicious emails. He wasn't rude, but he definitely looked at me like I was some out-of-touch boomer trying to mansplain the internet while he sipped his Starbucks Frappuccino. (To be honest though, I do have a grey beard but I'm no where near a boomer's age.  I'm Gen X)\n\nThe funny part is, I could have just handed him the laptop with no explanation. But without that introduction, he almost certainly would have clicked one of the simulated emails in the first few days, which automatically enrolls users in mandatory extended training.  Or even worse, a real threat.  And guess who that reflects on? Us, for \"not informing the user.\"  I have all users sign an inventory sheet that also states we went over a brief phishing explanation so they can't ever say we didn't inform them.\n\nI’m just venting a bit about how people can sometimes come across as assuming or defensive when IT is simply trying to do its job.

      "text": "\nI don’t even know where to begin. I’m still fuming. Today, a patient SPIT ON ME. Not once. Not twice. THREE. DAMN. TIMES. And guess what? He was completely alert and oriented (AOx4). No confusion, no delirium—just entitled, disgusting behavior.\n\nHe came in for abdominal pain and was getting Dilaudid 0.5mg Q2H. Already a generous dose, but apparently, it wasn’t enough for him. As I scanned his next dose, he asked me to “just add another 0.25mg and throw the rest away.” Excuse me?? I told him absolutely not. We don’t alter orders, and we don’t play pharmacy tech on demand.\n\nAnd that’s when he lost it.\n\nFirst, he threw his tray at me. Then, the spitting started. Not one drop, not an accident—he aimed for me. Repeatedly. I didn’t wait. I didn’t argue. I called 911 immediately. Screw hospital security—I’m tired of being told, “It’s part of the job.”\n\nSecurity still showed up, courtesy of my charge nurse, who actually had my back and wanted to make sure I was safe. Meanwhile, my unit director decided this was the perfect time to scold me for “not following protocol.” I couldn’t even respond. I was done. Thankfully, my charge nurse cut in and said, “Nurses do not deserve this kind of disrespect.” And that was the ONLY correct thing said in that room.\n\nThe police arrived and asked if I wanted to press charges. And you bet I said HELL YES.\n\nThis. Needs. To. Stop.\n\nWhy are we expected to tolerate physical assault as part of our job? This isn’t a psych patient in crisis. This isn’t dementia. This was a fully competent adult who knew exactly what he was doing. And yet, if I had reacted in any way other than calling for help, I’d be the one under investigation.\n\nI’m done. If hospitals won’t protect us, we’ll protect ourselves. I hope this patient enjoys his assault charge. Maybe next time, he’ll think twice before treating a nurse like garbage.",

      "text": "I have only been in IT for 10 years, but in those 10 years it has changed dramatically. You used to have tech nerds, who had to act corporate at certain times, leading the way in your IT department. These people grew up liking computers and technology, bringing them into the field. This is probably in the 80s - 2000s. You used to have to learn hands on and get dirty \"Pay your dues\" in the help desk department. It was almost as if you had to like IT/technology as a hobby to get into this field. You had to be curious and not willing to take no for an answer.\n\nNow bosses are no longer tech nerds. Now no one wants to do help desk. No one wants to troubleshoot issues. Users want answers on anything and everything right at that moment by messaging you on Teams. If you don't write back within 15 minutes, you get a 2nd message asking if you saw it. Bosses who have never worked a day in IT think they know IT because their cousin is in IT.\n\nWhat happened to a senior sysadmin helping a junior sysadmin learn something? This is how I learned so much, from my former bosses who took me under their wing. Now every tech thinks they have all the answers without doing any of the work, just ask ChatGPT and even if it's totally wrong, who cares, we gave the user something.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I have been fortunate enough to have a career I like.

So I held her hands and got her to calm down and she told me that she wanted a black team then kept apologizing to me for her request.  I told her I wasn’t offended and I’d do everything I could to get her request met. So I called charge and asked them to get me a black nurse in my room, and I’d switch with her (the surgical tech assigned is black).  The black nurse showed up, and my patient as so relieved. Great, I thought it was over, but no.  The charge nurse, a white woman, told me I should have told her that wasn’t possible and she was gonna speak with our manager about what I did.  Great.  I get called into my managers office, where my manager, a black woman, told me I did nothing wrong, but she had to talk to me because the charge nurse pitched a fit about what I did.  \nI’m a white woman, so I don’t understand why my black patient was scared, but I respected it, and I did what I could to make her feel safe.  \nHer surgeon found me later and thanked me for what I did.

Today was a shit show in every sense of the word. I got floated off my regular unit to cover a different floor, and everything went downhill from the second I walked in.\n\nI got report from the day shift tech, ( NO mention of this dog.) As soon as I entered the patient’s room, I noticed a medium sized dog on the floor, probably around 45-50 pounds lying on a pissy wet blanket. It had a bright red vest that said “service dog,” but it was immediately so obvious this dog was not trained. Not even close. The room smelled like straight piss. Sure enough, there were puddles near the bed and shit smeared on the tile. The patient’s family made no effort to clean it up before leaving. They just left it there like it was our responsibility.\n\nI have worked with real service animals before. They are calm, disciplined, and well behaved. This dog was the exact opposite. It barked constantly, growled if anyone came near the patient, and when I bent down to grab wipes to clean the patient after a bowel movement, the dog lunged at me. I was not even close to it. Out of nowhere it snapped and bit my hand, hard. I started bleeding immediately. Blood was dripping onto the floor. I cant believe this mother fucker bit me! \n\nThen the dog switched targets. It began jumping at my charge nurse and attacking her legs. It latched onto her calves and ankles while she tried to shield herself We were screaming for help. In pure panic, we slammed the code blue button on the wall not because the patient coded but because we were under attack and someone’s ass in this room NOW. \n\nI ended up physically sitting on the dog’s back just to keep it from doing more harm until someone could come help. Meanwhile, the owner, lying in the bed like nothing was happening, just kept repeating, “He would not hurt a fly!” Over and over. While the dog was literally covered in my blood and trying to bite through my charge nurse’s scrubs. Like he just attacked us dumbass. \n\nSecurity arrived, then police and animal control. It was absolute chaos. And now, because of the bite, We have to go through rabies precautions. This should have never happened. That dog was dangerous! The situation was preventable.\nNow the owner is talking about a lawsuit… LMAO\n\nThrowing a vest on a pet does not make it a service animal. It puts patients and staff in danger. We need real policies and enforcement now before someone ends up seriously injured or worse than what we have. \n\nFUCK YOU if you slap a service animal badge on your house pet with no real training. \n\nHonestly Im pressing charges because wtf .

      "text": "I'm honestly amazed this even needs to be said but if you're currently in a stable, low-drama, job especially outside of FAANG, just stay put because the grass that looks greener right now might actually be hiding a sinkhole\n\nLet me tell you about my buddy. Until a few months ago, he had a job as a software engineer at an insurance company. The benefits were fantastic.. he would work 10-20 hours a week at most, work was very chill and relaxing. His coworkers and management were nice and welcoming, and the company was very stable and recession proof. He also only had to go into the office once a week. He had time to go to the gym, spend time with family, and even work on side projects if he felt like it\n\nBut then he got tempted by the FAANG name and the idea of a shiny new title and what looked like better pay and more exciting projects, so he made the jump, thinking he was leveling up, thinking he was finally joining the big leagues\n\nFrom day one it was a completely different world, the job was fully on-site so he was back to commuting every day, the hours were brutal, and even though nobody said it out loud there was a very clear expectation to be constantly online, constantly responsive, and always pushing for more\n\nHe went from having quiet mornings and freedom to structure his day to 8 a.m. standups, nonstop back-to-back meetings, toxic coworkers who acted like they were in some competition for who could look the busiest, and managers who micromanaged every last detail while pretending to be laid-back\n\nHe was putting in 50 to 60 hours a week just trying to stay afloat and it was draining the life out of him, but he kept telling himself it was worth it for the resume boost and the name recognition and then just three months in, he got the layoff email\n\nNo warning, no internal transfer, no fallback plan, just a cold goodbye and a severance package, and now he’s sitting at home unemployed in a terrible market, completely burned out, regretting ever leaving that insurance job where people actually treated each other like human beings\n\nAnd the worst part is I watched him change during those months, it was like the light in him dimmed a little every week, he started looking tired all the time, less present, shorter on the phone, always distracted, talking about how he felt like he was constantly behind, constantly proving himself to people who didn’t even know his name\n\nHe used to be one of the most relaxed, easygoing guys I knew, always down for a beer or a pickup game or just to chill and talk about life, but during those months it felt like he aged five years, and when he finally called me after the layoff it wasn’t just that he lost the job, it was like he’d lost a piece of himself in the process\n\nTo make it worse, his old role was already filled, and it’s not like you can just snap your fingers and go back, that bridge is gone, and now he’s in this weird limbo where he’s applying like crazy but everything is frozen or competitive or worse, fake listings meant to fish for resumes\n\nI’ve seen this happen to more than one person lately and I’m telling you, if you’re in a solid job right now with decent pay, decent hours, and a company that isn’t on fire, you don’t need to chase the dream of some big tech title especially not in a market like this\n\nRight now, surviving and keeping your sanity is the real win, and that “boring” job might be the safest bet you’ve got\n\nBe careful out there",

I’m running to replace Dick Durbin in the Senate and fight against Donald Trump.\n\nI’m not a politician. I’m an IBEW Local 134 electrician and I’m frustrated with our representation in Congress. We need more working class members in Congress. There are no active union members in the Senate, and we all know the unions are the backbone of the middle class. We have more than the 5000 signatures to get on the ballot for U.S. Senate. The time is now.\n\n---\n\n* 🦺 CHICAGO, ILLINOIS — Formerly known as Wesley Red—educator, astronomer, and electrician — but certainly not a politician.  \nAn active speaker and community organizer, Chicago Federation of Labor delegate, and Electrical Workers Minority Caucus member who frequently donates his Saturdays giving back to the community through volunteer electrical work, church engagement, and food pantry service. He’s no stranger to the neighborhood!\\*\n\n[Donate on ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jumpforsenate)\n\n---\n\n### 🔑 Top Policies\n\n**The Billionaire’s Bill**  \n1950’s era 92% top tax bracket after first $10 million in income.  \n5% wealth tax on billionaires. 💰\n\n**The Pink Tax**  \nWomen will no longer have to pay a tax just for being born with ovaries. That includes increased prices on razors and deodorant, but also on the hidden costs of pregnancy, childbirth, and more. 🎀\n\n**Teachers and Farmers Bill**  \nSets minimum wage for farm workers and teachers.  \nCreates subsidies for small farmers to compete with corporations and grants for teacher education. 👩🏾‍🌾\n\n---\n\n### ❓ FAQ\n\n**Q: What moment in your life made you realize that regular working-class people like you needed to be in the Senate?**\n\n **A:** The day I should’ve died.\n\nAnother apprentice and I were told to work on a switchgear live, something that even master electricians should not do, when his screwdriver created a path. BANG! The 500 gauge wire exploded with a flash, but shell shock insured I didn’t hear a thing. We were both knocked back and scurried to the opposite wall of the tight, rectangular electrical closet. BA-BANG!! Two more explosions and we quickly realized the breakers were not going to trip and cut power to these wires. We dashed into the even tinier electrical room offset from this one to gather our bearings. Mere seconds later, smoke began to billow in near the ceiling as flaming cardboard embers wafted in. The wires continued to discharge just outside. We had to go. We glanced at each other and knew words were unnecessary. We dashed past the switchgear to make it to the basement hallway and he got clipped by an explosion on his way through. He fell with a Ute and I jumped over him, hoping he would get up and get out. I dashed down the hall to a distance I felt safe, and looked back. He wasn’t behind me! I had no choice, I went back to the closet, yelled his name 2-3-4 times! No answer! The flames started pushing me back and I had to retreat upstairs to where the rest of the construction workers were. I yelled for everyone to leave the building NOW and reprimanded my foreman for putting two APPRENTICES in a situation like that. My partner showed up, I hugged him, and we got out of there. The owner of the electrical contractor called me later that day threatening me with counter-suits if I attempted legal action against him. I called him cold and heartless because the first thing he had to say to his employee that almost just died was a threat. I then said I didn’t plan on suing and he laid me off. He was cold and calculating. He had me replaced by the next day.\n\n**This is a microcosm of the power corporations have over individuals and over our legislation. It feels to most of us that we don’t have any power over what happens in Congress. It’s time to change that.**\n\n---\n\n**Q: You’re an engineer, a union member, a husband—why risk it all to run for office now?**  \n**A:** We are out of time. Our country is $35 Trillion in debt and Trump’s stacked Congress is cutting Medicaid and still running a deficit to give his billionaire friends even greater tax breaks, making his expiring obscene 2017 tax breaks permanent.\n\nThe risk is not in running to save our country. The risk is in doing nothing.\n\n---\n\n**Q: Your platform leads with bold policies: taxing billionaires, empowering teachers and farmers, ending the Pink Tax. Why these issues specifically?**  \n**A:** Women are treated as second class citizens in our country, the greatest country in the world. No more.\n\nTeachers and farmers are the most important, most under-appreciated people in our country. Teachers raise our children and farmers feed the world. It’s time they get the respect they deserve.\n\nBillionaires have been eroding our middle class for half a century. Thanks to them, we spend a trillion dollars every year *servicing* our debt, let alone ever paying it off. It’s time they chipped in.\n\n---\n\n**Q: You’ve never held elected office. What do you bring to the Senate that seasoned politicians don’t?**  \n**A:** I was raised in a house that struggled to keep the heat on in the winter. My mom ALWAYS went without so that we could have. I worked HARD to get my degree in physics and to earn my spot in the IBEW.\n\n98% of senators have never been working class. You ask what I bring to the Senate?\n\n**Grit.**\n\nSome would say running without money or connections is a long shot. I say running on a platform that steals from your constituents is the real long shot. Running on a platform of “not rocking the boat” or “waiting your turn” are far more dangerous to your political career and to the people you represent.\n\n---\n\n**Q: If elected, how will voters know you stayed true to the same Jump Shepherd who started with nothing but a vision and a voice?**  \n**A:** You will see it every day in my actions. There will be no question, and in fact, others will be inspired by my passion to answer the call to serve.\n\n---\n\n### 🔗 Links\n\n🌐 [Website](https://www.jump4senate.com)  \n💳 [Donate on ActBlue](https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jumpforsenate)  \n🎥 [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@jumpforsenate?_t=ZT-8yb78hsUvde&amp;_r=1)  \n📝 [Threads](https://www.threads.com/@jumpforsenate)  \n📚 [More Links](https://www.atom.bio/jumpforsenate)\n\n---\n\n**It’s not Red vs. Blue, it’s Oligarchs vs. You 🫵🏽**\n\n&gt;It’s been a lot of fun talking to everyone, this is our town hall.

He will never fly with me nor with anyone else in my flight school, possibly in all of Canada as well.**\n\nApologies for the click-baity title but I couldn't think of a better one. \n\nYesterday I was flying a routine circuit with a student I’d been working with for a few weeks, one who had made it fairly clear through attitude and body language that I wasn’t his favorite instructor. Still, I approached every lesson with the same professionalism, hoping to build trust through consistency and safety.\n\nWe were on the downwind leg for the runway as usual, abeam the numbers, just beginning to discuss the pre-landing checklist just like we did before many times in preparation for his solo flight. I was mid-sentence about configuring for landing when I noticed his hand abruptly go for the mixture and said \"I'd like to see you recover from this!\" and before I could react, he pulled it all the way out.\n\nThe engine sputtered instantly. I took control immediately and pushed the mixture back in while simultaneously verifying throttle and carb heat. The engine caught again, thankfully without issue. I stayed calm, kept the aircraft flying, and executed a quick approach to land. \n\nI asked him, calmly but firmly, “Why did you pull the mixture?”\n\nHe shrugged and muttered something about “wanting to see what would happen.” I knew better it wasn’t curiosity; it was deliberate! \n\nAfter we landed and taxied back, and I quickly got out of the airplane and fast walked to our chief pilot's office. A colleague met me halfway because he saw us having engine issues, I briefly explained what happened and he confronted the student. Obviously he denied everything. \n\nAfter we all cooled down, the student, our CFI, my colleague and I sat down in his office and while at first he denied everything, it didn't take long to confess that he did do it on purpose because he was tired of being instructed what do to, and I kid you not, especially from a woman. \n\nHe was promptly dismissed from the school and flagged as well. Never in my life would I have though something like this happen. I'm OK now and fortunately the weather is awful today and will be for tomorrow as well so it will give me a chance to decompress and regroup. I'm just venting a bit here because I know most of you will understand. \n\n**Edit: Thank you for all of your responses. I've read through all of them and I am considering my options. Right now, I'm OK and at peace of what happened. The aforementioned student has been expelled from our flight school and new safety measures are in place. For now, a report has been made to CADORS. Our CFI and owner told me to take a couple of weeks off but I think one week it'll be enough. Thanks again for your comments, I'll take this as an experience and will move forward on it.**",

Like the title says, I walked and they closed.\n\nMother’s Day week, I worked 106 hours and slept there once. Only paid for 50, since I was on salary, which amounted to $404 in 2022. That in itself is some shit, but I wouldn’t have left over it. Day after Mother’s Day, the owner tells me I’m not doing enough for the company. I was flabbergasted and sat with it all day.\n\nThe next morning, like 7am, I was out back with the executive chef smoking a couple cigarettes before putting together a catering and it just hit me like a ton of bricks, I’m not doing this anymore.\n\nI looked at the executive chef and exact words said “it’s been real man, I’m going home”. He laughed and then looked at me all concerned like really? “Yeah dude I’m for real, I’m sorry, but I’m out. It’s been a long ass week, it’s been a long ass day (remember it was like 7am I just got there), it’s been real dawg, I’m leaving.”\n\nHe went upstairs without a word, I wrote burn baby burn on the dumpster, and then got 2 trash bags full of all of the equipment I brought in from home for them, I stuffed 2 beers in my pocket, nodded to the EC and drove off.\n\nYou bet your ass that wasn’t even close to the first straw. I talked to one of my old employees after they closed and he said after I left it was complete mayhem, they couldn’t keep staff, cleaning went undone, they couldn’t find another lunatic to fill the role of sous there obviously, the EC got burned to the ground (hate that for him), hard drugs spread like a wildfire, food quality dropped massively, they eventually stopped getting their biggest catering customers and that bitch closed. For reference, our local food magazine voted us best restaurant of the previous year (my town is only 40k population). Lo and behold, I leave and they’re wiped off the map. Smiling as I type this. I’m not saying I’m the reason they were open, I’m not that arrogant, but I was the glue that held that kitchen together. Who didn’t do enough for your company? You fucking cunt, eat shit.\n\nA short victory story for under appreciated chefs everywhere. ",

People avoid you. Your PRs sit in review hell. You get excluded from decisions. You end up working 2x harder for half the impact.\n\n**The counterintuitive solution: Embrace strategic calm.**\n\nI started doing less. I stopped panic-working. I took actual lunch breaks.

      "text": "It all starts at 10pm Saturday night. They want ALL servers, and I do mean ALL turned off in our datacenter. \n\nApparently, this extremely forward-thinking company who's entire job is helping protect in the cyber arena didn't have the foresight to make our datacenter unable to move to some alternative power source. \n\nSo when we were told by the building team we lease from they have to turn off the power to make a change to the building, we were told to turn off all the servers. \n\n40+ system admins/dba's/app devs will all be here shortly to start this. \n\nHow will it turn out? Who even knows. My guess is the shutdown will be just fine, its the startup on Sunday that will be the interesting part. \n\nAm I venting? Kinda. \n\nAm I commiserating? Kinda. \n\nAm I just telling this story starting before it starts happening? Yeah that mostly. \nMore I am just telling the story before it happens. \n\nShould be fun, and maybe flawless execution will happen tonight and tomorrow, and I can laugh at this post when I stumble across it again sometime in the future.\n\nEDIT 1(Sat 11PM): We are seeing weird issues on shutdown of esxi hosted VMs where the guest shutdown isn't working correctly, and the host hangs in a weird state. Or we are finding the VM is already shutdown but none of us (the ones who should shut it down) did it. \n\nEDIT 2(Sun 3AM): I left at 3AM, a few more were still back, but they were thinking 10 more mins and they would leave too. But the shutdown was strange enough, we shall see how startup goes. \n\nEDIT 3(Sun 8AM): Up and ready for when I get the phone call to come on in and get things running again. While I enjoy these espresso shots at my local Starbies, a few answers for a lot of the common things in the comments:\n\n* Thank you everyone for your support, I figured this would be intresting to post, I didn't expect this much support, you all are very kind\n\n* We do have UPS and even a diesel generator onsite, but we were told from much higher up \"Not an option, turn it all off\". This job is actually very good, but also has plenty of bureaucracy and red tape. So at some point, even if you disagree that is how it has to be handled, you show up Saturday night to shut it down anyway. \n\n* 40+ is very likely too many people, but again, bureaucracy and red tape. \n\n* I will provide more updates as I get them. But first we have to get the internet up in the office...\n\nEDIT 4(Sun 10:30AM): Apparently the power up procedures are not going very well in the datacenter, my equipment is unplugged thankfully and we are still standing by for the green light to come in.\n\nEDIT 5(Sun 1:15PM): Greenlight to begin the startup process (I am posting this around 12:15pm as once I go in, no internet for a while). What is also crazy is I was told our datacenter AC stayed on the whole time. Meaning, we have things setup to keep all of that powered, but not the actual equipment, which begs a lot of questions I feel. \n\nEDIT 6 (Sun 7:00PM): Most everyone is still here, there have been hiccups as expected. Even with some of my gear, but not because the procedures are wrong, but things just aren't quite \"right\" lots of T/S trying to find and fix root causes, its feeling like a long night. \n\nEDIT 7 (Sun 8:30PM): This is looking wrapped up. I am still here for a little longer, last guy on the team in case some \"oh crap\" is found, but that looks unlikely. I think we made it. A few network gremlins for sure, and it was almost the fault of DNS, but thankfully it worked eventually, so I can't check \"It was always DNS\" off my bingo card. Spinning drives all came up without issue, and all my stuff took a little bit more massaging to work around the network problems, but came up and has been great since. The great news is I am off tommorow, living that Tue-Fri 10 hours a workday life, so Mondays are a treat. Hopefully the rest of my team feels the same way about their Monday.\n\nEDIT 8 (Tue 11:45AM): Monday was a great day. I was off and got no phone calls, nor did I come in to a bunch of emails that stuff was broken. We are fixing a few things to make the process more bullet proof with our stuff, and then on a much wider scale, tell the bosses, in After Action Reports what should be fixed. I do appreciate all of the help, and my favorite comment and has been passed to my bosses is \n\n\"You all don't have a datacenter, you have a server room\"\n\nThat comment is exactly right. There is no reason we should not be able to do a lot of the suggestions here, A/B power, run the generator, have UPS who's batteries can be pulled out but power stays up, and even more to make this a real data center. \n\nLastly, I sincerely thank all of you who were in here supporting and critiquing things. It was very encouraging, and I can't wait to look back at this post sometime in the future and realize the internet isn't always just a toxic waste dump. Keep fighting the good fight out there y'all!",

      "text": "I’m a professional software engineer, and today something happened that honestly shook me. I watched an AI agent, part of an internally built tool our company is piloting, take in a small Jira ticket. It was the kind of task that would usually take me or a teammate about an hour. Mostly writing a SQL query and making a small change to some backend code.\n\nThe AI read through our codebase, figured out the context, wrote the query, updated the code, created a PR with a clear diff and a well-written description, and pushed it for review. All in just a few minutes.\n\nThis wasn’t boilerplate. It followed our naming conventions, made logical decisions, and even updated a test. One of our senior engineers reviewed the PR and said it looked solid and accurate. They would have done it the same way.\n\nWhat really hit me is that this isn’t some future concept. This AI tool is being gradually rolled out across teams in our org as part of a pilot program. And it’s already producing results like this.\n\nI’ve been following AI developments, but watching it do my job in my codebase made everything feel real in a way headlines never could. It was a ticket I would have knocked out before lunch, and now it’s being done faster and with less effort by a machine.\n\nI’m not saying engineers will be out of jobs tomorrow. But if an AI can already handle these kinds of everyday tickets, we’re looking at serious changes in the near future. Maybe not in years, but in months.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something similar? What are you doing to adapt? How are you thinking about the future of our field?",

At the very least our unit is 50% males and 99% of the time they need assistance with cleaning. \n\nMy unit has bent over backwards to accommodate this nurse to the point where they’ll give another nurse a heavier, less safe assignment or switch assignments mid shift in order to not assign this nurse a male patient. This nurse also won’t respond to codes or patient emergencies if the patient is male because of the risk of seeing them in a state of undress. Not to mention just simple tasks like asking another nurse to help with a cleanup or calling on a buddy to lay eyes on your patient is made more difficult when this nurse has an assignment next to yours.\n\nI have really mixed feelings about it and everyone on my unit seems scared to talk about it and risk coming off as a bigot or insensitive.

I don’t take every project on and not every one works out, but enough do that I can do it more than full time. \n\nLately, though, I have noticed a large increase in projects where they paid a ton of money for an internal software and it does not work well at all. Tons of errors, unreasonably slow, inefficient and taking up a lot of resources, and large security flaws. At first, I thought maybe people just hired bad developers. The bar is pretty low to call yourself a developer or even a software engineer anyways, but I’m seeing the same problems now on multiple projects. \n\nWhen I take on a project on, I always sign an NDA and look at their codebase to look at some upfront issues that I can bring up because, most of the time, the people hiring me aren’t technical and don’t understand what the problem is. This is probably the 5th time now that a lot of the code was obviously AI generated. Comments in the code that were obviously written by AI, algorithms that are inefficient and make no sense, cluttered data structures, inconsistent coding patterns, etc. The overall thing is that, yes it mostly works, but does so terribly to the point where it needs to be fixed. \n\nIt might be a few years before we start to see this on an enterprise scale, but I’m noticing this becoming a serious problem for small businesses and startups, especially when the founders / people are in charge aren’t technical enough to identify this ahead of time.

      "text": "Over the past few weeks, I’ve been dealing with a frustrating issue with our enterprise server infrastructure. Our systems, which host critical applications, databases, and business services, would randomly go offline. There were no crashes, no hardware failures — the servers just disappeared from the network, though they were still running.\n\n\n\nI started troubleshooting the network, diving into our UniFi building bridge configuration, checking for packet loss, and reviewing our firewall settings. Some days, everything worked perfectly. Other days, without warning, the servers would drop offline. It was baffling, and nothing in the logs pointed to an obvious problem.\n\n\n\nThen, I noticed something strange. Every time I was physically present in the server room, the systems would stay online. But as soon as I left, the network would fail. The servers were still up, but they were unreachable.\n\n\n\nAfter further investigation, I discovered something that made me question my entire approach: The UniFi switch was plugged into an outlet controlled by a motion-sensor for the server room lighting. When I was in the room, the sensor kept the lights — and thus the switch — powered. When I left, the lights turned off, cutting the power to the switch, which dropped the network connection.\n\n\n\nI couldn’t believe it. The problem wasn’t with the network at all — it was a power issue, disguised as something much more complicated. Since then, I moved the switch to a dedicated outlet and everything has been smooth sailing.\n\n\n\nSometimes, the simplest explanation is the right one.\n\n(The while room has battery backup power, including the lights. Don’t start ranting about UPSs.)",

      "title": "Rubik's Cube- Manually machined from aluminum, fully functional",
      "text": "Hi everyone, thought I'd share a passion project of mine that I did over this summer. I'm a college student who learned the basics of machining for my manufacturing class, and I thought I'd use my college's makers' space to make something really memorable.\n\nDisclaimer: I didn't create the original design myself- the idea and drawings were adapted from this website: [https://lulabs.net/machining/ss-cube/](https://lulabs.net/machining/ss-cube/)\n\nHowever, I did need to do a substantial amount of adjustment to the original plan to suit my needs. I ended up making it out of aluminum, mostly because, as the website points out, a steel cube is way to heavy to be easily solvable.\n\nMaterials used:\n\n\\-4' of 1\"x1\" square 6061 stock\n\n\\-1' of 3/8\" rod 6061 stock\n\n\\-6 4/40 screws\n\n\\-6 small compression springs, max load of 1-2 pounds\n\nLet's go through the basic process. First up are the \"plans\" I used throughout- they ended up looking pretty insane. The best part of solo projects is that your plans only have to make sense to you. The cube consists of:\n\n\\- a six-sided core with tapped holes.\n\n\\- six stems with one small through hole and one larger blind hole as well as external threads. This stem traps a spring-loaded screw, which presses the whole cube together while allowing it to rotate freely.\n\n\\-six face centers, with curved inside faces and a blind, tapped hole for the stems.\n\n\\-eight corner pieces\n\n\\-twelve edge pieces. The edge and corner pieces have straight cuts as well as circular cuts, which was probably the biggest problem I had to solve.\n\nFirst up, cutting parts to size and squaring them up. This was easily the most tedious part of the whole project- the whole thing is really cool and I'd recommend it to anyone who has the skills, tools, and time, but there's no getting around the fact that squaring up 27 parts really sucks.\n\nNext, the stems. These were unexpectedly difficult- it's really hard to precisely machine a part that's only half an inch long in a lathe designed for parts that are multiple feet long. I also had trouble getting the threads straight, which is part of why I had to redo some of the stems.\n\nThe 7th pictures is of the face centers, after they've been given the circular cut to make the internal curved surface. I ended up using a boring bar for all the circular cuts- it was a little scary running a cutting tool at a 1.5\" diameter and 1750 rpm, but all went well.\n\nThe next two pictures are drilling and tapping holes in order to put together the stem-face center assembly. Again, getting straight threads was a challenge, and probably was the biggest contributor to wonkiness in the final product. Notice the hole on the exposed side of the stems- that's where the end of the 4-40 screw will go through.\n\nThe 10th pictures is of the core- dialing in such a tiny part on a large 4-jaw chuck was extremely frustrating, but it ended up working shockingly well.\n\nNext up, the corners and edges. First, they get rectangular cuts with an endmill. This was where the most material was taken off. To finish them off, the circular cuts with the boring bar. The corners get 3 circular cuts each, and the edges get 4 each.\n\nIn the 13th picture, you can start to see how the cube works mechanically- each edge and corner piece is designed to be able to slide freely past the others while being pressed against them. The face center is able to rotate freely, and the edges and corners are brought along for the ride.\n\nAfter all the parts were \"done\", there was a lengthy amount of finishing. Picture 14 shows the middle of the process, after I had used a file to chamfer the internal edges and remove sharp corners that interfered with turning. At this point, the cube had been fully assembled many times but this was the first time it actually behaved like a rubik's cube.\n\nNext, every external edge needed a chamfer, both to prevent people from cutting themselves, and to make it look more like a professional rubik's cube. I did that with some V blocks and an endmill.\n\nI went back and forth on the final look of the cube- I wanted the fact that it was made out of metal to be front and center, so painting it to look like the real thing was out of the question. Some people suggested anodizing it, but you can't really anodize just one face of a part. So I decided to engrave shapes in each face, and paint those shapes. That way, the cube has familiar colors while also preserving the bare metal look (and being solvable while blindfolded!)\n\nThe trouble with this, though, is that the engraving process I used was very susceptible to mistakes. I just used a ball-tipped endmill and cut about 7 thou deep. This looked great when it was done perfectly, but if any part of the setup wasn't flat, then the engraving in question was too shallow and narrow in some places, and too deep and wide in others. A few of them turned out that way... unfortunate, but not really fixable without making a new part.\n\nThen, finishing. I used a scotch-brite buffing wheel, which was much faster than sandpaper, and allowed me to easily align all the surface finish grains in one direction for extra style. I had to be choosy about which nicks and pits to try to buff out, because the engravings were so shallow that I risked making them look weird by taking off too much material. The freshly buffed cube (assembled and disassembled) are shown in pictures 16 and 17.\n\nLastly, painting. I used acrylic, which actually worked really well- when I got the water-paint ratio right, the surface tension of the water allowed the paint to fill up the slot easily without running over or sloshing around. To protect the paint, I also sprayed the whole thing with a clear coat.\n\nAnd that's it! The finished cube is shown in more detail in the last two pictures. You may be wondering, how well does it work? The answer is, about the same as an official rubik's brand. So totally serviceable, but by no means viable for a speedcuber.\n\nIt took a lot of work (at least 50 hours, probably more than 100), but I had a blast doing it. I know a lot more about machining now than I did a few months ago, and it was a much better use of my summer free time than playing video games and reading books.\n\nEdit: Here's a link to a video of me solving the cube, so you can get a sense of how well it turns.\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/1nsct6a/by\\_popular\\_demand\\_heres\\_a\\_video\\_of\\_me\\_solving\\_the/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Cubers/comments/1nsct6a/by_popular_demand_heres_a_video_of_me_solving_the/)",

Because the type of carpentry I do is pretty far outside of general carpentry they don't have any established habits that conflict with my trade.

After they stripped the paint off a few of them I was able to assess the overall condition and came to the realization that these are too far gone to reuse. This means that I have to replicate 40 of these pieces. \n\nSo today I made a couple of templates and showed my helper how to mark and carve. We were able to discuss the approach together (I am not a woodcarver!), troubleshoot some potential problems, and determine that all we needed to use are pareing chisels, no gouges or carving knives necessary. \n\nThe first one I tried doing myself while they were cleaning up the paint removal area. I made enough mistakes to call it a wash, and to let them know how I did it wrong. \n\nI showed them how to use the template to determine the convex curve, handed them the pareing chisel, and said \"Have at it!\". \n\nIt took them about an hour to do one, with the occasional questions and bit of guidance, and it came out great! Not perfect, there are a few mistakes in the first one, but definitely good enough to install up high. \n\nIf they can get the time down to a half an hour each and stay relatively within the parameters I will call that a job well done. \n\n",

My student opened up the engine restart and forced landing checklists and went through each item line-by-line while I diverted to the nearest airport. We managed to climb slightly before the engine started running rough again, then eventually fully quit. We climbed enough to be within glide range of the airport should we experience complete power loss. By the time landing was assured, the engine had quit completely. We made the runway and had enough momentum to taxi clear of it. My student thought the whole thing was a nasty joke until I called my supervisor.

Smith was declared brain dead. Her family has been by her side every day since, including her young son, who they said still believes his mother is just sleeping. She’s been breathing through machines for more than 90 days,” Newkirk said. “It’s torture for me. I see my daughter breathing, but she’s not there. And her son—I bring him to see her.” \n\n&gt;Newkirk said doctors told the family the baby has fluid on the brain and they're not sure how much fluid. They're concerned about his health.“She’s pregnant with my grandson. But he may be blind, may not be able to walk, may not survive once he’s born,” Newkirk said. \n\n&gt;Under Georgia’s heartbeat law, abortion is banned once cardiac activity is detected — typically around six weeks into pregnancy.  The law includes limited exceptions for rape, incest, or if the mother’s life is in danger. But in Adriana’s case, the law created a legal gray area.\n \n&gt;Because she is brain dead — no longer considered at risk herself — her medical team is legally required to maintain life support until the fetus reaches viability. The family said doctors told them they are not legally allowed to consider other options.\n\nNot mentioned in this article but she was 9 weeks pregnant when she died. Insane to me that apparently the only legal option to turn her into a zombie incubator for 6-7 months. ",

She stared at me blankly and said, \"But we already paid for the equipment. Why are we expensing it again?\"\n\nWhen I mentioned that this is basic GAAP and showed her the journal entries, she asked me to \"walk through it step by step because this seems unnecessarily complicated.\" I spent 30 minutes explaining concepts that are literally covered in Accounting 101.\n\nShe also asked why we can't just expense our new $50K server \"to get the tax write-off this year instead of spreading it out.\" When I explained capitalization thresholds and asset vs. expense classification, she suggested we \"check with the tax guy because this doesn't seem right.\"\n\nThe kicker? She's supposed to be reviewing our financial statements for accuracy before they go to the board next week.\n\nEdit: For context, this is a $15M revenue manufacturing company, not some tiny startup where you might expect less formal accounting.\n\nEdit 2: She also asked yesterday why our cash flow statement \"doesn't match the P&amp;L\" and seemed genuinely confused when I explained that net income isn't the same as cash flow.\n\nI'm honestly questioning how she made it through 20 years in finance without understanding these fundamentals.

      "text": "I'm a preceptor on a busy surgical unit, and I currently have a capstone (senior level) nursing student with me. She has done 7 shifts with me so far. She is doing an online RN program, and has never worked as a CNA. Also has something of a military background, though I don't know the specifics. She told me her plan was to blow straight through school to being an NP and never actually work as an RN. \n\nThe first couple shifts she was late (like 7:30 late and completely missed shift change/report) and also didn't have a stethoscope (!!!). She always asks if she can go get coffee/breakfast during the busiest morning hours of the shift. She had literally NO idea how to do assessments. I mean, none. I had to send her youtube videos to watch to get her up to speed. I have spent the majority of our clinical time showing her mundane CNA level shit...bed changes, transfers, etc. She often is clueless about the meds ordered and why, and seems to know very little about common diagnoses (CHF, PNA, etc).\n\nAs time went on I grew more impatient with her. She came to me for EVERY tiny thing. I started responding to her questions with, \"I don't know. You're the nurse. What do YOU think you should do?\" (not to be mean at all, just to start pushing her with the critical thinking). She never has any good answers, and relies on me to tell her whether she should give someone tylenol. \n\nYesterday I had a ridiculous assignment with 3 extremely heavy pts, plus 2 lighter ones on the other side of the unit. Just out of pure desperation I told her to take the 2 easy ones so I could get the others stabilized quickly. Seemed like things were going well. At 4 pm I finally had time to look at her charting on the other 2. One of her pts had a BP of 201/112 in the morning. I asked her why she hadn't told me this...?!? \"Well I treated it. I gave him 10 mg of PO lisinopril (scheduled)\". His next recorded BP at noon was 197/110. She never told me any of this, nor had ANY concern when I became alarmed over it. Granted, it was partially my fault for trusting a student and not monitoring her, but again I was DROWNING with the other 3 pts. Shouldn't a senior level nursing student at least be able to identify abnormal VS?!? \n\nSo...her instructor has told me it is 100% based on my review of her if she passes or fails. I feel she is light years away from being ready to practice as an RN. And again, she seems to not care a ton about her clinicals as she is planning \"to just be an NP anyway\". \n\nI hate to fail someone who has invested the time, money, and effort...but holy shit. I don't want it on my conscience either that I promoted someone who absolutely isn't ready. What should I do?!??",

      "text": "I used to think landing a job at a big tech company would be the peak of my career. Everyone made it sound like once you got in, your life was set. Prestige, money, smart people, meaningful work. I bought into the whole thing. I worked my ass off to get there. Leetcode, system design prep, referrals, rejection after rejection. And when I finally got the offer, I remember feeling like I had won the lottery.\n\nThat feeling didn’t last long.\n\nWhat I stepped into was one of the most toxic, mentally draining environments I’ve ever experienced. It didn’t happen all at once. It crept in. The first few weeks were exciting, but then the cracks started to show. The pressure was insane. The deadlines were borderline delusional. There was this unspoken expectation to be available at all times. Messages late at night. Work bleeding into weekends. No one ever said it out loud, but if you wanted to be seen as serious, as someone who \"got it,\" you had to sacrifice everything else.\n\nThe culture was a constant performance. I couldn’t just do my job. I had to sell it. Everything I worked on needed a narrative. Every project had to be spun into something that could fit neatly into a promotion packet or a perf review. I wasn’t building software. I was building a case to not be forgotten. Because every quarter, someone got labeled as underperforming. It didn’t always make sense who it was. Sometimes it was the quietest person on the team. Sometimes it was someone who just had the wrong skip manager. Everyone smiled in meetings but no one felt safe.\n\nThe politics were unbearable. Influence mattered more than clarity. Visibility mattered more than functionality. Everything had to be socialized in just the right way to just the right people. One wrong Slack message or a poorly timed piece of feedback could nuke months of work. And if you didn’t know how to play the game, it didn’t matter how smart or hardworking you were. You were dead in the water.\n\nWork-life balance was a joke. I was constantly anxious, constantly behind, constantly checking messages like something was going to blow up if I missed a ping. I stopped sleeping properly. I stopped seeing friends. I stopped caring about things I used to love. My weekends were spent recovering from the week and bracing for the next one. And the whole time I kept telling myself it was temporary. That it would get better. That if I just made it to the next level, it would all be worth it.\n\nBut it never got better. The pressure just got worse. The bar kept moving. The layoffs started. The reorganizations. The endless leadership changes. Half my team vanished in one cycle. I remember joining a Zoom call one morning and realizing I didn’t even know who my manager reported to anymore. People were disappearing mid-project. Morale was a punchline. Everyone was scared but pretending they weren’t. Everyone was tired but still smiling in team standups. I started to feel like I was losing my grip.\n\nWhen I finally left, I didn’t feel free. I felt broken. It took months before I stopped checking my calendar every morning out of reflex. I still have dreams about unfinished sprints and last-minute roadmap changes. I still flinch when I see a Slack notification.\n\nPeople glamorize these jobs because of the compensation and the brand names. But no one talks about the cost. I gave that place everything and it chewed through me like I was nothing. Just another seat to fill. Just another cog in the machine. I left with more money, sure.

      "title": "UPDATE: Today is fucked",
      "text": "Thought I’d pass on an update and a couple stupid things I did to my last post. If you saw it, you probably laughed at my misfortune. If you didn’t, knock yourself out: \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Plumbing/s/xSUy7CvbBk\n\nPlumbing was completed today. Took me two hours. 25’ of pipe that I somehow maneuvered into the existing hvac/plumbing/framing in 5’ increments. \n\nLike a true fucking man, I inhaled some glue, rubbed some primer in my wounds, told the kids to treat the wife well, and put on my mask. Because like many of you said, it smelled like shit. \n\nFYI, primer in your armpit feels weird. I don’t know how it dripped there but I was a contortionist on that ladder. I would try it again, but it’s not really that great. \n\nNow for the details:\n\nThere was a a ton of grease on the sides and top of the pipe. My guess is someone had better luck with a small snake in the past then I did and water has been traveling that path for the last 3.5 years. I obviously fucked that up with draino. \n\nNow it’s time to laugh at my misfortune. I forgot to mention that before I got the draino and snake, I was dumping near boiling water down the drain, waiting a minute, and sucking it up with a shot vac. I repeated that a dozen times until I heard gurgling. In my excitement, I stuck my head down there expecting it to drain. Instead I was greeted with an explosion of hot water and grease to my face and thighs. \n\nI’m fine, I once tried to find a propane leak with a lighter. 2nd degree burns on my face so my skin has some resilience. Yea, I’m an idiot and yea, I was drunk. \n\nI also tried plunging the sink and blew out the garbage disposal. I really have no idea what the fuck I did, but I somehow manhandled that thing to a constant leak. So there went a $120. I also tried an air compressor down the cleanout, but that didn’t accomplish much of anything. Which sucked cause I thought it was a brilliant idea. \n\nFor those of you that said raccoon shit was in the ceiling, not dog shit, you’re probably right. I found a hole in the OSB that is currently covered by siding. Of course there’s no house wrap there, either. Someone before me obviously was bedding down with those fuckers. Lucky for me, my dogs tree em and they rarely come around. \n\nBecause I’m not a fucking electrician, I swept up my mess when I was done. I’m also not a plumber, so I busted a pipe trying to snake a drain. Take that for what you will. \n\nAnyways, don’t be an idiot. Don’t run a snake for 4 hours. Maybe stay away from draino. And if you have a shot vac, air compressor, a 25’ snake, a 50’ snake, and some boiling water all in the kitchen- maybe stop and call a plumber\n\nAnd for those of you that asked about the grow tents, my wife’s weed is fine. Which is good, otherwise I would probably be in the middle of a divorce writing this. ",

      "text": "Made a huge jump in aircraft ownership as of yesterday. I’m now the owner/operator of a 1979 Cessna 340A. \n\nAs I continue to build flight time and multi time, we were looking to upgrade to an aircraft that my mother and sister (both of whom are not very fond of flying) would feel more comfortable in, as well as something that had a good chunk of useful load with full fuel. The 2004 Turbo 182T that we had was fine for just me, and it got me through my CSEL and across the country, but it wasn’t something the rest of my family was comfortable flying in, nor did it even have the useful load to support them with any significant amount of fuel.\n\nFast-forward to mid-2025, and we started exploring various other options, including single engine turboprops like the Meridian, Malibu Jetprop, or 210 Silver Eagle. We decided we eventually wanted something with two engines for added safety when flying over the Rockies, the Sierra Nevadas, and the Cascades, as well as pressurization and known icing capability. King Airs were out of our price range and operating cost, as were the larger piston twins like the Cessna 421. Nor did we even need something with that much excess capacity.\n\nWe then looked at the Cessna 414, Baron 58P, and the Cessna 340A. 414 was great, but again, still a bit much access capacity that I know I would never use, plus an expensive repetitive wing spar AD. The P-Baron was also cool, but cramped (and the airframes and wings are life-limited to 10,000 hours). Eventually, we decided the 340A would be perfect. \n\nAfter a lot of searching, we ended up finding an opportunity with a fantastically well-kept 1979 340A. Just over 6000TT on the airframe, RAM VI 335hp engines and MT 4-blade composite props with &lt;300 hours on both, vortex generators, a refurbished interior, new deicing boots, and a full glass panel - Dual G600TXI’s, GTN 750NXi/GNS 430 backup, GFC600 autopilot with rudder bias, GI 275 standby attitude indicator, BFG Stormscope, Keith electric air conditioning, and a new set of CiES fuel senders. This aircraft was also selling with a fresh annual.\n\nAs to be expected from someone who is hovering at just under 600TT and 28 multi, insurance is, for the time being, eye-wateringly, *soul-crushingly* expensive. I also have to do 50 dual with a qualified instructor. However, we all knew going into it that twins are money pits. \n\nI absolutely love how this aircraft flies, and managing the fuel system as well as the temperamental TSIO-520-NBs isn’t that bad at all once you get used to it. My instructor is very impressed with my ability to handle the plane thus far, and he’s looking forward to completing my insurance requirements. I’m making sure to be a complete sponge and soak up as much knowledge as I can about operating this aircraft, because I absolutely do not want to become a statistic.",

      "text": "[DesertDogggg](https://www.reddit.com/user/DesertDogggg/)'s post, \"[Umm, I'm Gen Z. I know how to use computers](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ph0gmo/umm_im_gen_z_i_know_how_to_use_computers)\" reminded me of a user I briefly knew, way back in the day.\n\nThis was about 15 years ago, when our hotel's internet pipe was a bonded T1, IIRC.  4.5Mb total.  We also used a corporate Exchange server, so all 110 hotels in North America went back to those servers.\n\nAnyway, we had this brand new sales admin who was kind of a smarmy know-it-all.  When I onboarded her, she gave me this attitude that she already knew it all and didn't need me telling her the basics.  Okay, fair enough.  Less work for me, so I just gave her her logon, told her the basics about our environment and left her alone.\n\nAbout four hours later, I get a call from the corporate Exchange admin, telling me that this lady had sent an email with a 25Mb file attachment.  On top of that, she had sent it to everyone in the sales department.  Back then, this was enough to take down email for every one of those 110 hotels.  Thousands of users.  He killed the email and service was restored, but suggested I talk to her.  Yep, agreed.\n\nSo I stop by her desk and let her know that we don't have enough bandwidth to support sending that kind of attachment and, btw, we do have a file server and you really should save that file in the sales department's folder.  I had told her about the file server during onboarding, but she obviously didn't listen.  She kinda blow me off but seemed to at least understand me, so I left it alone, although I did tell the sales &amp; marketing director why their email was down for an hour.  Nothing malicious; she had asked because she was understandably concerned.\n\nNext day, I get another call from the Exchange admin.  Same situation, but with a 37Mb attachment this time.  So I go up there and reiterate my point, and she tells me, \"my husband works in IT and he's way smarter than you!  He makes double what you'd making.\"  Ohhh kay... I don't know how/why that's relevant, but I don't rise to the bait and I don't reply.  I do, however, tell the sales &amp; marketing director why their email has been down twice in two days and who's responsible.\n\nThird day, I get a call from the sales &amp; marketing director.  The entire sales &amp; marketing departmental folder is completely gone.  Luckily, I had shadow copy enabled, so it was a pretty quick fix, but the director asks me how this happened?  Well, looking at the logs, it's my favorite sales admin.  I let the director know.\n\nFourth day, I get another call from the sales &amp; marketing director.  The entire sales &amp; marketing folder is completely gone yet again.  Restored again, told her who was responsible.\n\nFast forward about 15 minutes or so and I get a call from my boss to disable the admin's account as she's been fired.\n\nKinda had to laugh at that.\n\nEDIT: Since it seems to be coming up a lot, I want to add that a.) I wasn't the Exchange admin, b.) this was the hotel industry 15+ years ago, when all you needed to get an IT job was a pulse and knowledge of how to turn a computer on, and c.) neither the Exchange admin nor I had any idea what a message size limit was.  Or maybe he did and just chose to disable it.  As mentioned in point a, I wasn't the Exchange guy.",

While doing this, I noticed a Delta captain in uniform come in and sit down with his drink at a table near mine. Well, here I am filling out applications, might as well get some hiring news straight from the horse's mouth, so I go over and start talking to him. I ask if he knows if Delta is hiring and I tell him that I'm a regional airline pilot. He doesn't seem to hear that last bit, and tells me that if I study hard and apply myself that I, too, can be an airline pilot like him. Oooookay, he's a lil deaf, so I tell him that, no, I'm already a pilot, I fly for Air Wisconsin. He kinda gives me a blank look, like he's never heard of air wisk*yahn*sin, and then just says that yeah, if I'm willing to fly international that I'll be hired quickly because nobody else wants to do it because their girlfriends get jealous. This surprised me, not just because of the unbidden and weird advice for my love life but also that Delta was easy to get into. I said wow, I sure will sir! He goes on to mention that flying charter for the vikings was interesting but they are rude to the other passengers, which should have been another warning sign because an NFL team sure as shit doesn't fly with other passengers. I finally twig to something being wrong when he says \"flying international is interesting when they refuel you in flight.\"\n\n\"...Delta refuels in flight?\"\n\n\"Yeah, the military does it all the time...\"\n\n\"I knew that, but you're saying that DELTA airlines refuels its international flights MIDAIR?\"\n\n\"Oh yeah, they do for the long flights. Especially for countries that don't really get along with the U.S.\"\n\nAt this point I'm taking a good look at his uniform. He has a pilot shirt, I recognize the brand, his epaulets seem kosher, he's wearing a lanyard with what looks like a Delta card in it, he's even got a little gold Delta pin in his tie. HOWEVER, I just now realize that his wings above his left pocket are THE PLASTIC WINGS YOU HAND OUT TO KIDS ON AN AIRPLANE. And then I notice things like 'wait a minute, I'm nowhere near the airport, why is this guy wearing his uniform?' and 'he's in uniform but where's his submarine commander hat and pea coat, its freezing out there'. And then I realize holy shit, this guy is LARPING AS AN AIRLINE PILOT IN HIS LOCAL COFFEE JOINT. We've got a case of stolen airline valor down at caribou and its not the airport caribous so there isn't a discount or anything, this guy is just doing his thing and I fell for it for like three whole minutes.",

      "title": "Data Science Has Become a Pseudo-Science",
      "text": "I’ve been working in data science for the last ten years, both in industry and academia, having pursued a master’s and PhD in Europe. My experience in the industry, overall, has been very positive. I’ve had the opportunity to work with brilliant people on exciting, high-impact projects. Of course, there were the usual high-stress situations, nonsense PowerPoints, and impossible deadlines, but the work largely felt meaningful.\n\nHowever, over the past two years or so, it feels like the field has taken a sharp turn. Just yesterday, I attended a technical presentation from the analytics team. The project aimed to identify anomalies in a dataset composed of multiple time series, each containing a clear inflection point. The team’s hypothesis was that these trajectories might indicate entities engaged in some sort of fraud.\n\nThe team claimed to have solved the task using “generative AI”. They didn’t go into methodological details but presented results that, according to them, were amazing. Curious, nespecially since the project was heading toward deployment, i asked about validation, performance metrics, or baseline comparisons. None were presented.\n\nLater, I found out that “generative AI” meant asking ChatGPT to generate a code. The code simply computed the mean of each series before and after the inflection point, then calculated the z-score of the difference. No model evaluation. No metrics. No baselines. Absolutely no model criticism. Just a naive approach, packaged and executed very, very quickly under the label of generative AI.\n\nThe moment I understood the proposed solution, my immediate thought was \"I need to get as far away from this company as possible\". I share this anecdote because it summarizes much of what I’ve witnessed in the field over the past two years. It feels like data science is drifting toward a kind of pseudo-science where we consult a black-box oracle for answers, and questioning its outputs is treated as anti-innovation, while no one really understand how the outputs were generated.\n\nAfter several experiences like this, I’m seriously considering focusing on academia. Working on projects like these is eroding any hope I have in the field. I know this won’t work and yet, the label generative AI seems to make it unquestionable. So I came here to ask if is this experience shared among other DSs?\n\n",

I am told an email can be sent to me with instructions on how to submit this appeal. They cannot quote me how long the appeal will take or even tell me how long it will take for the email to be sent to me with instructions on how to do the appeal, as the customer representative cannot herself send it but can only request it be sent to me.\n\nMerry fucking Christmas, health insurers of America.",

I am a bit ashamed of taking advantage of nepotism. I didn't see a light at the end of the tunnel anymore. I was exhausted and saw a lifeline being thrown and took it.

They sacrifice years of their lives (relationships, hobbies, kids, home ownership), and for many, go into debt to pursue this path. And yet, despite all of this, Mayo has decided that midlevels—whose training is a fraction of that of a doctor—deserve a bigger paycheck. This is an insult to every doctor.\n\nMayo, you should know better.\n\nYou position yourself as a leader in healthcare, but you’re sending a clear message: the years of sacrifice, the intellectual rigor, the emotional toll that doctors in training go through means less than the financial convenience of training midlevels. This kind of pay discrepancy devalues the medical profession, and honestly, it’s downright disrespectful.\n\nThis is more than just a payroll issue; it’s a values issue. It’s about recognizing the true worth of highly trained professionals and investing in them accordingly. Mayo should be setting the example, but instead, they’re perpetuating a system that undervalues the most rigorous path in healthcare.\n\nAdvocating for yourself is just as important as advocating for the patient.\n\nUpvote101Downvote6Go to commentsShare",

      "text": "**Preface**: 8 YoE, Big company (where I work) acquired a small but very successful product last year. I recently moved over to this product to help integrate it into our suite of software.\n\n**Story**: Unfortunately, this product lacked any sort of staff tooling, so support requests were more often than not accomplished by running SQL directly on the production database (💀).\n\nOne of the most standard requests was updating product codes that were _specific_ to a user's account, i.e. a given product code for one user would not work for another user. The SQL boiled down to:\n\n    UPDATE \"users\"\n    SET \"product_access_codes\" = \"...\"\n    WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = '289571032';\n\nLast week, while on-call, I wake up to an \"urgent\" request to enable a user's product codes in time for a demo \"very soon\". Having done this countless times, I whip up and run the following:\n\n    UPDATE \"users\"\n    SET \"product_access_codes\" = \"...\";\n    WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = '289571032';\n\nNotice anything? Well I didn't until I saw the dreaded \"12857294 rows affected\" result. There is truly no stronger stimulant than the realizing that you just bricked the production database by overwriting the user table with bad data. \n\nAfter coming to terms with the reality of my situation over the next 10 seconds (felt like 10 hours) I hit up our SRE team and give them the bad news.\n\n**Outcome:** Luckily for me, our SRE team had backups configured such that we were able to restore the database to the state ~2 minutes before my mishap. Total downtime ended up being ~20 minutes while we ran the restore.\n\nAfter the dust settled I'm glad to report I did not in fact lose my job. I _did_ feel incredibly embarrassed, but equally thankful for my coworkers being empathetic and understanding that mistakes can happen. My EM blamed the situation more on our lack of tooling, so we sliced up some time last week to write our first version of staff tools.\n\n**Takeaway**: Doesn't matter how many times you've done something or how long you've been in the game, fuck-ups do happen and often when you feel the most complacent. This was a query I'd written many times over; the early morning request plus the urgency led me to get complacent and cut corners.\n\nMore importantly though, in retrospect, **always turn off autocommit in your production DB sessions**. I could have avoided the entire situation had my SQL instead been\n\n    \\set AUTOCOMMIT off\n    BEGIN;\n    UPDATE \"users\"\n    SET \"product_access_codes\" = \"...\";\n    WHERE \"users\".\"id\" = '289571032';\n\nUpon seeing the syntax error and rows affected output I could have just ran `ROLLBACK` and avoided the whole situation. I honestly wanted to write this post mainly just to call out the fact that anytime you run SQL in production it should be wrapped in an explicit transaction.",

A chance.\n\nI saw enough in his first term to make up my mind that there were better options for the IBEW.\n\nBut nothing, I mean nothing, in his first term — nothing in my more than 60 years as an American citizen — comes close to the budget bill he just signed as a betrayal of everything I believe government should be for.\n\nNot only will this bill kill hundreds of thousands of jobs that would have been IBEW jobs, but it will rip the rug from under a generation of would-be apprentices and billions of dollars of our wages will evaporate.\n\nThis isn’t just about the elimination of union-friendly tax incentives for clean electric generation jobs.\n\nThis is the wholesale abandonment of a project to electrify our economy that would have made us the competitive marvel of the world with the kind of blue-collar careers we haven’t seen in generations.\n\nNow it’s in tatters.\n\nAnd why?

The deduction they left in to alleviate the struggle of owning and operating a private jet.\n\nAnd you know what doesn’t expire? The $960 billion tax cut for the wealthiest. Their tax cut is forever.\n\nWages will fall, and tariffs will drive prices up. The average family’s energy bill will go up significantly over the next half-decade, and more than 300 rural hospitals will shutter.\n\nThis so-called One Big Beautiful Bill is the greatest transfer of wealth from working people to the rich in our nation’s history.\n\nSo many of our members wanted to believe that Donald Trump was different.

Many interviewers cannot really tell if your code will run, they just see if it “looks correct”. I’ve seen a lot of candidates get hired by borderline writing pseudocode. The lesson here is to waste zero time wondering about nit-picky details like if your loop is off by one, or what that built in method to convert an int to a string is… they care about SPEED and just that you have the right idea.\n\nSecond, Amazon treats their LPs like the holy texts. But the only thing that really matters is delivering to please your superiors no matter what. This means put customer obsession, deliver results, and ownership above all else. These are the rules you live by. You tell these people that you skipped Christmas because you had to fix an open source dependency to unblock some random guy in Indian if you have to…\n\nHonestly I hate this company but if this helps you get hired I’m happy for you, just know that if you do get hired and you BS’d using my tried and true formula, you may get pipped.",

      "title": "After 4 years at Google, here's my honest take on why their work culture and processes didn't work for me.",
      "text": "I recently left Google after nearly four years. I wish I could say it lives up to all the hype, but it didn't. I honestly felt like I did some of the worst work of my career there. The environment, the processes, and team dynamics simply didn't align with my approach for how to collaborate and ship software. I've been reflecting on exactly why I wasn't able to make it work for me.\n\nJust to brace you, I know just how ranty this is going to sound. I'm not writing this as a condemnation of Google, because I know there are people that thrive and enjoy working there. This is just my own personal perspective on it. Take it with a grain of salt.\n\n# Agile is a Sin\n\nI come from companies that do agile processes. It's not perfect, but it's empowering and very adaptive to change. I've been told that agile processes do not scale. So when I joined Google, I was extremely interested in learning how and what Google does to ship software. They must be doing something slightly different or better to ship software at scale, right?\n\nWrong. They quite literally don't have processes around collaboration. It's basically waterfall. Product writes up a doc. Gets buy-in from leadership. Tosses it at engineering. And then we never see them again, so we're left to implement it as we see fit.\n\nIt is literally the most expensive and high risk software development I've seen in my entire career. They basically have blind faith they've hired super smart people that will just magically build the perfect product. Which to be fair, they do quite literally have a lot of *rock star* developers. But relying on purely heroics to ship software is a recipe for burn out and knowledge silos.\n\nAlso, they don't ship software. Deadlines are arbitrary. There are so many times when we approach a deadline only for \"X\" feature needs to absolutely be there on release so we'll just push out the release. I think deadlines are stupid, so I don't want to pretend like I care about them. But I do care about shipping software. The sooner you ship, the sooner you can start to learn and prove that your core assumptions are right or wrong. So to ship sooner, you need to downscope. If your MVP (minimal viable product) requires several really difficult features to implement, maybe it's not an MVP anymore. But then again, I guess no one called it an MVP, but me, who is used to shipping software regularly.\n\n# The Doc Machine\n\nSo, if you're not regularly shipping software, how can you possibly measure impact?\n\nDocs.\n\nEndless docs.\n\nCountless docs.\n\nSo many docs that it can be impossible to find what doc says what you did.\n\nGoogle's mission is to \"organize the world's information.\" Internally in Google, they generate a lot of information in docs, and it's very hard to search and find the information you're looking for.\n\nWhat's the point of docs no one reads? Well, since software doesn't get shipped, I assume it just acts as a laundry list of links when attempting to show impact for your performance reviews or promotions. You might not have shipped anything, but at least you left a paper trail of what you didn't ship.\n\nYou want to know the worst part of it? They want you to write a doc on a system you don't understand. So you write it up, make some assumptions and send it out for approval. No one reads it to approve it. Let's say you get your single approver and start implementing. Guess what, your core assumption is wrong. The data isn't in the right place, or the data you thought had what you needed, doesn't. Now you need to rewrite the doc.\n\nWhat's the point of getting approval? What's the point of a doc that is wrong from the start? What's the point of upfront design that is wrong? Why not just implement and find out what actually is going on and make it work?\n\nThe point is, it's just theater to make it look like we're doing our jobs. Why isn't the software the evidence we're doing our job?\n\nI'm not trying to say docs are bad, and everything should just be tribal knowledge. But I am saying docs that need to be rewritten from the get-go are a waste of time.\n\n# Bad docs\n\nIronically, despite needing to write so many docs to implement things. When you read other people's docs, you might notice something. They're very high-level. They're more like a thesis, then like actual documentation on how to use an API.\n\nWhat is the point of docs that don't answer how to use an API?\n\nFocusing on the high-level philosophy of a service is honestly distracting and unhelpful. I think I understand why this happens. It's hard to keep docs up to date. So if you keep them high-level, they won't become obsolete or need to be updated. But I don't care about your thesis defense; I just want to use your software to solve my problem.\n\nAnd I know Google can write good docs. [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) has fantastic documentation. [Proto Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/overview/) have great docs. Both of these are made by Google. I guess the difference is they're public facing and Google doesn't prioritize internal docs like they do their external facing ones.\n\n# A Culture of Silence\n\nSo, there is a lot of lip service towards how open Google is. Say how they're trying to encourage employees in fireside chats to not ask anonymous questions so that leadership can follow up with the individual to gain more context. (This, by the way, does not prevent people from asking anonymously, which they do.)\n\nThere is also a culture of no-blame retrospectives. They don't run regularly, even when I advocate for them. And worst of all, when we finally do run retrospectives, we don't discuss challenges and problems we are encountering. So, what's the point of a retrospective that doesn't talk about pain points and mitigation strategies? From my perspective, it just looks like theater and a way to paint a false view that everything is good and we have nothing to complain about. Or worse, that we are helpless and we really cannot change anything.\n\nComing from companies with genuinely open cultures where we fostered candid and open discussions, it's baffling to me that no one seems willing to put in the minimal effort to improve everyone's lives.\n\nIt is better to be positive about a broken system and keep the status quo than it is to ask people to put in a laughable small level of effort to make everyone's life better. Not everything is going smoothly all the time. And assuming we **want** it to run smoothly, we should probably discuss the pain points and workarounds or solutions to them. Knowledge silos are bad. More open discussions can reduce knowledge silos which reduces the burden on individuals and gives everyone a balance for job responsibilities.\n\n# A Culture of Bottom-Up (but only if it's top-down)\n\nSo, in meetings with leadership. They emphasize that our *bottom-up culture* is how we do such great work. And by *bottom-up*, they apparently mean *top-down*.\n\n# When Bottom-Up Meets Brick Wall\n\nSo, let's say our UXR (user experience research team) has come up with an obvious gap in our offerings. What would you do? Perhaps gather some people from multiple disciplines and brainstorm a solution. Or maybe you just get leadership and design in a room and iterate on who knows what behind closed doors for literal months, before you ever even involve engineering. And for those few months, you pull engineering off their current teams in a large-scale reorg and don't give them marching orders instead just give them a bunch of vague ideas of what they might want to build. Like...what is engineering supposed to do? Build against an invisible moving target? The answer is, that is exactly what we do. Not because it's a good use of our time, but because we have nothing better to do and we have no input into the vision of the product.\n\nSo let's say, you're an engineer, like yours truly, and you think that process is stupid, and instead you really do want to try to implement a bottoms up initiative. So maybe, see a feature, we originally spec'd out but was dropped because they didn't see the current value in implementing it. But it sounds kind of cool, and shouldn't be that difficult to get an MVP for this feature. Maybe you go to reach out across teams, pull in people that own data you need, a team that works on Android and iOS, and try to get people from the backend team so you can make an e2e MVP to demonstrate this feature is doable. Also, act as a test bed to show smaller agile processes work and probably how we should handle work in the org.\n\nSounds pretty encouraging, right? But here is the real problem, one of the teams is a no-show. Not only are they a no-show, they also refuse to work with you and ignore your messages. You escalate to your manager and tech lead, and that team also ignores them too. You work with the other teams and implement everything, but say the one thing to tie everything together and make it work e2e. Let's say a backend team refused to work with you. So, naturally, offer to do the work for them. And they tell you to not do that. Because it's not my code base, I'm not on call, and I don't have to maintain it. So what do you do?\n\nWhat I did was create a video demo that made it look like it should work and presented it to leadership. We were reorged before this demo was even presented, so the feature died on the vine.\n\n# The Only MVP Is Minimum Viable Plausible Deniability\n\nLet's say that you do still believe in the rhetoric that, *the organization really does believe in bottom-up*. So you take some time and write up a doc (which is an activity you don't enjoy but if that's how the game is played, and you want to play ball, you do it). The doc outlines an open source initiative that is coincidentally attempting to solve the space we just tried to fill. But since there's an open-source community trying to solve the same problem space, maybe we can just leverage that and even help them grow at the same time. Anyway, it was super nice to have leadership hear me out, but they didn't want to go with it, because it turns out that one of the reasons we hamstrung our last project was because we were attempting to skirt a legal definition that the open source project is tackling head on. Suddenly, it made more sense: The original project was destined to fail, not because it was a bad idea, but because they were trying to handicap the implementation to avoid legal scrutiny.\n\nFundamentally, we're not trying to build good software or solve problems. We're just trying to do something without bringing legal scrutiny to Google.\n\nI understand getting sued sucks, and the law is often weaponized against Google. But why handicap ourselves? There are so many other ideas out there. Why not pursue things that are higher value and lower risk? I cynically believe it could just be virtue signaling to investors, to show Google is trying new things and still taking risks. But their risks seem high-risk, low-reward, compared to the normal practices I'm used to, which focus on mitigating risk and prioritizing high value. Taking risks here seems to be about signaling growth, but are they truly growing? Wouldn't the more obvious path be to take the calculated legal risk to solve a real problem and potentially achieve genuine growth? I don't know; I'm not in leadership. I just had a worm's-eye view of the machine.\n\n# Grassroots Agility, Stomped by Apathy\n\nLet's say you came from an agile background and you even believe it. Because you've seen it solve very obvious communication issues that you see arise in large organizations. You've experienced it firsthand, you know it works. You go and explain it to your manager, they say that there are organization issues and leadership is resistant to change. They don't discourage you from trying, but they kind of set the expectations that nothing will change. But, what else are you supposed to do? Nothing?\n\nSo you have a meeting with your skip manager (your manager's manager) once again advocating to adopt agile processes and maybe get more stakeholder buy-in. And they give you the advice to do it locally with your team. You know, \"bottom-up\" kind of stuff.\n\nYou present it to the team. They hate it. They don't want processes. They don't want collaboration or more communication. They say agile practices are dehumanizing and that we are not interchangeable cogs in the machine. A bit of a disservice towards agile processes. But they are willing to try some of the ceremonies.\n\nBut literally, for any reason whatsoever, they cancel meetings, like retrospectives or stand-ups. Maybe we need more time to finish a feature, or maybe it's a holiday, or we get reorged. And we never start up the meeting again, at least until I ask for it. Followed by it once again being canceled at the drop of a hat. And no one cares. They don't see the value in it. And to be honest, the ceremonies are toothless because we don't discuss actual problems, we don't discuss work progress to reduce knowledge silos, and action items are never done and are also usually not meaningful anyway.\n\nThe reason people don't see the value of agile processes is not that it's not a good framework to address communication gaps, but because just doing the ceremonies without the communication makes them pointless. There is value in the ceremonies if they're being used to address the problems. But actively ignoring the problems, even with ceremonies, means we're now just wasting people's time.\n\n# Bottom-Up, Top-Down, and Going Nowhere\n\nIf there is a bottom-up culture at Google, it is self sabotaging. There is so much momentum for the status quo that actual process change is near impossible. The only change that appears to work is a top-down mandate, which they try every year with constant reorgs and get the same results.\n\n# There is No Team in I\n\nSo, coming from an agile background (I know I sound like I'm in a cult, with how much I bring it up, but bear with me), I've come to the understanding that I as an individual do not necessarily matter. It's about putting aside ego and working together on a larger goal. This also comes with a nice benefit of distributing responsibility, and reducing burn out.\n\nThat's pretty damn *ungoogley*. At Google, they're rugged cowboys. They pull themselves up by the bootstrap and don't care about your collaboration. You need to own everything. Your work, your feature, your project, your process, your career. No one is here to help you. You need to just do it yourself. Which is ironic, as [googley-ness](https://staffeng.medium.com/being-googly-62b75dd642df) should theoretically not embody it. But the performance evaluation surely doesn't emphasize trying to make teamwork work.\n\n[A bus factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor) of 1 is seen as a positive thing. It means you've made yourself invaluable. You are the sole point of contact, and despite that sounding like a lot of annoying responsibility, it's perceived as good because you *own* it.\n\nI hate knowledge silos. I do not believe it makes anyone more valuable. I fought against the hoarding of knowledge. I'd include people into meetings to make sure I'm not the only one with context. I'd ask stupid questions and repeat talking points in meetings to make sure I understood and we were aligned. These are all considered negative things at Google. Because it is seen as wasting everyone's time in the meeting. It is better to repeat yourself with several dozen 1:1s (or I guess write yet another doc no one will read) than it is to talk it over in a group and make sure there is no ambiguity.\n\nIt could just be me though. But it sure felt like it, when my manager said I was *\"leaning on others too much.\"* How else am I supposed to read that?\n\nI've never seen such an environment that is literally so hostile to collaboration.\n\n# Performative Theater\n\nI hate 1:1s. I think they're a waste of time. I would even argue that most 1:1s are a waste of time in every context. I'm probably being hyperbolic, as I'm sure there must be cases where 1:1s are beneficial. But I'm struggling to think of one right now.\n\n1:1s are a bottleneck to communication. And judging by how often my 1:1s were canceled with my managers, I'd have to say they don't value them either.\n\nSo, I'm a huge advocate for openness and transparency. And after one reorg (I went through 5 reorgs in my 4 years at Google, and been through 7 managers, chaos is the norm) leadership was attempting to be more open and transparent and so allowed anyone to join their meetings. So, since I felt like I did not have enough context to understand their decisions, I joined those meetings.\n\nWhen they asked if everyone had context on a doc, I was the only person to raise my hand and said I did not. I guess this was a sin to acknowledge my own ignorance, because it turns out after the next meetings I was removed from the subsequent meetings. I asked my manager if I could be brought back to gain more context, and he told me I had enough context to do my job. While probably true, I had a suspicion that my work was not very high priority. Maybe we should work on something else. Anyway, this taught me that it's all optics. I think my manager wanted to control the narrative. If he wasn't there to be a middle man, what is his job? Like, seriously, what *is* his job? I still don't understand what value he brought.\n\n# Tech Debt Forever\n\nTo say Google's code base is complex is an understatement. Not only is it complicated, it's also a mess. Not only is it a mess, but it's also poorly documented. And not only that, but it actively fights you as you make changes and try to understand it.\n\nCryptic compile errors. Cryptic build errors. Cryptic run time errors. And just when you think you've finally got it working. There are blockers on merging the code because of invisible linting errors you didn't know you were violating. Or there is some weird test case that broke, but only after 3 hours of running tests in the CI pipeline. Or maybe, you just want to delete some code, but it turns out that the code you're trying to delete has a different release schedule, so it cannot be deleted with other code. And the other code is dependent on the first bit of code that you cannot delete being deleted. The code is constantly fighting you. And maybe if we could discuss these issues in a group, we could understand the problems quicker or come up with strategies to mitigate them...but it turns out talking about how much it sucks to write code is frowned upon. So you just need to keep it to yourself. And I'm left wondering, *am I the problem?* Is my career a lie? Do I have imposter syndrome if I don't actually know what I'm doing? It makes you question everything.\n\nSo I talked with my director (the skip’s manager) about my challenges. And I was candid about it. And he said, \"It sounds like you need mentorship.\" And I said, that's exactly what I need. And he said he'd help get me some. I messaged him every week for a few months. He offloaded this responsibility to my manager, who naturally, did nothing. By the time I left, I made the request 8 months prior. I was clearly not getting the mentorship I asked for. My manager's *wonderful* feedback was, \"maybe you should find your own mentorship.\" And it does make me wonder, \"what is *your* job if it is not to help me do *my* job better?\" Anyway, I also was unable to find mentorship on my own. And it does make me wonder, does anyone truly understand the beast that is Google's complex internally built tech stack with poor documentation? Even the internal AI that is usually pretty good at explaining some of the code, will just straight-up hallucinate how the code works and then it becomes very hard to understand. The AI will tell you a very convincing lie, but you won't know it's a hallucination or how to possibly fix it, because the documentation is poor and the only way to learn how it really works is to reverse-engineer it by performing code archaeology.\n\n# I'm out\n\nSo I left Google. It was amicable. This was, of course, also only my personal experience in my particular organization. I've been told different parts of the org and different teams are said to have different cultures. Heck, even some people might even thrive in the culture I described. But it's not for me.\n\nThey gave me severance, which was honestly extremely nice. I tried so hard to bring cultural change to Google, but there is no willingness to change. Honestly, with the amount of money they're printing with ads and search, there is no pressure for them to make any changes.\n\nThere is a clear cultural mismatch between what I value and what Google values. Even if Google pays lip service that they value the same things I value, their actions clearly show they do not. And so, I am honestly happy to be free from them and given the time to look for a place that values what I want.\n\nI used to believe I was *a mercenary for hire to the highest bidder*. But you know what? Apparently, within reason. I just want to work, collaborate, and iterate on software. Is that asking for too much? The one thing I can take away from my time at Google is that I now have a clearer understanding of what I'm looking for in my next step.",

      "text": "Background - I'm a senior engineer with 10yrs+ experience that has worked at a few Big Tech companies and startups. I'm not sure why I'm writing this post, but I feel like all the tech \"influencers\" of 2021 glamorized this career to unrealistic expectations, and I need to correct some of the preconceived notions.\n\nThe last 3 years have been absolutely brutal in terms of declining engineering culture. What's worse is that the toxicity is creating a feedback loops that exacerbates the declining culture.\n\nSome of the crazy things I've heard\n\n* \"I want to you look at every one of your report and ask yourself, is this person producing enough value to justify their high compensations\" (director to his managers)\n* \"If that person doesn't have the right skills, get rid of them and we'll find someone that does\" (VP to an entire organization after pivoting technology direction). \n   * I.e. - It's not worth training people anymore, even if they're talented and can learn anything new. It's all sink or swim now\n* \"If these candidates aren't willing to grind hundreds of leetcode questions, they don't have mental fortitude to handle this job\" (engineers to other engineers)\n   * To be fair, I felt like this was a defense mechanism. The amount of BS that you need to put up with to not get laid off has grown significantly.\n* \"Working nights and weekends is expected\" (manager to my coworker that was on PIP because he didn't work weekends).\n   * I've always felt this pressure previously. But I've never heard it truly be verbalized until recently.\n\n  \nFinal thoughts\n\n* Software engineering in big tech feels more akin to investment banking now. Most companies expect this to be your life. You truly have to be \"passionate\" about making a bunch of money, or \"passionate\" about the product to survive.\n* Don't get too excited if your company stock skyrockets. The leaders of the company will continue to pinch every bit of value out of you because they're technically paying you more now (e.g. meta) and they know that the job market is harsh.\n* Prior to 2022, Amazon was considered the most toxic big tech company. But ironically, their multiple layers of bureaucracy and stagnating stock price likely prevented the the culture from getting too much worse, whereas many other companies have drastically exceeded Amazon in terms of toxicity in 2025. IMO, Amazon is solidly 50th percentile in terms of culture now. If you couldn't handle Amazon culture prior to 2022, then you definitely can't handle the type of culture that exists now.",

      "text": "So I remember being a sous chef, I worked infinitely harder and longer than every server in the building, but my take home pay was $404 a week (I was on salary, that’s my own fault and not entirely relevant to this argument). Meanwhile, every single night I heard servers complain when they “only made $150 today”. Compare my 14 hour work day to their 5 hour work day.\n\nMy wife was a server for 7 years. There were some jobs where she hardly made anything, there were some jobs where she made bank and didn’t even have to think before buying anything. Here’s the main thing, you hear servers say all of the time in America “well maybe if we got paid a livable wage instead of relying on tips it would be different, but until then tipping is a requirement and if you can’t afford to tip then don’t eat out!” but I’ve offered to pay my servers a livable wage and split tips with the whole restaurant, (AFTER hearing them say that for weeks!) they all said they would walk out that same day if it went into effect. My wife tends to agree as well, they don’t want to be paid well, they want to rely on tips, because the earning potential is FAR higher that way. Furthermore, a server can quit anywhere and start anywhere else almost in a heartbeat, they don’t have to be there, if the money really really sucks, they can and will leave.\n\nOn paper, they make $2 an hour plus tips. In reality, they often make more than anyone else in the building. They have the POTENTIAL of making $30-50 an hour. Hell I’ve seen bartenders make upwards of $100 an hour some days, so why the fuck would they accept a measly $20 an hour? I wouldn’t in their position and you wouldn’t either, it’s just basic math, so it’s all bullshit to get you to feel bad and tip more.",

I’m running for U.S. Senate in Illinois.\n\n- r/IBEW AMA:\nhttps://redd.it/1o3hkyl\n\n- r/Illinois AMA:\nhttps://redd.it/1nr1oxe\n\n\nBrothers, we turned in our 7,700 petition signatures on Monday and we’re entering Phase 2 of our campaign. We’re expanding the team, collecting donations, and getting out the vote.\n\nWe need union leadership in the Senate. There are no active union members in the Senate. Our middle class, our working class, our working people, are dying. And they won’t stop until we get ourselves in the door. Our representatives have betrayed us, and we’re taking America back from oligarchs and lobbyists and politicians who have sold us out for profit.\n\nI want to know what you expect from your U.S. Senator. Please ask questions, make comments and let’s have conversation. \n\nHere’s what we plan to do while we’re in office:\n\n1. Tax billionaires. We implement a 1950’s era 92% tax rate on individuals worth $50million or more. It includes a 5% wealth tax on billionaires and a 40% tax penalty for high value individuals who attempt to leave the country or move money to evade these taxes. 💰\n\n2. End the Pink Taxes against women. Eliminate unfair discriminatory taxes and pricing against women, including for menstrual and hygiene products, pregnancy, childbirth, childcare. Women will no longer have to pay to be women. We’ll reduce the costs of these expenditures to 0. 🎀\n\n3. Increased support for teachers and farmers. We increase the wages educators and farmers receive. In the wealthiest country in the world, we will have the best educators and best education. Eliminating quality of life issues such as low pay will increase the talent and results in those sectors. Implementing union ideals, structure, know-how will facilitate strong systems that allow for free and subsidized  secondary education, effective trade schools, and abolishing right to work states across America. 🌱\n\nIf you believe in the vision, support. Ask questions. Get involved. We’re here. We want universal basic income, we want universal health. We want every American to be able to take care of a family of four with 2 cars and a garage on one income. We want to restore wealth to working people and the middle class. We want the unions in office, because that is the key to success that’s been missing.\n\nSend a donation, be a part of the team, introduce us to someone we need to know! Anyone want to help create an IBEW shirt for the campaign?\n\nHere are the links to assist. Send us a message as well if you’d like to be on the team.\n\n- Donate at https://ActBlue.com/JumpForSenate\n- Official Website: https://www.jump4senate.com\n- Check out our TikTok at: https://www.tiktok.com/@jumpforsenate?_t=ZT-8yb78hsUvde&amp;_r=1\n- Read our Instagram Threads at: https://www.threads.com/@jumpforsenate\n- See more Links at: https://www.atom.bio/jumpforsenate\n\nWe will win.

I grabbed the mouse in a second, only to see that she had picked up about 5 USBs. I asked why, and she said they were for her students. I threw a Hail Mary and asked her if she'd be compensated, but of course the answer was no. The whole ride back, she was emailing the parents that she bought them. \n\nOn a Saturday. \n\nPlease just don't do this. Y'all need to stand up and just say no, please don't feel obligated to work off the clock. You are not responsible for their school supplies. You should absolutely turn your phone on at 8:55 and off at 3:20. Work your paid prep time but don't give a second more unless YOU want to. \n\nIf work doesn't get done, so be it. Your family needs you much more than your school: the weekend if for them. \n\nEDITED TO ADD: love all your comments. You're all heroes. Wanted to just include the concept of induced demand someone brought up: the reward for finishing your work is often just more work and more stress. It's not worth it. You're more than your job, always remember that. \n\nEDITED AGAIN: I wanted to respond to a common perspective you've all shared: \"maybe she actually wanted to\". Folks, I've seen this woman exhausted, pale, and holding her head almost in tears after a long day. She seems burnt out, and although she hasn't said it, her gas tank looks like it's been running on empty for a while now. I don't want to make it look like I know what it's like to be a teacher because I don't. \n\nBut there has to be another way. You need to be adequately recognized and compensated for what you do. Think of a lawyer billing additional time for a more complicated case. Think of a mechanic increasing their charge because a \"simple\" fix turned out to be more intricate than originally expected. To echo a comment I read: you're not just a teacher. You're a human being with the same stuff we all have - hopes, dreams, goals, hobbies, and a family - that just so happens to be a teacher. \n\nFINAL EDIT: I want to thank everyone who responded to this post. You've all shared such unique perspectives on time management, salary, and education as a whole. I think I'll always come back to this post and reply to comments when I can. From a non-teacher, thank you for caring and commenting. ",

Humans only had to intervene 4-6 times per campaign.\n\nAnthropic calls this \"the first documented case of a large-scale cyberattack executed without substantial human intervention.\"\n\nThe hackers convinced Claude to hack for them. Then Claude analyzed targets -&gt; spotted vulnerabilities -&gt; wrote exploit code -&gt; harvested passwords -&gt; extracted data, and documented everything. All by itself.\n\nClaude's trained to refuse harmful requests. So how'd they get it to hack?\n\nThey jailbroke it. Broke the attack into small, innocent-looking tasks. Told Claude it was an employee of a legitimate cybersecurity firm doing defensive testing. Claude had no idea it was actually hacking real companies.\n\nThe hackers used Claude Code, which is Anthropic's coding tool. It can search the web, retrieve data run software. Has access to password crackers, network scanners, and security tools.\n\nSo they set up a framework. Pointed it at a target. Let Claude run autonomously.\n\nThe AI made thousands of requests per second; the attack speed impossible for humans to match.\n\nAnthropic said \"human involvement was much less frequent despite the larger scale of the attack.\"\n\nBefore this, hackers used AI as an advisor. Ask it questions. Get suggestions. But humans did the actual work.\n\nNow? AI does the work. Humans just point it in the right direction and check in occasionally.\n\nAnthropic detected it, banned the accounts, notified victims, and coordinated with authorities.

      "text": "I have been a NICU Respiratory Therapist for almost 10 years. In the largest NICU in my state. I have seen a lot of sad cases and infant death but I’m struggling quite a bit with this one. More than I have in a long time. My state like many others recently made abortion illegal with few exceptions. So I knew this day was going to come but nothing prepared me for just how bad this was. The baby had a severe case of a horrible extremely painful and gruesome fetal anomaly which I won’t say what it was. The anomaly isn’t always fatal so it doesn’t fall under one of the exceptions in the state for fatal anomalies. But with how horrible of an anomaly this was the mother tried to do the abortion at home. I don’t know much about the mother’s situation and I wouldn’t share anything if I did. But my state is at the very bottom in the country for access to prenatal care. So I would guess that she wasn’t made aware of the disease until late in the pregnancy. So when she attempted the abortion and had excessive blood loss and came to the maternity ED, the baby was far enough along we are required to resuscitate. \n\nEven though the baby was not wanted, I still had to resuscitate. I had to get an airway and secure it and again in my 10 years experience, this was the most grisly thing I have ever done. And for what, the baby didn’t even live to 24 hours old. It was horrifying. \n\nIt’s been weeks now and I can’t get it out of my head. Due to the abortion ban, I knew something like this would happen but never like this. My heart is broken for that mom. My heart is broken for that baby and how much pain it must have been in. But the biggest feeling I have is anger for all those people that voted for it. I have been talking about and showing google pictures of the disease to everyone I know so they too can know the gravity of what this abortion ban means. Even though there are exceptions in the law, it doesn’t matter because either our access is so low that women are not able to get abortions even when they are suppose to be allowed to or they have a technically not 100% fatal disease and so are not except. This is so inhumane, I don’t know how I’m going to carry on doing what I do. Is this going to be my new normal? I have always had to deal with patients that I thought to myself they should have been aborted. But the parents made the decision to try anyway. But for this baby NO ONE I mean NO ONE in that deliver room wanted this baby. Everyone in the room from the mom, the dad, to the neonatologist did not want to have this baby born and have to resuscitate but some law maker and the people that voted for it that are not even in the fucking room or in the same universe of understanding are forcing us to. Im sitting here sick to my stomach about what happened and for the future of what this means and I don’t know if I can carry on with this. ",

I’m thinking I should also get pens, sticky notes, a gift card for the teacher and other miscellaneous supplies. \n\nWe’re high income in a low income district (they automatically provide free breakfast and lunch for all students because so many are poverty level), we’d be paying more for a private program but the districts is considered the best. \n\nIs that too much or can I go wild and it’ll be appreciated? I joked about setting up a monthly delivery to the office (and sending items -coffees and what not- for the office staff as a thank you). \n\nIs there anything else you as teachers would like that I’m not thinking of?\n\nEdit: Thank you all so much for the suggestions and feedback! I really appreciate all of the responses.\n\nEdit 2: When I had asked the teacher she said yes. I made sure to buy the products they use in the school.\n\nEdit 3: It’s actually sad that this doesn’t seem to be the norm. I feel like it’s peanuts. I hope what I’m working to do becomes below average and most others do more.\n\nI’ll be inquiring about joining the PTA, starting fundraisers, hosting dinners on in-service and conference nights, help with funding for field trips for kids that aren’t paid for, Amazon wish lists for classes, providing larger appliances that are needed or just nice to have for staff and seeing about how much I can supply the gym, arts and library. \n\nI appreciate these responses so very much. We were anticipating spending so much more for a private program, so I’d love to help work to continue that this is the best school in our region. You’ve all given me such incredible feedback and ideas, I can’t thank you enough for taking the time to respond.\n\nI’d rather put $12k into this school than a starter tuition which would then escalate. I hope many other parents donate and help out as well so our kiddos and teachers can thrive. You all do incredible work that is sadly under-appreciated and I hope I can help lead a change. My goal is to be the kind of parent I wish I had and you’ve given me so much to help do that. Thank you so much for this. I didn’t except this kind of response.

She looked at me and asked, \"Can I disconnect?\"\n\nI remembered that scenario from over a decade ago. I shook my head no and told her to get the address. If it is a prank, I'd take the fall.\n\nI understand nervous laughter, but I cannot think of a worse scenario for laughing uncontrollably. I wonder what it must be like for someone who has this condition: trying to convey an important message but being unable to do so. It must be a nightmare.",

      "text": "On a 1 mile final into PHNL and caught this amazing shot. Sorry for shitty pic, little hard to take a good pic on final.\n\nBut this wasn’t even the most interesting part of the day.\n\nJust got my PPL 3 months ago. Last week I flew to Honolulu to renew my medical, and took my wife for her first ever flight with me. \n\nDuring takeoff airspeed seemed to be coming up slow, near mtow for a 172 and I began flying at 45kts indicated. First thought is did I forget to retract flaps after preflight? Nope flaps full up. Kept nose down nervous of stalling but I “feel” fast. Look back at airspeed-both steam gauge and digital failed. Dashed or a negative speed shown…. F*ck. \n\nGlance down at iPad and ground speed is up to 85kts so I climb a bit to avoid the construction barrier. Declared emergency and kept that throttle in. Told the wife not to worry. Declaring emergency was a “formality” (meanwhile sh*ttin my britches) because it’s a 8g11 crosswind and trying to read my ground speed at a quick glance is difficult.\n\nObviously landed safe. Screamed it in at 85kts just to be safe. 7000ft of runway, so plenty of distance to float it down. Pulled up to owners hangar. He is A&amp;P and IA, I’m an A&amp;P. Knew it was simple pitot blockage. Had been heavily raining past few days. Blew line out, yup big ‘ol slug of water was in pitot line. Cleaned pitot drain hole, tested, and jumped back in.\n\nWife was real champ. Being around A&amp;P’s for several years she had no fear and jumped right back in the plane with me. 45 minutes later and headed back to Honolulu. \n\nThat delay then gave us the coolest damn site I’ve ever had from a plane. On a 1 mile final passed right over top of this submarine headed into Pearl Harbor.\n\nOne hell of a day for sure.\n",

      "title": "My Data Science Manifesto from a Self Taught Data Scientist",
      "text": "**Background**\n\nI’m a self-taught data scientist, with about 5 years of data analyst experience and now about 5 years as a Data Scientist. I’m more math minded than the average person, but I’m not special. I have a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering, and have worked alongside 6 data scientists, 4 of which have PHDs and the other 2 have a masters. Despite being probably, the 6th out of 7 in natural ability, I have been the 2nd most productive data scientist out of the group.\n\n\n**Gatekeeping**\n\nEvery day someone on this subreddit asks some derivative of “what do I need to know to get started in ML/DS?” The answers are always smug and give some insane list of courses and topics one must master. As someone who’s been on both sides, this is attitude extremely annoying and rampart in the industry. I don’t think you can be bad at math and have no pre-requisite knowledge, and be successful, but the levels needed are greatly exaggerated. Most of the people telling you these things are just posturing due to insecurity.\n\n\n\nAs a mechanical engineering student, I had at least 3 calculus courses, a linear algebra course, and a probability course, but it was 10+ years before I attempted to become a DS, and I didn’t remember much at all. This sub, and others like it, made me think I had to be an expert in all these topics and many more to even think about trying to become a data scientist. \n\n\n\nWhen I started my journey, I would take coding, calculus, stats, linear algebra, etc. courses. I’d take a course, do OK in it, and move onto the next thing. However, eventually I’d get defeated because I realized I couldn’t remember much from the courses I took 3 months prior. It just felt like too much information for me to hold at a single time while working a full-time job. I never got started on actually solving problems because the internet and industry told me I needed to be an expert in all these things.\n\n\n**What you actually need**\n\nThe reality is, 95% of the time you only need a basic understanding of these topics. Projects often require a deeper dive into something else, but that's a case by case basis, and you figure that out as you go.\n\n\nFor calculus, you don't need to know how to integrate multivariable functions by hand. You need to know that derivatives create a function that represents the slope of the original function, and that where the derivative = 0 is a local min/max. You need to know integrals are area under the curve.\n\n\n\nFor stats, you need to understand what a p value represents. You don't need to know all the different tests, and when to use them. You need to know that they exist and why you need them. When it's time to use one, just google it, and figure out which one best suits your use case.\n\n\n\nFor linear algebra, you don't need to know how to solve for eigenvectors by hand, or whatever other specific things you do in that class. You need to know how to ‘read’ it. It is also helpful to know properties of linear algebra. Like the cross product of 2 vectors yields a vector perpendicular to both.\n\n\n\nFor probability, you need to understand basic things, but again, just google your specific problem.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to be an expert software dev. You need to write ok code, and be able to use chatGPT to help you improve it little by little.\n\n\n\nYou don't need to know how to build all the algorithms by hand. A general understanding of how they work is enough in 95% of cases.\n\n\n\nOf all of those things, the only thing you absolutely NEED to get started is basic coding ability. \n\n\n\nBy far the number one technical ability needed to 'master' is understanding how to \"frame\" your problem, and how to test and evaluate and interpret performance. If you can ensure that you're accurately framing the problem and evaluating the model or alogithm, with metrics that correctly align with the use case, that's enough to start providing some real value. I often see people asking things like \"should I do this feature engineering technique for this problem?\" or “which of these algorithms will perform best?”. The answer should usually be, \"I don't know, try it, measure it, and see\". Understanding how the algorithms work can give you clues into what you should try, but at the end of the day, you should just try it and see.   \n\n\n\nDespite the posturing in the industry, very few people are actually experts in all these domains. Some people are better at talking the talk than others, but at the end of the day, you WILL have to constantly research and learn on a project by project basis. That’s what makes it fun and interesting. As you gain PRACTICAL experience, you will grow, you will learn, you will improve beyond what you could've ever imagined. Just get the basics down and get started, don't spin your wheels trying and failing to nail all these disciplines before ever applying anything.\n\n\n\nThe reason I’m near the top in productivity while being near the bottom in natural and technical ability is my 5 years of experience as a data analyst at my company. During this time, I got really good at exploring my companies’ data. When you are stumped on problem, intelligently visualizing the data often reveals the solution. I’ve also had the luxury of analyzing our data from all different perspectives. I’d have assignments from marketing, product, tech support, customer service, software, firmware, and other technical teams. I understand the complete company better than the other data scientists. I’m also just aware of more ‘tips and tricks’ than anyone else.  \n\n\n\nGood domain knowledge and data exploration skills with average technical skills will outperform good technical skills with average domain knowledge and data exploration almost every time. \n\n\n**Advice for those self taught**\n\n\nI’ve been on the hiring side of things a few times now, and the market is certainly difficult. I think it would be very difficult for someone to online course and side project themselves directly into a DS job. The side project would have to be EXTREMELY impressive to be considered. However, I think my path is repeatable.\n\n\n\nI taught myself basic SQL and Tableau and completed a few side projects. I accepted a job as a data analyst, in a medium sized (100-200 total employees) on a team where DS and DA shared the same boss. The barrier to DA is likely higher than it was ~10 years ago, but it's definitely something achievable. My advice would be to find roles that you have some sort of unique experience with, and tailor your resume to that connection. No connection is too small. For example, my DA role required working with a lot of accelerometer data. In my previous job as a test engineer, I sometimes helped set up accelerometers to record data from the tests. This experience barely helped me at all when actually on the job, but it helped my resume actually get looked at. For entry level jobs employers are looking for ANY connection, because most entry level resumes all look the same.\n\n\nThe first year or two I excelled at my role as a DA. I made my boss aware that I wanted to become a DS eventually. He started to make me a small part of some DS projects, running queries, building dashboards to track performance and things like that. I was also a part of some of the meetings, so I got some insight into how certain problems were approached. \n\n\n\nMy boss made me aware that I would need to teach myself to code and machine learning. My role in the data science projects grew over time, but I was ultimately blocked from becoming a DS because I kept trying and failing to learn to code and the 25 areas of expertise reddit tells you that you need by taking MOOCs. \n\n  \n\nEventually, I paid up for DataQuest. I naively thought the course would teach me everything I needed to know. While you will not be proficient in anything DS upon completing, the interactive format made it easy to jump into 30-60 minutes of structured coding every day. Like a real language consistency is vital. \n\n\n\nOnce I got to the point where I could do some basic coding, I began my own side project. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING. ONCE YOU GET THE BASELINE KNOWLEDGE, JUST GET STARTED WORKING ON THINGS. This is where the real learning began. You'll screw things up, and that's ok. Titanic problem is fine for day 1, but you really need a project of your own. I picked a project that I was interested in and had a function that I would personally use (I'm on V3 of this project and it's grown to a level that I never could've dreamed of at the time). This was crucial in ensuring that I stuck with the project, and had real investment in doing it correctly. When I didn’t know how to do something in the project, I would research it and figure it out. This is how it works in the real world.\n\n\n\nAfter 3 months of Dataquest and another 3 of a project (along with 4 years of being a data analyst) I convinced my boss to assign me DS project. I worked alongside another data scientist, but I owned the project, and they were mostly there for guidance, and coded some of the more complex things. I excelled at that project, and was promoted to data scientist, and began getting projects of my own, with less and less oversight. We have a very collaborative work environment, and the data scientists are truly out to help each other. We present our progress to each other often which allows us all to learn and improve. I have been promoted twice since I began DS work.\n\n\n\nI'd like to add that you can almost certainly do all this in less time than it took me. I wasted a lot of time spinning my wheels. ChatGPT is also a great resource that could also increase your learning speed. Don't blindly use it, but it's a great resource.\n\n\n**Tldr:** Sir this is Wendy’s.\n\n**Edit:** I’m not saying to never go deeper into things, I’m literally always learning. I go deeper into things all the time. Often in very niche domains, but you don't need to be a master in all things get started or even excel. Be able to understand generalities of those domains, and dig deeper when the problem calls for it. Learning a concept when you have a direct application is much more likely to stick.\n\n\nI thought it went without saying, but I’m not saying those things I listed are literally the only things you need to know about those topics, I was just giving examples of where relatively simple concepts were way more important than specifics.\n\n**Edit #2:** I'm not saying schooling is bad. Yes obviously having a masters and/or PhD is better than not. I'm directing this to those who are working a full time job who want to break into the field, but taking years getting a masters while working full time and going another 50K into debt is unrealistic",

CRUD queries? ORM and scaffolding tools came in. Simple blog site? Wordpress cornered the market. Even on the hardware side, you need a server? AWS got you covered.\n\nBut somehow, we didn't end up working any less after these innovations. The needed expertise then just transferred from:\n\n\\* People who handcoded queries -&gt; people who write ORM code\n\n\\* People who handcoded blog sites -&gt; people who write Wordpress themes and plugins\n\n\\* People who physically setup servers -&gt; people who handle AWS\n\n\\* People who washed clothes in a basin by hand -&gt; people who can operate washing machines\n\nEvery company needs a way to stand out from their competitors. They can't do it by simply using the same tools their competition does. Since their competition will have a budget to innovate, they'll need that budget, too. So, even if Company A can continue on their current track with AI tools, Company B is going to add engineers to go beyond what Company A is doing. And since the nature of technology is to innovate, and the nature of all business is to compete, there can never be a scenario where everyone just adopts the same tools and rests on their laurels.\n\nLearn how AI tools can help your velocity, and improve your code's reliability, readability, testability. Even ask it to explain chunks of code that are confusing! Push its limits, and use it to push your own. Because at the end of the day/sprint/PI/quarter or fiscal year, what will matter is how far YOU take it, not how far it goes by itself.",

Baby airlifted to NICU in Reno. Baby &amp; mom seem to be okay so far. \n\nThis quote from the nurse gave me chills: \n\n&gt; \"The hardest part was knowing, as a nurse, what can go wrong,” Ms. O’Reilly said. She added, “Having no resources was frightening.” \n\n&gt; Ms. O’Reilly asked the campers to turn on the heat as she examined the baby’s mouth and airways, checked her coloring and her posture and monitored her breathing. The baby was small, Ms. O’Reilly said, but she had pink coloring and was crying and breathing well, all good signs. Campers found a heated water bottle to help keep the baby warm. Ms. O’Reilly recalled soothing the newborn, saying, “Come on, baby. It’s OK.” \n\nI can't imagine doing emergency neonatal care in the MIDDLE of the DESERT with nothing but a towel &amp; a hot water bottle. So much pressure &amp; so few resources.

      "text": "The Trump administration just halted a nearly completed offshore wind project set to power three hundred fifty thousand homes in Rhode Island and Connecticut, abruptly ending over twelve hundred union jobs. Forty five turbines are already standing, billions invested, but clean local energy has been tossed aside over vague national security claims. The move comes as a shocking setback for communities that spent years working toward affordable green power and a fair transition for workers.\nWhat makes this all the more infuriating is that Trump pledged during his campaign to oil executives that he would block wind and solar projects if re-elected. By sticking to that promise, he's delivered exactly what fossil fuel bosses want, despite the cost to jobs, families, and the climate. The cancellation sends a loud message: prioritize oil companies over clean energy, and ordinary Americans are left picking up the pieces.\nIn total, Trump's presidency has canceled over thirteen billion dollars in green energy projects, hurting working people, driving up utility bills, and undermining climate action across the country. This latest attack not only destroys jobs, but also delays meaningful solutions that help ratepayers and protect communities from extreme weather, all for the benefit of a handful of oil executives.",

      "text": "Support link: https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jumpforhotdogs 🌭\n\nIBEW, this is Jump Shepherd, I’m running for U.S. Senate. The last couple of weeks we’ve been visiting the ICE Detention Facility outside of Chicago. Peaceful, contentious at times, and full of good people. The only problem, there’s no food for protesters and police.\n\nWe want to fix that.\n\nHere’s what we want to do: cook hot dogs for protesters and police in support of our American right to protest and to bring attention to the ICE Facility and its need to go. Our aim is to get good food to the detainees during the holidays.\n\nWe already spoke to the police. No fire or cooking on-site is allowed. So the plan is:\n\t•\tCook beforehand\n\t•\tBring the food in\n\t•\tKeep everything warm at the protest zone\n\n**What we need (and where your support goes):**\n\t•\t500 hot dogs\n\t•\tFull Chicago Dog ingredients\n\t•\tChili\n\t•\tAluminum foil\n\t•\tSelf-serve table\n\t•\tVolunteers/servers\n\t•\tSpeakers + microphone\n\n**🇺🇸 FAQ:**\n\nQ: Is this an IBEW event?\nA: No. But we’re doing it anyway. If you’re a member, or a part of any union, and want to help, all are invited. This is an opportunity for those in here who are passionate and want to support the protests by serving good food to protesters, police, and detainees during the holiday season. We’re reaching out to others outside of the union as well.\n\nQ: You’re running for Senate? What?\nA: Yeah. I’m Jump Shepherd, I’m running for U.S. Senate. I’m a IBEW 134 electrician and I’m running to represent working people. I want to tax billionaires and bring the hoarded wealth at the top down to working people. I want to represent unions in the Senate and take America back from greedy politicians and lobbyists. I’m running for us. I’m running for you, brotha. \n\nQ: What’s your stance on ICE?\nA: I support a humane, service-focused immigration system that ends ICE’s punitive model by banning raids, stopping local police cooperation except for true public safety threats, closing abusive private detention centers, and replacing incarceration with community-based case management programs. I also champion an immigration system that provides a clear, affordable pathway to citizenship for longtime undocumented residents, Dreamers, TPS (temporary protected status) holders, essential workers, and families, expands and modernizes legal immigration, processes asylum claims quickly and fairly without detention, ensures humane border infrastructure, enforces full labor rights regardless of status, and addresses root causes abroad through anti-corruption, economic development, and climate-resilience investments rather than militarization.\n\nQ: Are y’all the ones acting all crazy, attacking police and all that?\nA: No. The hot dog station will be situated pretty far from the intersection between the police and protesters. We’re not getting involved in anything like that, we’re just here to feed hungry protesters and police.\n\nQ: Isn’t the facility very dangerous?\nA: We’ve been a couple times and it’s been chill. There will always be some protesters and counter-protesters looking for action, but we feel sharing a meal will quell the confusion, at least for a day. \n\nQ: Where can I donate to the hot dog fund?\nA: Right here → https://secure.actblue.com/donate/jumpforhotdogs\n\nQ: What is a Chicago dog?\nA: \n- Sesame seed bun\n- All beef frankfurter\n- Yellow mustard\n- Bright green sweet pickle relish\n- Chopped white onion\n- Tomato slices/wedges\n- Dill pickle spear\n- Pickled sport peppers\n- A dash of celery salt\n\nNo ketchup!! ❌\n\nQ: But what if I want ketchup on my Chicago dog?\nA: If you put ketchup on your Chicago dog, people will know you’re not from here.",

He responded, “that’s just what you think.”\n•\t⁠His feedback to our daily stand up was, “Sorry, but I really don’t care about what other people are doing.”\n\nThe second junior who has been with the company for a year-\n\n•\t⁠When I told him that he should prioritize his own growth and take courses to acquire new skills, he just blanked out. I asked him if he knew any learning website such as Coursera or Udemy and he told me he had never heard of them before.\n•\t⁠He constantly complains about the tickets he works on which is our legacy system, but when I offered to talk with our EM to assign him more exciting work which will expand his skill sets, he told me he was not interested in working on the new system which uses modern tech stacks.\n\nI supposed I am just disappointed with these junior devs not only because after all these years, software engineering still gets me excited, but also it’s a joy for me to see juniors grow.

      "text": "Last week, I asked in this sub how to teach real estate to my daughter's class who are 7-8 years old.\n\nMy daughter's teacher asked me to talk to their class regarding real estate. They are writing a paper and there's a real estate portion. They are 7/8 years old so I had to make sure I made it entertaining for them.\n\nThanks to your suggestions - I said that when buying a house, it's like a treasure hunt for the best home. I also told them that realtors are magicians because we can open any realtor lockbox in the area with our phone apps.\n\nDuring the discussion, they learned how to write a cheque and buy and sell houses in different provinces of Canada (currently, they're learning provinces and territories of Canada, they're learning to write in cursive, learn to write #s in words, learn about money which I integrated in writing a cheque). \n\nAt the end of the class, I gave each one of them a certificate that says they're Real Estate Superstar. I signed the certificate with my name on it. I was in their class for 1 hour.\n\nWhen my daughter went home, I received a book of the compilation of the kids' dream home. Most of their dream homes are castles, with pool, with tree house. It's their way of saying thank you to me. But that's not all, \n\nA parent contacted me. They're already pre-approved for financing to buy a home - the next day, we were looking at $1.2 - $1.4M homes and few days later, found the one and already has an accepted offer.\n\nAt this point, I don't see anything is gonna go wrong in our deal - clients are preapproved for much more $ (actually, they can pay cash if they want to so financing will never be an issue), house is built by a reputable builder in 2021 and the price - we got it as a deal - most listings in this area are $100k-$200k more - comparables were $50k-$100k above our accepted offer. My clients were willing to pay the asking price, I offered way less and after back and forth, our offer got accepted. \n\nEDIT: house is officially off market :) we got it! ",

      "text": "**TL;DR: Student with 100+ hours and 5 instructors still couldn’t solo. I told him he didn’t have what it takes. It devastated him and had to explain it again to his parents.**\n\nI had one of those moments recently that I think every flight instructor dreads, and it’s still weighing on me.\n\nThe student in question is a good kid, dedicated, punctual and studious, and with plenty of funds, basically the perfect combo! He’s logged well over 100 hours of dual instruction (closer to 200 actually!) yet has never soloed. He was given to me by his fifth instructor. From the beginning, I tried to give him a fair shot, wiping the slate clean and approaching his training as if I knew nothing about his history. I wanted to see for myself what was really going on.\n\nBut it didn’t take long for the truth to show itself, basically after the third flight. No matter how many times we repeated the fundamentals, I've never saw any coordination, situational awareness, or basic control skills needed to be a safe pilot. Circuits were inconsistent, airspeed management slipped constantly, and his ability to process what was happening around him in the air just wasn’t there. I could correct, coach, and demonstrate, but the connection never stuck. For example, there was no roundout or flare on approach, he fixaxes on the airspeed indicator ignoring everything else and, worst of all, freezes when encountering mild bumps in the air. On the ground he's a totally different person with knowledge almost up to par to a CPL student but in the air, completely the opposite. \n\nAfter a couple of weeks of trying, I had to face reality: this wasn’t just a case of a slow learner, or someone needing a different teaching style. This was someone who simply did not have the aptitude for flying.\n\nI spoke at lenght about him with our chief instructor and asked him if it would be OK to tell him the truth. He agreed as if he already wanted me to ask him that. Guess I was chosen for that job from the start. \n\nSitting him down to tell him was brutal. I chose my words carefully, but there’s no way to soften that kind of truth. I explained that I didn’t see him being able to safely progress toward a certificate. The look on his face when it hit him… it was absolutely devastating. He had poured his time, money, and heart into chasing this dream, and here I was telling him it wasn’t going to happen. Never have I seen a man's heart broken in two like that. \n\nI thought that would be the end of it, but a few days later his parents called me directly. They were confused, even a little upset, and wanted to understand why I had come to that conclusion. I had to go through the same explanation again: over a hundred hours, five different instructors, and still no solo. If that doesn’t speak for itself, nothing will. It wasn’t just about slow progress, it was about safety. Letting him continue would have put both him and others at risk.\n\nFortunately, they agreed. I offered different paths in aviation that he can explore and could be as satisfying as flying. I wanted so much to tell him that in person and wanted more to retract what I said but I knew in my mind it was the right decision even though my heart wanted otherwise. \n\nThis was hands down the hardest conversation of my career because if my instructor came down with this one, it would've broken me in half. Now I'm worried that I might have sent this gentleman straight to therapy because I've recently told he's been very depressed, hopefully he doesn't come to that. ",

      "text": "I am proud to be a wireman. My profession has allowed me to help people and serve my community. Being an electrician is a big part of my identity. I love what I do.\n\nFor the past five years, my job has evolved from installing wires and devices to advocating for the men and women who work in my industry. I represent workers. I am married to my job. It is not easy, it is definitely not healthy, but it is important and often rewarding work.\n\nThe screenshots I shared with this post detail just a portion of an ongoing conversation I’m having with one of the workers I represent. This individual is an immigrant from Haiti. He is in this country legally. He is a fellow dues-paying member organization that I swore an oath to bear true allegiance to. He swore that same oath. He is experienced and credentialed in the installation of solar arrays. He’s my Brother.\n\nEarlier this year, I was tasked to assist in supplying manpower to a contractor in need of help. In the process of doing so, I helped this Brother find a job. It wasn’t necessarily easy. There were obstacles. Misunderstandings. Additional paperwork to file. There were barriers, namely language. But together, we were patient and persistent and we got it done. I didn’t do it alone and by no means do I deserve a ticker-tape parade to be held in my honor or even a goddamn cookie for my efforts, I was just doing my job. But my Haitian friend, he doesn’t see it that way.\n\nRead his texts. You’ll find genuine gratitude. Thankfulness. Honest appreciation. He’s not working an angle. He’s not using hollow flattery to curry favor so I’m more inclined to hook him up in the future. It’s sincere and it’s real. He was never looking for a handout. He was only searching for an opportunity to earn a fair wage performing dignified and valuable work. Not only does he work hard, he also acknowledged that he would pay it forward every chance he got. He’s not “taking our jobs”, he’s doing his job alongside us.\n\nYesterday, the Department of Homeland Security announced it has begun notifying hundreds of thousands of Haitians, Cubans, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans that their temporary permission to live and work legally in the United States has been revoked and that they should leave the country. I’m not yet certain how this announcement will immediately affect the Haitian workers I represent. Some may hold an alternate classification of protected legal status. But even the foreign workers who have been here the longest are at risk for deportation, as DHS Secretary Noem has shortened the deadlines and limited resources to file for legal extensions. It’s unlikely there’s a future in the States for these workers, and that sucks.\n\nI’m not an immigration lawyer or a policymaker, I’m just a wireman. But I’m also a human with a heart. I know good people when I meet them. I know the recent cruel and bitter treatment of nearly all immigrant workers, both legal and undocumented, is misplaced. I know ICE’s targeting of legal workers at job sites and courthouses is immoral as f#@k. I also know there isn’t a whole hell of a lot I can do about it, but staying silent isn’t an option. We must stand up for our fellow workers. This is a moment for solidarity. We have a right to speak out and protest. If we don’t use it, we’ll lose it.\n\nOur Haitian IBEW Brothers and Sisters would share stories about their homeland with their American coworkers during lunch breaks. They’d show them their bullet wounds and scars from injuries they suffered while protecting their families and neighbors from gang violence. At the moment, Haiti is a humanitarian nightmare. Whelp, the good ole U S of A is sending them back. Not just the criminals, either. All of ‘em. In defense of their actions, our elected leaders will scream, “America first!” I’m just wondering… first at what?\n\nDo something.",

These are positions that mostly involve imaging new builds, replacing broken keyboards, changing out toner cartridges, occasionally patching in a network drop, etc. The positions pay $36.5k / year. Granted it's in a LCOL area in the Midwest, but still.\n\nSo I'm flipping through this stack of 20+ resumes on his desk, and it's all recent college grads, or post high school with A+ - basically, exactly the resumes you would expect for a position that *you, yourself,* are calling \"entry level\".\n\nNope! He want's someone with *at least* six years of experience and a four year degree or multiple progressive certs. For $36k a year. To change out toner cartridges and plug in keyboards. We've all heard of companies like that, but I guess I'd just never come face-to-face with that line of thinking.... Honestly didn't even know what to say.\n\nEDIT: For everyone asking: The next time we're sitting around drinking beers on his porch, I'll have no problem tell him he's a fucking idiot.

And it moves in this… odd kind of way… and it does the same kind of movement over and over again. Odd, but I keep going. At one point this…  agent…. Talks for about 2 min straight without taking a single breath or even sounding short of breath, which was incredibly jarring. \n\nThen we get into the actual technical exercise. I ask them to find a small bug in some python code that is just making a very simple API call. It’s a small syntax error, very basic, easy to miss but running the script and reading the error message spells it out for you. This agent starts explaining that the defect is due to a failure to authenticate with this api endpoint, which is not true at all. But the agent starts going into GREAT detail on how rest authentication works using oAuth tokens (which it wasn’t even using), and how that is the issue. Without even trying to run it. \n\nSo I ask “interesting can you walk me through the code and explain how you identified that as the issue?” And it just repeats everything it just said a minute ago. I ask it again to try and explain the code to me and to fix the code. It starts saying the same thing a third time, then it drops entirely from the call. \n\n\nSo I spent about 30 minutes today talking to someone’s scammer AI agent who somehow got their way past the basic HR screening. \n\nThis is the world we are living in. \n\nThis is not an advertisement for a position, please don’t ask me about the position, the intent of this post is just to share this experience with other professionals and raise some awareness to be careful with these interviews.

If you’ve been in the industry for a while, you enjoy it as a career and you feel like going to culinary school, this isn’t for you. \n\nThis question is asked all of the time, should I go to culinary school. My two cents, absolutely not. First things first, return on investment is very low. Secondly, it doesn’t matter if you’ve gone to the culinary institute of America, you’re not going to start out as a sous chef. You’ll be at the very bottom, same as the guy who didn’t go to culinary school and within 2 years you’ll both have the same knowledge database, assuming the other guy is passionate and asks questions, except he won’t be in debt. \n\nI’ve seen literally no exaggeration hundreds of culinary school graduates who start in a restaurant and nope the fuck out within a few months, then switch to a different career. See if it’s actually what you want to do first, at least. It’s not like what you’re probably imagining. The hours are grueling, the pay is shit unless you land a good corporate gig, rarely will you find benefits or paid time off, holidays are gone, your coworkers will know you better than your family. With that said, obviously people do this for a reason, including myself. That reason is passion. It’s easy to have passion for cooking when you aren’t a cook. You may love making a dish using chicken thighs, but stand in one spot for 3 hours cutting chicken thighs and tell me how you feel about chicken thighs. I promise the answer is fuck those chicken thighs lol. You love making cheesecake, so do I, I’m a slut for cheesecake, but I’ve made thousands of them and my view on the subject is probably less romanticized. \n\nBe a chef, by all means, we welcome you with open arms.

And they want to pay you like you just learned how to reset a router.\n\nIt’s a never-ending grind of certs, degrees, and “keeping your skills sharp” just to stay in the same place. Half the stuff you’re pressured to learn? You’ll never even touch it in the real world. Just fluff to tick a box on a job listing.\n\nRespect? Forget it. You’re invisible when things work and public enemy #1 when Karen’s printer won’t connect. Everyone’s got jokes until the network goes down — then suddenly you’re supposed to be a magician. People laugh when I say I work in IT.\n\nAnd moving up? Good luck. It’s less about skill and more about kissing the right ass. Office politics and fake enthusiasm get you further than real knowledge. You could be carrying the whole team, and still get passed over.\n\nI hope this offends a few nerds who think they’ve “made it” — maybe you need a wake-up call too.

About two or so years ago I got a new manager that taught me about brag documents, basically you fill it out through out the year to have all your accomplishments in one document. We did monthly summaries, every month I’d fill out what I did for the month and send it to my manager. It helped a lot during last year’s performance review.

      "title": "I flew 1500 Miles in a Cessna 152 - Here's what I learned",
      "text": "**Intro / Trip Summary**\n\nI just got back from a six-day, 20-leg, VFR cross-country flight covering over 1,500 miles in a Cessna 152—with a licensed pilot friend.\n\nWhile planning this trip, I struggled to find first-hand accounts or detailed write-ups from people who had done something similar. So now that I'm back on the ground, I wanted to share a full debrief: what happened, what went smoothly, what didn’t, and what I’d do differently next time.\n\n**Personal Background**\n\nI’m a 22-year-old engineering student at a university in Southern Ontario. I’ve been fascinated by aviation since I was a kid and always knew I wanted to become a pilot someday. But with no family background in aviation and limited exposure growing up, it didn’t feel like a realistic path at first.\n\nThat changed in high school when I took an aviation technology class, which essentially covered the PPL ground school. By the end of the year, we even had the chance to write the private pilot written exam.\n\nOnce I started university, I got a part-time job loading bags at Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport (CYTZ), and used that opportunity to enroll in the flight school there. I earned my license toward the end of 2022 and had about 110 hours logged before setting off on this trip.\n\n**Overview: Why We Did This Trip, Aircraft &amp; Equipment**\n\nThe deeper I got into general aviation, the more I became drawn to the freedom that Part 91 flying offers. The idea of taking a multi-day, road trip–style journey in a small plane started to sound more and more appealing.\n\nThe opportunity came when a friend of mine bought a 1980 Cessna 152 to build time. The aircraft is pretty barebones—with just the standard six-pack and a Garmin GNS 430 as our only piece of glass. For backup navigation, we had ADS-B In feeding to an iPad, which gave us the magenta line and real-time traffic.\n\nTogether, we’d already done a handful of $100 hamburger runs and had visited most of the airports in Southern Ontario. So we figured: why not take it further and expand our flying into the United States?\n\n# How We Planned the Trip &amp; What We Wanted to Accomplish\n\nThe main goal of the trip was to go sightseeing over New York City. I’d read about the SFRA and, after digging deeper, realized that while it’s a cool experience, the *Skyline Route* offers even better views of Manhattan—so we planned to fly both.\n\nSince we had a few extra days to work with, we decided to stretch the trip down to North Carolina to land at First Flight Airport. Flying into the same spot where the Wright Brothers made history felt like the ultimate bragging right.\n\nIn a perfect world, the trip would take four days of flying. We’d clear customs and head to NYC on day one, fly the Skyline Route, and wrap up the day at Essex County Airport (KCDW) in New Jersey. Day two would start with the Hudson River SFRA, followed by a scenic flight down the Atlantic coast to First Flight Airport (KFFA) in North Carolina. Then we’d take two days to make our way back home, stopping at an airport somewhere in central Pennsylvania along the way.\n\nIn the end, the route formed a rough triangle: Toronto → New York → Kitty Hawk → home.\n\n# Dealing with CBP (Briefly)...\n\nI’ll keep this short since it probably won’t apply to most people reading this, but for anyone planning to cross the border: there are plenty of YouTube videos that walk you through the process step by step.\n\nOne key requirement before entering the U.S. is submitting an eAPIS form and calling the CBP port of entry to secure landing rights. In my case, I ran into a bit of a bureaucratic headache. The first agent I spoke to denied my landing rights because he insisted I upload three separate documents into just two text fields—which, of course, isn’t possible. He told me that if I couldn’t “figure it out,” he’d continue to deny every future request I submitted.\n\nThankfully, when I called again the next morning, a different agent reviewed the exact same request and approved it without issue. In my opinion, the system shouldn’t be this inconsistent or dependent on who happens to pick up the phone.\n\n# Sightseeing NYC - Skyline Route\n\n**​​**We departed our home airport near Toronto around 9 AM, and clearing customs at Buffalo was quick and straightforward. Since I did most of my flight training at a Canadian airport equivalent to Class Bravo, and I had done plenty of prep for flying into Class C airspace, the radio work felt familiar and manageable. Splitting duties also helped—a lot. I handled the radios while my friend focused on flying, which simplified the workload. \n\nWe continued east, cutting across New York State over the Finger Lakes and south of the Catskills. Approaching NYC from the west, we aimed a bit further north up the Hudson and stopped at Orange County Airport (KMGJ) to refuel. We landed around 4 PM and decided to wait for the sun to get lower on the horizon to catch NYC in that golden-hour light. We ended up departing around 5:30 PM. Ideally, we would’ve waited even longer—timing our Statue of Liberty fly-by with the sunset—but since neither of us has a night rating (Canadian PPLs don’t include night flying by default), we had to wrap things up before dark.\n\nAfter takeoff, we headed south and joined the Hudson over Highland Falls, just south of West Point. I wanted to try for the Skyline Route, so I called up NY Approach. Crickets. Tried again. Still nothing. I’ll admit—I felt pretty deflated, especially when I could hear her talking to the big boys and just ignored me. Flying over Central Park and down the East River was high on my list. But then I remembered: I could try LaGuardia Tower directly once we got closer.\n\nApproaching the Alpine Tower, I called up LGA Tower, explained our intentions—and to my surprise, we were immediately told:\n\n\"Cleared into Bravo. Proceed down the East River via the Central Park transition.\"\n\nIt was absolutely stunning. The sun was casting golden light across the skyscrapers as we flew alongside them. As we turned south down the East River, we were instructed to climb to 2,000 feet. My friend was flying while I managed the radio and snapped photos. Somewhere over the East Village, Manhattan juts eastward toward the river, and apparently we drifted a bit off track. LGA quickly reminded us to “keep it over the river.” In situations like that, it’s best to just acknowledge, apologize, and move on—everyone appreciates humility.\n\nWe were handed off to Newark Tower as we crossed the Brooklyn Bridge and continued south down the Hudson at 2,000 feet. Upon reaching the north shore of Staten Island, I contacted the tower to drop below the Bravo shelf and transition into the SFRA. Clearance was granted.\n\nThat evening, we circled the Statue of Liberty three times. It was peaceful, surreal—and somehow, we were the only aircraft in the pattern. To slow us down, my friend even dropped 10 degrees of flaps. After soaking in the view, we continued up the Hudson, making the standard SFRA callouts, and ended the day at Essex County Airport (KCDW).\n\n# Flying the Hudson SFRA the Next Morning\n\nThe next morning, we departed KCDW and headed northeast toward the Tappan Zee Bridge, then turned south to re-enter the Hudson SFRA at 1,000 feet. This time, things were *much* busier. I was flying this leg and working the radio while my friend was tasked with taking photos—but he ended up glued to the iPad, scanning for traffic on ADS-B instead.\n\nAs we circled the Statue again, now at 900 feet, we spotted *six* helicopters orbiting at 600 feet; first on the ipad, then out the windows. That scared the living sh\\*t out of me. Not wanting to make the national news, we climbed up and continued circling at 1,000 feet. After one more lap, we decided we’d gotten enough of the view—and enough of the adrenaline.\n\n**Communication, Busy Airspace, and Flight Following**\n\nNow that I’ve done more flying out of non-towered fields, I get how some pilots can go years without ever talking to ATC. But for this trip, we made the decision to request flight following on any leg longer than 40 miles, as an added layer of safety.\n\nAt first, I figured the main benefit of flight following was emergency-related—if something went wrong, I could key the mic and be instantly in contact with someone, without scrambling for frequencies. And of course, it helps with traffic separation and reducing the risk of mid-air collisions.\n\nBut what I came to appreciate most was how much more comfortable it made me when operating near or through controlled airspace. For example, on our way back north, we flew over Norfolk, Virginia—a corridor packed with five different airports along our route. Being on flight following meant I didn’t need to worry about initiating contact with every single facility along the way. I could just fly, knowing two-way communication was already established.\n\nWhen it comes to talking with ATC, it all goes back to something I was told by a veteran Marine pilot I met on this trip: “If you talk like a big boy, they’ll treat you like a big boy.” Staying professional and confident on the radio really does make things smoother.\n\n**Weather Delays:**\n\nFlying north toward home, our flight path took us out of Tappahannock Airport (KXSA), heading northwest. Looking at the weather, I knew we weren’t going to make it to our planned destination in Winchester (KOKV). I also wasn’t comfortable with the idea of scud running through the mountains, so we decided to cut the flight short and land at Shannon Airport in Fredericksburg (KEZF) instead.\n\nBy the time we took off from KXSA, clouds and rain cells were already moving in. Once airborne and with updated ADS-B weather, we spotted a red cell to the southwest. I’ve heard the saying, ‘green gets rid of the bugs, yellow chips the paint, and red starts removing parts,’ so I wanted nothing to do with that cell. About five minutes into the flight, we realized it was moving perpendicular to our route. After some rough mental math, we figured we could beat it to our destination and land before it crossed our path—so we chose not to turn back.\n\nFortunately, we made it with margin to spare. By the time we joined the pattern at KEZF, the skies were blue again. Although the weather never deteriorated to IMC, our windshield did get wet as we flew through light showers.\n\nWe ended up grounded in Fredericksburg, Virginia, due to lingering weather. We arrived in the afternoon, and the forecast looked poor for the rest of the day and the following one. The third day, however, showed promise. I had friends in the area who came to visit, and the two days passed quickly.\n\nOn the night of the second day, while checking the forecast for our planned departure, we noticed a 17-knot crosswind on takeoff and gusty conditions expected all the way home. To this day, I still can’t believe I told my friend, “I’ve flown in worse.” That right there is why accident rates spike for pilots with 100 to 300 hours—classic Dunning-Kruger effect: you don’t know what you don’t know.\n\nI’m grateful my friend convinced me to rent a car, drive to DC, and depart a day later.\n\nI take pride in being a safety-conscious pilot. Since earning my license, I’ve been an avid listener of podcasts like *I Learned About Flying From That* and AOPA’s *There I Was*, and I’ve watched every Blancolirio video ever posted. I know it’s always better to be on the ground wishing you were in the air than in the air wishing you were on the ground—but in this case, “get-there-itis” crept into my thinking.\n\n**Aviation Community and the Help We Received:**\n\nThe airport courtesy car was something I had never experienced before—and it’s truly one of the gems of the GA world. Since airports are often located a bit outside of town, many offer courtesy cars for transient pilots to drive into town for food or errands. We ended up using this privilege twice, and it made our trip significantly smoother. I hope future generations of GA pilots use these cars responsibly, top off the gas tank with a few bucks, and help keep this tradition alive.\n\nI don’t know if it was because our aircraft stood out with a Canadian registration, but we had a lot of people come up and talk to us throughout the trip. More than once, we were asked, “Did you actually fly that thing down from Canada?” Conversations with fellow pilots often led to helpful advice. At Orange County Airport near New York City, a pilot confirmed the procedures for flying the Skyline Route and the East River Transition. At Shannon Airport (KEZF) in Virginia, a pilot in his 1960s pickup truck pulled up and offered us a ride into town—without us even asking. And when we experienced engine trouble at First Flight Airport (KFFA), a Bonanza pilot walked over and helped us troubleshoot the issue.\n\nI’ve heard people talk about how special the GA community is—how it’s an exclusive space where knowledge is shared and help is freely offered. On this trip, I experienced that firsthand. As more people join this community, I hope we continue to uphold that spirit: being kind, generous, and helpful to one another for generations to come.\n\nLastly, I want to express my gratitude to the air traffic controllers who helped keep the skies safe. As I mentioned earlier, we picked up flight following on any leg over 40 miles, and every time, we were granted our VFR request. The only exception was NY Approach, who didn’t respond when we requested the Skyline Route—but that’s understandable given how busy that airspace is.\n\nI know it adds work for controllers to gather our aircraft type, altitude, destination, and then hand us off to the next facility. So I truly appreciate the coast-to-coast radar coverage and the willingness of controllers to provide flight following to a little Cessna 152. A special shoutout goes to the towers at LGA and EWR for coordinating the Skyline Route, East River, and Central Park Transitions. After returning home, I saw on the news that EWR was facing significant delays due to a runway closure. Yet, their tower still accommodated our request and allowed us to fly in their Bravo airspace—an experience I’ll never forget.\n\n**Technical Delays:**\n\nAfter our overnight stay at the Wright Brothers National Memorial in Kitty Hawk, we planned for a short-field takeoff from Runway 3, mindful of the power lines at the departure end. During the run-up, we experienced a significant RPM drop on the left magneto, and the engine ran noticeably rough. We immediately knew flying wasn’t an option. We shut down and called Dare County Airport (KMQI), located just across the Roanoke Sound, about seven miles away. The staff there took my number and said they’d contact a local A&amp;P mechanic on our behalf.\n\nAbout 20 minutes later, I got a call from the mechanic. He was working on another aircraft at an airport 50 miles away but said he’d come over as soon as he wrapped up. Sure enough, around 30 minutes later, a Cessna 172 landed—and out stepped the A&amp;P.\n\nWe tried running the engine at full power while leaning aggressively to heat the cylinders and burn off any carbon buildup, but it didn’t solve the issue. The mechanic flew back to his home base to retrieve tools and a couple of spark plugs. Once he returned, we pulled off the cowling and removed the four spark plugs associated with the left magneto. One of them was heavily fouled, with significant carbon buildup on the electrode. Rather than clean it, we opted to replace the plug entirely.\n\nThe fix didn’t take long. Soon, I started the engine and ran a mag check—this time, the left magneto only showed about a 100 RPM drop. Problem solved.\n\n\n\n**Things I Would Have Done Differently:**\n\n**Planning for Headwinds:**\n\nWe got lucky on this trip. We had a 15-knot tailwind on our flight from near Toronto to New York City, and another 10-knot tailwind on the return from Northern Virginia. Not only did the tailwinds increase our ground speed, but they also allowed us to climb higher, helping us harvest better winds and gain altitude margins for safety.\n\nHypothetically, though, if the winds had been reversed, I’m not sure we would have made it to our destination on time. On future trips, I’ll pay closer attention to wind forecasts—not just for flight time estimates, but for their broader impact on safety, fuel range, and alternate planning. Strong headwinds can turn a well-planned flight into a fuel management problem very quickly.\n\n**Get home/there itis:**\n\nThere were two clear instances of get-there-itis on this trip. The decision to race the storm to KEZF was influenced in part by knowing I had friends in Fredericksburg—and by the fact that KXSA felt isolated. Additionally, during a call with Flight Service 90 minutes earlier, I was told that local conditions looked okay. But it's important to remember: the briefer is on the ground, and we’re in the air. They can’t see what we see, or feel what we feel. Also, it is important to remember that the information is 90 minutes old, and that the weather is dynamic. Next time, I’ll consider their input, but remember that the final decision—and its consequences—rests with the Pilot in Command.\n\nI’m also disappointed in myself for seriously considering a takeoff with a 17-knot crosswind. Yes, I’ve flown in worse, and I probably could have handled it, but that’s not the point. Just because you *can* doesn’t mean you *should*. As a low-time pilot, I need to be vigilant about my decision-making and constantly remind myself of the Dunning-Kruger effect: I don’t know what I don’t know. The goal isn’t just to handle challenging conditions—it’s to make good enough decisions to reach 300 hours safely one day.\n\n**Check them NOTAMS**\n\nOn our flight from Accomack County Airport (KMFV) to Currituck County Airport (KONX), I forgot to check the NOTAMs before departing. I only discovered that the airport had no fuel after tuning in to the AWOS frequency before landing.\n\nThankfully, I had planned conservatively and had more than enough fuel to reach the next airport 40 miles away—with a 30-minute legal reserve *in addition to* my personal 45-minute minimum. Still, it was a preventable oversight. Next time, I’ll make checking NOTAMs a non-negotiable part of every preflight.\n\n**Flying Right After an Annual**\n\nWinter weather in Ontario kept me grounded for months. To prepare for this trip, I flew with an instructor and had the aircraft go through its annual inspection. But when we spoke with others along the way, we kept hearing the same advice: it’s not a great idea to launch a long cross-country flight right after an annual.\n\nIn hindsight, I agree. Next time, I’d fly the plane locally for a while—do some laps around the pattern, take it on a few short hops—just to shake out any post-maintenance gremlins before committing to an extended journey.",

      "text": "[https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/legal-news/appeals-court-upholds-landmark-75m-verdict-against-radiologist-er-doc](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/legal-news/appeals-court-upholds-landmark-75m-verdict-against-radiologist-er-doc)\n\nAn appeals court recently upheld a “landmark” $75 million verdict against a radiologist and emergency physician, plaintiff attorneys announced Tuesday. \n\nThe case dates back nearly a decade, to October 2015, when Jonathan Buckelew collapsed while receiving chiropractic care for his neck. He was transported to a hospital leading to a series of negligent events, *Radiology Business* reported [previously](http://radiologybusiness.com/topics/patient-care/75m-malpractice-verdict-splits-fault-between-er-doctor-radiologist).\n\nEmergency imaging showed Buckelew, 32 at the time, suffered a brainstem stroke—a diagnosis that should have prompted immediate treatment. However, his attorneys argued that the care team failed to reach a definitive diagnosis until the patient’s second day in the hospital. During the protracted wait, Buckelew’s brain was so severely damaged that he is now permanently stricken with “[locked-in syndrome](https://rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/locked-in-syndrome/#:~:text=Locked%2Din%20syndrome%20is%20a,the%20movements%20of%20the%20eyes.),” rendering him unable to feel or control any voluntary muscle groups except those of his eyes.\n\nA jury sided with the man in 2022, awarding $46 million in civil damages and $29 million in medical expenses. About 60% of the sum was pinned on the EM physician, and 40% on the radiologist, while other clinicians were cleared. \n\n**Matthew Womack, MD, an emergency doc at North Fulton Hospital at the time, fought the decision.** But a Georgia Court of Appeals affirmed the $40 million ruling against him on March 10. **Plaintiff attorneys believe this is the largest ER malpractice verdict in the state’s history.** \n\n“This decision is a victory not just for Jonathan Buckelew and his family, but for patient safety in Georgia,” Lloyd Bell, founding partner of [Bell Law Firm](https://cts.businesswire.com/ct/CT?id=smartlink&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belllawfirm.com%2F&amp;esheet=54228022&amp;newsitemid=20250325615172&amp;lan=en-US&amp;anchor=Bell+Law+Firm&amp;index=3&amp;md5=271bf87a7c29a641c2c592d0390104e2) and co-counsel in the case, said in a [statement](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250325615172/en/Georgia-Court-of-Appeals-Affirms-Record-Verdict-in-Locked-in-Syndrome-Case) shared March 25. “The court of appeals has made it clear that emergency room physicians must be held accountable when their actions—or inaction—lead to catastrophic harm.”\n\nBell Law emphasized that the ruling “upholds this verdict in full.” According to court [documents](http://belllawfirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/25-03-10-Opinion.pdf), radiologist James Waldschmidt, MD, also appealed but later filed a notice that Buckelew’s claims against him “had been resolved,” and he withdrew. \n\nWaldschmidt’s attorney had previously pointed the jury to evidence showing the radiologist read Buckelew’s imaging “with an eye to answering the specific question” of whether one of his arteries was torn. The attorney had compared a stroke to a forest fire.\n\n“\\[Waldschmidt’s\\] job is not to go down there and put \\[the fire\\] out,” the radiologist’s attorney said previously. “His job is to identify the smoke, and he did that.”\n\nA 10-year case. Since this was lost on appeal I assume this means bankruptcy and asset loss for the ER doc. Name dragged through the mud online. I wouldn't be surprised if he was experiencing SI. I know I would.\n\nWhat a f\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*g clown world.\n\nGeorgia has no cap on non-economic damages. Think about that when picking a state to practice medicine in.",

Then the line went dead.\n\nRedial. Straight to voicemail.\n\nI kept repeating the sound he’d made, trying to find the shape of the word. My partner said:\n“Hathoway Park?”\n\nYes. Yes.

      "text": "I finished my private pilot certificate in August after a nonlinear 5 years of training. I had instructors quit, airplanes quit, the world quit (Covid), schools close, and more in my process of obtaining my certificate. Medical was a breeze, training, when it happened, was a ton of fun, I passed everything with flying colors (pun fully intended) and walked away a pilot with a cast of new friends. Immediately did my tailwheel endorsement. Have some seaplane time. Aerobatic training. I was all about flying once I made the time for it. I shopped for an airplane for those entire 5 years. Once I had my PPL in had I pulled the trigger on a beautiful, restored, 1947 Cessna 140 with a boatload of STCs. It is about as cool as a 140 can be. However, since I purchased it I have only flown it once. I did my insurance required time with a CFI. Had a fresh annual completed on it. Fixed every discrepancy on the aircraft and bought full covers for it. It is 100% ready to fly and I just, don’t. The weather has been a bitch in the Appalachian mountains since I purchased it. But on the nice days, I find myself not drawn to fly. I’m curious if anyone else has experienced the same and had any input even if you haven’t experienced this. ",

      "text": "I'm not against him using AI to write code (even though the code he produces clashes with the style, is harder to review, and has been known to not actually solve the bugs.) Given English is not his first language, and he isn't the best written communicator, I'm glad he's finding a tool that enables him to be productive.\n\nHowever, sometimes I'll spend 20 minutes writing a comment on his PR... giving context to some niche code path, how it interacts with other code paths, verbally retracing the conditions that can produce the bug, linking to historical commits helping us both understand the recent changes, etc.\n\nThen I'll get back 5 paragraphs of perfect English with a jovial tone saying my points are *so* valid and here's why my coworker made this change, and this and that...\n\n&gt;Thanks for the detailed feedback and for raising these points. I've looked through the logic, and I think we're on the same page. Here’s a breakdown of how this change fits in with your observations.\n\n&gt;You're absolutely right about the intended system behavior, especially regarding the FooClass workflow and how our SQL query is supposed to handle errors. The core issue we're hitting is a subtle race condition that causes a panic before our self-healing logic can engage.\n\n&gt;The \"Stuck Bar\" Problem &amp; FooClass: Your instinct is correct the foo.error IS NULL check in our query is designed to prevent exactly the kind of loop you described (link). The problem is that the current code panics before it ever gets a chance to call executeBaz(). Because the error state is never saved to the database, the query picks up the same problematic record on every run, leading to a crash loop.\n\n&gt;\\[Three more paragraphs\\]\n\n&gt;In short, this change is a defensive fix that ensures our state is updated correctly, allowing the rest of our robust logic (like the SQL query) to function as intended. It addresses the immediate panic while still validating your points about the overall system design.\n\nClearly my coworker took my painstaking reply, fed it into some model with a prompt like \"reply to this\", and copy/pasted it back.\n\nNow instead of trying to work through the language barrier, I'm forced to interact with yet another chatbot instead of a human.\n\nThe future is here and I hate it.",

      "title": "I’m told that our “engineering-focused” culture is offputting to women",
      "text": "I’m a computational scientist working at a biotech company at a level equivalent to a Principal/Staff IC at a software company. The world of scientific computing is famous for shoddy software: think one-off Python/R scripts with a single 10k line `__main__()` function, zero version control, and no semblance of engineering or coding rigor. While this is the unfortunate norm in most of academia and industry, the computational biology division of my company differentiates itself by eschewing this trend and acting like a real tech company. We take pride in having a very well-engineered codebase, and it’s a large factor in the company’s success in a very competitive market. The company’s customers consistently tell us that we have the best software and analytical methods in the field, which is a big reason why they use our products.\n\nThe computational biology division is about 90% men. About 25% of our hires are women, but their tenure at the company is much shorter than men’s (median of 2.5 years, compared with 5.5 years for men). A VP at the company (“Velma”) was tasked with improving this attrition discrepancy, and she met 1:1 with all senior members of the division, including myself.\n\nVelma told me that the reasons women give for leaving are not the usual suspects, like bro-y culture, intellectual dismissal, outright sexism, etc. Instead, she said that the overwhelming reason women are dissatisfied is our focus on “engineering minutiae” (her exact words). She gave an example of an interaction I had with “Susan” on our team. Susan wrote a tool that used O(n^(2)) memory, which worked fine on test data but blew up on real data. Rather than implement a simple algorithmic fix that would let it run in O(n) memory, Susan’s solution was to just provision a VM with a ludicrous amount of RAM (&gt;1 TB). I was responsible for reviewing her code, and she pushed back when I told her this would be unacceptable for production use. (Her pushback was along the lines of “the biggest AWS VM has 32 TB of RAM, so until we hit that I don’t see any problem.”) Furthermore, according to Velma, Susan was actually very upset that I asked her to implement the O(n) fix, feeling that I was “trying to run circles around her by showing off my knowledge of obscure CS trivia.” That said, Susan did not directly voice this displeasure to me, and with some guidance, ended up implementing the fix. Her tool now runs great in production. \n\nMy 1:1 with Velma was eye-opening. Thinking back, there is a definite pattern of women on the team writing code that is generally scientifically sound but poor from an engineering/CS standpoint. I did not realize that women specifically were consistently being put off when asked to address these problems. (The opposite problem crops up with some men on the team, whose code is overoptimized and overengineered to the point of unmaintainability. From what I can tell, they are not upset when asked to simplify things — the worst reaction I heard was something along the lines of “that was a bloody clever piece of code and it’s a pity people aren’t willing to take the time to understand it.”)\n\nVelma agreed wholeheartedly that we would not change our rigorous engineering standards, and that there is no quick-fix to this problem. She just asked that I be aware of it, and reflect over the coming months over potential ways we can address it. Given the fairly nuanced and levelheaded takes I’ve seen here on gender issues in tech, I thought I’d ask this sub for any advice or experience. Thanks so much!\n\nEdit: Thanks for all the great replies! Lots of things to think about. One common thread I want to address: I've seen several comments saying that this is jumping to conclusions based on a one-off anecdote. I only listed the Susan story as an example; Velma gave several other such examples, so she's not basing her conclusions on a one-off. Velma is being extremely rigorous about identifying this as a systemic problem; she went through transcripts of all of the division's exit interviews over the last few years, and interviewed multiple current team members.",

      "text": "I am a student pilot with roughly 8-9 hours of flight time in a C172 N/M. Have been working on clean/dirty configuration stalls and having a blast. \n\nAbout a week ago I did a preflight, noticed the oil dip stick was so hot I could barely touch it and the oil level seemed high/hard to read. Mentioned this to the CFI and we talked about it, the plane had just landed and the temp on the ground was 25C so no cause for concern. \n\nLog book mentioned oil was added recently. \n\nEverything looked good, we load up and continue the checks, notice the oil pressure is low but at 1500RPM it’s in the green. I don’t think this is anything out of the ordinary thus far in my very limited experience. \n\nI taxi, rolling check, run up, hold short, immediate take off as there is another plane just about to turn base from downwind. \n\nTake off is pretty normal, T and Ps in the green, hit 55kts, rotate. Climb is slower than I’m use to but most likely due to temperature. \nAfter hitting 1200ft my CFI asks me to check the oil temp. It’s in the green but very high. Almost in the red, complicating this the oil pressure is fluctuating between below green and slightly in the green. \n\nMy CFI calls out that he has control as this seems like a recipe for engine failure. Sure enough a few minutes later the engine started sputtering and we lost a lot of power. \nWe gained back some altitude, and essentially made a direct line to the runway, came in high and pretty fast, CFI dumped flaps to 40 and touched down. I was blown away by how calm my CFI was. Doing checks, communicating etc. Bit bumpy but we were down. Sigh of relief. \n\nWe taxi and perform after landing checks. Start taxiing back to tie down and the plane just completely dies. Had to tow it back and get a lift in a truck back to the flight school. \n\nI haven’t heard anything on the root cause, but I’m slightly nervous to fly again. Feel pretty lucky I have such a great CFI. \n\nHas anyone else experienced engine failure early on in training and any tips to overcome the nervousness? I was feeling pretty confident prior to this event. \n\n\n",

      "text": "Link to the original post if you didn't see it before ⬇️\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/s/3X5s1UgV30 the\n\n\nSo here's a fun little update. First of all, I already found a much better job so I'm jumping ship immediately like everyone commenting on the original post was saying. But today I found this notice just sitting right on top of the printer in the office. Given the balance due, I can only assume he hasn't been paying the lease at all since we opened. I don't care about professionalism anymore because this man who has the audacity to call himself a \"chef\" doesn't know the meaning of the word. People who fuck up this badly in this industry deserve to be outed for the sake of all the people whose livelihoods they disrupt. \n\nTo recap, the \"famous award-winning chef\" Matt Horn managed his multiple restaurants so badly that he couldn't pay his employees, his vendor, and now his rent on time. Barely 4 months after opening his Elk Grove location, we're already about to get shut down because his obsession with being a restauranteur has prevented him from paying for his existing locations. Instead of just being happy with having one or two popular, profitable, well-managed locations, he decided to open multiple locations at once in cities that are HOURS away from each other.\n\nHe's been dumping all our money (yes, our money, because we haven't been getting paid on time) into opening a location in Fresno because that's his hometown apparently. If you aren't familiar with Fresno California, it is a certified shit hole. And it's a 3-hour drive from the Elk Grove location. Fresno is hardly what one would consider to be a culinary tourism destination. But yeah, it makes perfect business sense to open an expensive BBQ restaurant in the crime-riddled, drug-infested armpit of California. I'm sure all those people doing the fent fold outside the front door of the new restaurant will draw huge crowds!\n\nIf Matt sees this, I want him to know he has no business being in our industry. You were a retail salesman who decided he wanted to cook, and you got lucky on social media where you can construct and influencer narrative to make yourself look good. Just because you can smoke some meat and post a cool video doesn't make you a Chef. Chef is a title you earn after years of hard work and experience in our industry. You never worked your way up like a real Chef. You never worked in any real restaurants at all. You never even bothered to learn the most basic business practices necessary for running a restaurant properly. You don't get to hurt your employees by making them late on their rent and car payments. You're a joke. You wear big your stupid cowboy hat and sit out there in the dining room doing social media interviews acting like you're some hot shot while your employees, vendors, and landlord are all asking where the hell their money is. Shame on you, Matt. Shame. Do our entire industry a favor and sell your locations, cut your losses, and get a job as a line cook in a real restaurant so so you can learn how restaurants are supposed to be run. \n\nAnyway, thanks for letting me rant. Hope you guys enjoyed it. I'm washing my hands of Horn BBQ and \"award-winning chef\"  Matt Horn. I'm not even going to bother following him to see his career crash because I can already see the trajectory. ",

      "text": "Long-time lurker here. Closing in on 32 years in the field.\n\nPosting this after seeing the steady stream of AI threads claiming programming will soon be obsolete or effortless. I think those discussions miss the point.\n\nFred Brooks wrote in the 1980s that no single breakthrough will make software development 10x easier (“No Silver Bullet”). Most of the difficulty lies in the problem itself, not in the tools. The hard part is the essential complexity of the requirements, not the accidental complexity of languages, frameworks, or build chains.\n\nCoding is the boring/easy part. Typing is just transcribing decisions into a machine. The real work is upstream: understanding what’s needed, resolving ambiguity, negotiating tradeoffs, and designing coherent systems. By the time you’re writing code, most of the engineering is (or should be) already done.\n\nThat’s the key point often missed when people talk about vibe coding, no-code, low-code, etc.\n\nOnce requirements are fully expressed, their information content is fixed. You can change surface syntax, but you can’t compress semantics without losing meaning. Any further “compression” means either dropping obligations or pushing missing detail back to a human.\n\nSo when people say “AI will let you just describe what you want and it will build it,” they’re ignoring where the real cost sits. Writing code isn’t the cost. Specifying unambiguous behavior is. And AI can guess it as much or as little as we can.\n\nIf vibe coding or other shorthand feels helpful, that’s because we’re still fighting accidental complexity: boilerplate, ceremony, incidental constraints. Those should be optimized away.\n\nBut removing accidental complexity doesn’t touch the essential kind. If the system must satisfy 200 business rules across 15 edge cases and 6 jurisdictions, you still have to specify them, verify them, and live with the interactions. No syntax trick erases that.\n\nStrip away the accidental complexity and the boundaries between coding, low-code, no-code, and vibe coding collapse. They’re all the same activity at different abstraction levels: conveying required behavior to an execution engine. Different skins, same job.\n\nAnd for what it’s worth: anyone who can fully express the requirements and a sound solution is, as far as I’m concerned, a software engineer, whether they do it in C++ or plain English.\n\nTL;DR: The bottleneck is semantic load, not keystrokes. Brooks called it “essential complexity.” Information theory calls it irreducible content. Everything else is tooling noise.",

Surprisingly, we find that when developers use AI tools, **they take 19% longer than without—AI makes them slower.** We view this result as a snapshot of early-2025 AI capabilities in one relevant setting; as these systems continue to rapidly evolve, we plan on continuing to use this methodology to help estimate AI acceleration from AI R&amp;D automation \\[1\\].\n\n\n\n&gt;Core Result\n\n&gt;When developers are allowed to use AI tools, they take 19% longer to complete issues—a significant slowdown that goes against developer beliefs and expert forecasts. This gap between perception and reality is striking: **developers expected AI to speed them up by 24%, and even after experiencing the slowdown, they still believed AI had sped them up by 20%.**\n\nIn about 30 minutes the most upvoted comment about this will probably be \"of course, AI suck bad, LLMs are dumb dumb\" but as someone very bullish on LLMs, I think it raises some interesting considerations. The study implies that improved LLM capabilities will make up the gap, but I don't think an LLM that performs better on raw benchmarks fixes the inherent inefficiencies of writing and rewriting prompts, managing context, reviewing code that you didn't write, creating rules, etc.\n\nImagine if you had to spend half a day writing a config file before your linter worked properly. Sounds absurd, yet that's the standard workflow for using LLMs. Feels like no one has figured out how to best use them for creating software, because I don't think the answer is mass code generation.",

      "text": "I’m an RN on a med/surg floor. Our normal ratio is 1:5, sometimes 1:6 on a bad day — but honestly our unit has always been pretty stable and fairly staffed.\n\nThen admin decided to “fix the nursing shortage” by hiring large numbers of brand-new LPN grads for almost half of the RN wage. The new model is:\n\t•\tLPNs get 6 patients each\n\t•\tOne RN “supervises” two LPNs\n\t•\tSo the RN is now responsible for 12 patients + 2 brand new nurses every shift\n\nMeanwhile… our unit was already fully staffed with RNs.\n\nBecause they suddenly don’t “need” us, they started putting RNs on standby for $3/hr. If we don’t get called in, they automatically pull from our PTO to pay out the shift. And when we do get called in, we’re floated to any unit that is short.\n\nToday FOUR RNs were put on standby. During huddle someone asked, “Is there a plan to fix this?” Management said:\n\n“We’re doing LPN blitz hiring for all the units that are short staffed.”\n\nAnother nurse asked:\n\n“So we’re going to be put on standby until enough RNs quit?”\n\nManager:\n\n“…Yes.”\n\nI wish I was joking.\n\nThey’re planning to roll this model out to progressive care next year.\n\n\n\nWhere the hell am I supposed to find a job if this takes off and other hospitals start adapting to this model? How am I going to get fair pay in a flooded market? I put myself in over $30K of debt to get my BSN., thinking I would always have job security. \n\nBeing responsible for 12 patients and two new grads is unsafe. They will not sit down and talk to us about the degree of legal responsibility we’re facing if an LPN screws up under our supervision. One nurse was told by management to get insurance. \n\nI can’t sleep.  Please tell me if this is happening where you are working, or if you’ve seen this plan fall apart, because I’m about to lose my mind. \n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nMy hospital is replacing RN staffing with large numbers of brand-new LPNs. Each RN now “supervises” two LPNs and is effectively responsible for 12 patients every shift. RNs are getting put on standby for $3/hr and losing hours while management openly admits they’re hiring LPNs until enough RNs quit. They won’t address the legal liability we face supervising these LPNs, and the model is expanding to progressive care. I’m scared for my license, my job security, and the future of the RN role. Has anyone seen this elsewhere or watched this model fail?\n\nEDIT:\nWow! This post got as much attention as I hoped it would — thank you to everyone who’s been commenting and sharing your experiences.\n\nA few people mentioned something I hadn’t even considered: that The Joint Commission is rolling out new staffing ratio expectations next year.\n\nIf that’s true, then what my hospital is doing starts to make a terrifying kind of sense:\nInstead of fixing RN staffing, they’re building a model where LPNs carry most of the patient load, and the RN is just there to supervise and absorb the liability.\n\nOn paper, hospitals can say:\n“Look, we have the correct number of licensed personnel for the ratios,”\neven if the actual care burden and the legal risk fall entirely on the RN.\n\nIt would explain the huge push to hire a ton of LPNs\n\nIf this is the direction hospitals are going to meet compliance benchmarks, then everyone in the profession should be alarmed, because this model threatens:\n- patient safety\n- RN job security\n- appropriate delegation\n- licensure protection\n\nThis whole situation just reinforces something a lot of nurses have been saying for years: we don’t actually have a “nursing shortage” — we have a shortage of nurses willing to work under unsafe conditions for inadequate pay. Hospitals are absolutely manufacturing the shortage. \n\nWhen hospitals can hire LPNs for half the cost of RNs and then put RNs on standby, float them, or push them out entirely, it becomes really clear the shortage isn’t about a lack of licensed nurses — it’s about a lack of acceptable working conditions that keep those nurses practicing at the bedside.",

      "title": "My first real emergency today… engine failure after takeoff in a twin",
      "text": "Well… after years of working as an instructor and a pilot and never having any incidents or scares, I finally had my first real emergency today.\n\nI was flying with a friend in a Beechcraft Travel Air. Helping them get comfortable in the plane. We prepared to takeoff after flying for a little while and after having done a few landings and taxi backs. We had briefed prior that if any emergency were to rise, I would take control as I had more experience in the aircraft. We started our roll down the runway, rotated and began to climb out. At about 300 to 400 feet off the runway, the left engine started to lose power before eventually shutting off. My friend instantly announced “your controls” to which I replied “my controls” as I took control of the aircraft. What happened next I can only describe as instincts kicking in. Identify. Verify. Feather. Within an instant, I knew the left engine was the one that failed. I quickly verified, feathered it and secured the engine. Thankfully, I had been teaching her the importance of airspeed in a twin engine and we were well above Vmca. I immediately pitched for blue line and began a slow climb of 100 to 200 ft/min. It was an untowered airport so I made radio calls that we had an engine failure and were returning back for the airport. In the back of my head, all I could hear was the voice of my chief pilot at my 135 job who had done a bunch of my training in the Baron: “Take your time. Fly the plane.” We were at blue line and climbing about 700-800 feet above the field. There’s no reason to panic. No towers nearby and no obstacles to hit. I took my time, making right turns into the good engine and set myself up to turn back and land on the opposite runway we took off from. Winds were calm. No issue there. I slowly made the large turn back, waited until we were closer to the runway before dropping gear and we thankfully landing back on the opposite runway with no issue. The airport managers came zooming out to make sure we were ok.\n\nMoral of this incident that I hope every pilot will take away from this:\n\nWe fall to the highest level of our training.\n\nNever stop training and beating those emergency procedures into your head. I had thankfully just finished my 135 training at my full time job in the Baron not even a month before, so single engine procedures were still fresh in my mind. You never know when this will happen to you, keep those emergency procedures fresh. It will save your life one day.\n\nFly safe my fellow aviators.",

      "text": "Governor Ron DeSantis continues to highlight Florida’s increasing education budget, yet much of that money never makes it into teachers’ paychecks. Instead, it’s funneled toward raising starting salaries while veteran educators—the foundation of the system—are left with stagnant wages. The referendum funding that’s supposed to help is nothing more than a public opinion gamble, leaving teachers’ financial security in the hands of voters rather than treating education as the essential service it is. No teacher should have to rely on the hope that their community values education enough to ensure they get paid fairly. Every child deserves access to a quality education, and that starts with retaining experienced, well-compensated teachers—not leaving them to wonder if their next raise will be on the ballot.\n\nThis is bigger than just a budget—it’s an entire generation at stake. The decisions being made today will shape Florida’s future workforce, economy, and society for decades. The state proudly claims to be ranked #1 in education, but step into any high school English classroom and the reality tells a different story. Basic literacy issues persist, with students struggling to sound out simple words. A decade ago, education outcomes were stronger. Now, national data confirms a steady decline in literacy, comprehension, and critical thinking.\n\nTeachers are walking away because the job is unsustainable. Workloads have tripled, classrooms are overcrowded, and yet the pay sits at $48,000 with an unreliable bonus system tied to a referendum. Why would anyone take on a high-stress, high-responsibility job for that salary when they can find better pay with less stress elsewhere? At this rate, Florida isn’t just facing a teacher shortage—it’s heading toward an educational collapse, where students are left behind because leadership values talking points over real investment in schools.\n\nThis isn’t about politics; it’s about common sense. Even those who support DeSantis should recognize that if Florida doesn’t address this now, the long-term consequences will be devastating. A population that lacks basic comprehension, a workforce that can’t meet future demands, and an economy weakened by a lack of skilled labor. Teachers are professionals who shape the next generation, and they deserve compensation that reflects their worth. If Florida continues to neglect this, the cost won’t just be failing schools—it will be a failing society.",

      "text": "In the last seven months, the Medical Council of Canada has seen a 750% increase in the number of Americans creating accounts on its site to initiate the licensure process, NPR reported May 29.\n\nThe number of American physicians seeking to move to Canada to practice has ebbed and flowed for decades, usually in reaction to political and economic fluctuations, but it has never been this high, experts told NPR.\n\nHere are five things to know:\n\n1. The first step in becoming licensed in Canada is to create an account on physiciansapply.ca. In the past seven months, 615 physicians have created accounts, compared to 71 applicants during the same time last year. In recent years, Canadian provinces have relaxed some licensing regulations and expedited licensing for U.S.-trained physicians.\n\n2. Both medical licensing organizations and companies that recruit physicians into Canada reported many physicians citing the Trump administration as their primary reason for moving.\n\n3. The Trump administration declined to comment on the trend when asked by NPR, but did ask if the news outlet knew the number of physicians and their citizenship status. The news outlet did not provide or have this information.\n\n4. Some recruiting companies reported a 65% increase in the number of American physicians looking for Canadian jobs between January and April. The College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario said it received license applications from about 260 U.S.-trained physicians — and registered 116 of them — in the first quarter of 2025. British Columbia, another province, said it licensed 28 U.S.-trained physicians in the fiscal year that ended in February — triple the total of the prior year.\n\n5. Rural communities in Canada launched an advertising campaign after President Trump’s election to recruit American physicians. The campaign focuses on physicians in Florida and North and South Dakota. Its key selling point: “zero political interference in physician patient relationship.”\n\nhttps://www.beckershospitalreview.com/quality/hospital-physician-relationships/us-physicians-seeking-canadian-licensure-up-750-in-7-months-5-notes",

      "text": "Every SWE says: \"Standups aren't status reports, they're for unblocking\". And that's true in theory, that's the textbook. The whole idea in agile is a quick daily sync where people share progress, surface blockers, and get help before issues snowball. It's supposed to be lightweight, team-driven, and focused on collaboration rather than accountability to a manager.\n\n\nBut in the 9 companies I've worked at, standups have always been status reports. Every single one of them. People go around the room listing what they did yesterday and what they'll do today, often phrased more to sound productive than to actually solve problems. Managers (and people who don't contribute to the standup) are always present. Rarely does anyone bring up a blocker, and when they do, it usually gets handled later in chat or a side conversation. The ritual ends up feeling more about reporting up than working together.\n\n\nSo I wonder: has anyone here actually experienced a standup that truly functioned the way agile describes it? Should we redefine the meaning of \"daily standup\" to adequately portray what happens in practice?",

      "text": "I’m a surgical subspecialty resident. I’ve spent more nights than I can count where I silently (or not so silently) judged my colleagues in the ER. Rolling my eyes at consults that felt lazy. Laughing along with other specialists about how emerge is just glorified triage. How they call for the stupidest shit. How they punt. How they don’t think.\n\nBut I had a moment tonight that I feel embarrassed even admitting.\n\nI realized I’m the fool.\n\nI’ve spent years getting irritated at what I thought was incompetence, when really I’ve just been blind to how structurally opposed our incentives are. I want them to do more; assess thoroughly, initiate treatment, tidy up the mess so my clinic stays clean. So I don’t get woken up at 3am when I have to work regardless the next day. \n\nBut they’re under relentless pressure to move people. The hospital isn’t judged on the quality of the primary assessment. It’s judged on time to bed, time to disposition, minutes to triage. They’re trying to stay afloat in a system that punishes them for doing too much and rewards them for offloading.\n\nAnd here I am, acting like their priorities should match mine. Like they’re just bad at their jobs, instead of crushed under an entirely different set of expectations.\n\nIt hit me that if emerge did everything the way I wanted, they’d clog up worse than ever. There aren’t enough staff. There isn’t enough space. Every minute they spend thinking deeply about a case is a minute someone else waits in a hallway. So of course they defer. Of course they cut corners. It’s not laziness. It’s survival.\n\nThe real problem, again, like always, isn’t each other. It’s the system. It’s the horrific, machine we’re all trapped inside, where throughput wins over thought, and deferral is built into the architecture. And the worst part is, we all know it. But we still act like it’s each other’s fault.\n\nBut it’s not just a nameless machine. It has a face. It’s the administrators shoveling quality metrics down our throats, who haven’t spent a single minute talking to a real patient in their entire miserable lives. Who make rules about our work without understanding its substance. Who treat “efficiency” like it’s the same thing as care.\n\nI don’t know what to do with this realization yet. But I know it’s changed how I see things. I know I’m not going to laugh so easily next time.\n\nEdit: yes I was an asshole. Probably still am. Will try to be less of one.",

      "text": "I came to the US from my home country in the EU for residency after finishing intern year back home about ten years ago. I was excited to be where real innovative medicine was practiced and doctors were well-paid, and didn't have strong feelings one way or the other about private insurance (back home it is socialized healthcare). Over the past few years as an attending though I have been increasingly haunted by the feeling that I am profiting from blood money, even though I deliberately chose to work at a state hospital that provides care to uninsured patients we are still billing and bankrupting them. I scaled up my free clinic hours, my husband and I donate to M4A advocacy groups, I am not sure what more I can do. I tried waiving my copay for patients in my clinic who indicated it was a barrier. But, my chairman somehow found out about this and was LIVID, he just came in and shouted at me \"do you have any idea how much trouble this could get the whole department in\" and \"how could you possibly think this was an OK thing to do?\" I just broke down crying because, who is it hurting? It only comes out of my compensation, and made me feel like I was making a system that feels like a sea of sh!t just a tiny bit more human.  \n\nSomething else I have noticed is that Americans are sooooo sick. I did med school and internship in one of Europe's top teaching hospitals which handles the most medically and socially complex patients. The sickest patient I ever saw would be just a regular patient in America. You get young patients presenting with diseases in advanced stages that basically only exist in textbooks in my country, for example kids in their 20s with no kidneys anymore because of being unable to treat T1DM.\n\nAm I the only one to feel this way? I have been really contemplating moving back. Attendings make just above $100k, which is considered a very good salary in my country, I am just worried about whether my husband could take that adjustment psychologically as he is procedural and currently makes a lot more--he is American and when I have talked to him about it, his solutions basically amount to vote for Bernie Sanders. \n\n",

      "title": "Mother \"Doesn't Recall\" the 2 Decades her Son was in Prison",
      "text": "Since everyone seemed to enjoy my last post about the awesome response (basically a smoking gun) I got from my subpoena to Disney, I thought I'd share my all-time favorite paralegal story.\n\nThe circumstances were tragic: a homeless man, mid-40's, was hit by our Insured and killed. Insured swore up and down he jumped in front of her car at the last minute and, honestly, I believe her. However, she had been convicted in the past for perjury (it was bad, made the news and everything), so we did NOT want to put her on the stand at trial. Clearly, no jury would believe her. \n\nDecedent's mother filed a lawsuit on behalf of herself and her granddaughter. The adjuster did a claims search and a basic background search and even used the in-house investigator to do a cursory search, but didn't find anything, so it looked like this was going to be a pretty bad case - a wrongful death suit where the driver had a high limit policy plus an umbrella policy.  I'm fortunate enough that my firm will NOT take cases where we feel it would be unethical to pursue - like if the Insured had been drinking, we'd tell the adjuster to either pay out or find another law firm. But the adjuster came to us and said something about this case \"just seemed fishy\" so he wanted to proceed with litigation, at least through discovery. Investigate? Sure, my favorite! \n\nFirst weird thing was the fact that the Deceased's mother (Plaintiff) filed this suit on behalf of herself and her granddaughter - but the mother of the daughter wasn't involved and wouldn't give permission for us to depose her minor daughter (a preteen, so not that young). But the Complaint alleged as damage the loss of a father figure, role model, and filial support - were we just supposed to accept that without evidence? But we just figured that's a problem for another day. So just a little weird, not a red flag or anything. \n\nSecond part that was also a little weird (though less so) was how I couldn't seem to find any criminal records for the Decedent. Not to be judgmental or anything, but he was homeless for over 2.5 years and it just seemed odd that he was capable of working and earning a living so he could afford a home but just ...didn't?  And I really believed he jumped in front of the car, so I thought he might've been high on drugs. I send FOIA to the Sheriff's Dept for that county as well as the surrounding ones, and I got back nearly 500 pages - but it was mostly incidental things relating to homeless camps, asking him about other crimes that happened in the camps, a few trespasses issued, and offering him rehab - and no arrests. So, seemed a bit odd but more like \"it is what it is\" sort of thing. \n\nThen we get back Plaintiff's answers to interrogatories - we ask the standard model questions, so of course one of them asked if the Decedent had ever been convicted of a crime. Her exact response: \"Not that I recall.\" Verified and under oath. \n\nI don't know why, but that phrasing seemed fishy to me. As was the fact that she \"couldn't recall\" his exact address prior to him moving down to this state nearly 3 years ago. Attorney said she'd ask about it at Plaintiff's depo the following week, but it just irked me, ya know? Why phrase it that way? Why not say just 'yes, he was arrested,' or 'no, he wasn't'? \n\nSo I started investigating - I call it \"going down a rabbit hole,\" where I suddenly look at the clock, realize I spent the last few hours or half a day on following less than a lead, when I should've been dealing with the million responses and filings and other stuff I have to do. So I wasn't expecting to find much, and the only \"leads\" I had was the death certificate listing his father being back up north, as well as listing the city where he was born. State and county courts don't bring up a single case, and I wasted more time trying the surrounding states and counties with no success, and that's normally when I would've given up. But for kicks, I started googling the Deceased's name, including variations, with those locations and up come a few articles from 1998-ish (one was literally AOL News, these were very archived) about a guy with a similar name (think \"Jon\" instead of \"Jonathan\" or \"Will\" instead of \"William\") *robbing a bank and leading the police on a high-speed chase*. \n\nThere's no way that's the same guy, right? I mean, the adjuster would've found this - right? RIGHT?!\n\nSo now I know to look at federal cases! I hop on PACER, find the right district, type in his last name, first initial, and DOB, and WOWZA! \n\nTurns out, he was convicted of armed robbery in 2000-ish, sentenced to 20 years, paroled after serving 12, at which point he kidnapped a minor, brought her over state lines, made terroristic threats, and committed assault and battery. Because it involved state lines, it was again federal and they ultimately didn't even pursue most of these new, additional charges in exchange for him having to serve the remaining years on his 20 year original sentence - no parole, no early release. So when he got out, he had no probation and that's when he decided to leave the state and move to our state. (Also based on this timeline, his daughter was clearly conceived during that crime spree - so I'm not sure, but can guess why his daughter's mother didn't want to be involved in the lawsuit. Probably also the reason they didn't pursue the new charges, to avoid her testifying as a victim - but again, I'm just speculating.) \n\nI immediately sent an FOIA request to the prison he served at and while I couldn't get most of what I wanted without a subpoena, I did get the correspondence log, showing who he got letters and packages from.  Guess who wrote her son *EVERY SINGLE WEEK* for those 20 years (minus the brief time he was out and on a crime spree)? \n\nThe depo, according to my attorney, started off with her asking the Plaintiff multiple times if she was sure her son had never been arrested. \"I don't recall.\" She confirmed that a mother would remember that sort of thing though, right? Like if she were to write someone, especially a son, in prison, she'd remember writing the letter, addressing an envelope, stamping it, and putting it in the mail to go to a state or federal prison, right? \"I guess.\" What if there were multiple letters? That would be more memorable, right? \"I guess so, but I don't recall doing that.\" \n\nAt which point, my attorney apparently pulled up on screen the correspondence log and - while scrolling through page after page after page - said something along the lines of, \"You don't remember writing your son every single week, plus each holiday, every year FOR TWENTY YEARS?! That's about 55 times a year, or approximately 1,100 times. You don't remember sending 1,100 cards and letters to your own son, addressed to a federal prison? And remember, you ARE under oath.\" \n\nHer attorney immediately called for a break, so there was no response to that question. When the depo resumed, he objected to the correspondence log being introduced as evidence. Attorney continued, saying a judge would rule on it later, and went thru it, wanting to know why there were no letters or correspondence from his daughter? After threatening to get phone records and visitation logs, Plaintiff admitted granddaughter never once saw or communicated with her dad while he was locked up. \"So after, when he moved to an entirely new state, how often did she see him?\" Well, apparently they called and FaceTimed - but she couldn't provide when, how frequently, or any proof he ever paid a cent of child support or other contribution to the child. After stating we'd subpoena phone records, Plaintiff admitted she never saw them talk on the phone or saw them FaceTime, nor is she sure her son had an iPhone, but \"she's sure\" they had \"some sort of relationship.\" Attorney asked for evidence and I was literally drafting a new Request for Production as this was going on, requesting a lot of the above, that was filed immediately after the deposition. (Edit to add: Plaintiff moved to our state in the early 90's, and of course media coverage from then isn't archived as well as it is today, so in the 5 days from when we discovered his criminal history and when her depo was held, we couldn't prove she was in court at the sentencing or trial or anything. I'm sure we could see if she spoke at sentencing, but that turned out to be unnecessary). \n\nCase was settled the next day - for one tenth of the main policy limits, the majority to be held in a trust for the granddaughter (that was our condition and apparently this got some push back from Plaintiff, but her own attorney seemed like he wasn't going to put up his client anymore). Adjuster was thrilled but also impressed that our office found this information that neither he nor their background investigator did. Kept asking, \"how did you know to dig in that small county in a state 1,000 miles away?\" Well, I didn't. It was literally just the way she answered that single interrogatory, \"Not that I recall,\" that was the only thing that seemed odd. In conjunction with all the other things, yeah, it makes sense in hindsight - why he didn't have a LOCAL criminal record, why we couldn't depose the daughter or daughter's mother, even why he was homeless (since it's hard for felons to be employed), but those things individually weren't suspicious. \n\nI just can't believe a mother wouldn't \"recall\" if her only child was ever arrested. \n\nI still go down rabbits holes, but they've never been as successful as this one. Lemme know if you want more stories like these, it's cases like this one that make me love my job! ",

      "title": "U.S.-Trained Doctors, Suddenly Unallowed to Work",
      "text": "Many of you have heard the phrase “travel ban” and assumed it only affects people trying to enter the United States. Since 2017, that was largely true. You would occasionally see stories about residents unable to start training because a visa was delayed or a ban blocked entry. But earlier this month, under the current administration, the scope shifted. What is happening now is different, and unprecedented in how far it reaches.\n\nThis has expanded beyond the border and is now impacting legal immigrant physicians already living and working inside the U.S. These are not new arrivals. These are physicians who have been here for 7 to 15 years, trained in the U.S., and built their lives here, not because of anything in their individual history, but solely because of their country of birth. For many international graduates, the path from intern year to a green card takes close to a decade, often longer with fellowship.\n\nMany of these doctors completed U.S. residency and fellowship, served in underserved communities under waiver obligations, and worked through COVID in ICUs, nights, weekends, and holidays. They followed the legal pathways: waivers, approved employment-based green card petitions, including cases deemed in the national interest, and routine work authorization renewals while their green card cases remain pending.\n\nNow those pathways are being placed on indefinite hold.\n\nGreen card processing, visa renewals, and work permits, the basic administrative steps required to keep showing up to work, are being placed on indefinite hold with no clear timeline and no meaningful guidance. People who have lived here for a decade are being pushed into quiet, indefinite limbo.\n\nThis is not theoretical. I personally know multiple physicians affected.\n\nI know nine colleagues, including a cardiologist, a critical care physician, and a plastic surgeon, who are months away from losing their ability to work solely because their pending green card work permits are not being adjudicated or renewed. They also cannot travel because re-entry is effectively impossible under current entry restrictions. I know an internist at a major institution who has already been forced off work for three months, despite multiple prior work permits and doing everything by the book. I know a friend recruited to become the first pediatric subspecialist in an underserved rural area whose contract negotiations stalled, not due to need or qualifications, but because the hospital cannot take the risk of hiring someone whose authorization could be arbitrarily frozen.\n\nThe human side is hard to describe unless you have lived it.\n\nOur profession demands certainty and accountability. We cannot practice medicine with “maybe.” Patients do not get to pause heart failure, STEMI, septic shock, or an airway emergency until bureaucracy feels ready. Our duties demand that we be present, calm, precise, and deeply empathetic. Many of us perform life-saving procedures and make high-stakes decisions that require focus and emotional stability.\n\nAnd yet we are being asked to do all of that while our own lives are held in suspense.\n\nImagine walking into the ICU to treat someone else’s crisis while not knowing whether you will be allowed to keep working next month. Imagine trying to reassure families and plan discharges while you cannot plan your own children’s schooling, your mortgage, your lease, or even whether you will still have an income. Imagine being placed in limbo indefinitely, not because of anything you did, but because of where you were born.\n\nIt is not just stressful. It is degrading. It feels like being denied basic dignity.\n\nI am not posting this for pity. I am posting because this is a patient-care and workforce issue, and it is happening quietly. Its been only 2 weeks since the expansion to include legal immigrant inside the US. Hospitals will feel this. Patients will feel this. Underserved areas will feel it first.\n\nIf you can help, please do.\n\nIf you have connections to medical societies, hospital leadership, government affairs offices, journalists, advocacy groups, or lawmakers, raise this issue. Ask them to look into the impact of this broad freeze on legal immigrant physicians already practicing in the U.S. Push for transparency, timelines, and a process that does not destroy careers and patient access by default.\n\nWe understand the need for security vetting and sensible reform. But blanket sweeps without precision create predictable collateral damage. Many of the physicians I know with approved green card petitions and waiting final step are not even asking for the green card to be issued immediately. They are simply asking for the ability to keep working through a stable, lawful immigration pathway. Placing work permits on hold and pushing long-term physicians, their families, and their patients into indefinite limbo should not be an acceptable outcome, especially when training each physician in the U.S. costs taxpayers roughly $750,000 to $2 million.\n\nEven sharing this helps. This is already happening, its been two weeks and it will get worse unless people speak up and advocate.",

I’ve worked at companies of various sizes — from seed-stage startups to pre-IPO unicorns to some of the largest tech companies.\n\n**A few caveats**\n\n* Anything I share reflects my personal experience and may carry some bias.\n* My experience is based in the US, particularly in Silicon Valley.\n* I have some people management experience but have mostly worked as an IC\n* Data science is a broad term.

It states that planned immigration raids and anti-immigrant violence threaten the solidarity necessary for the strength and survival of the labor movement and the working class as a whole.\n\nThe resolution asserts that neither government institutions nor big-business political parties can be relied upon to defend immigrant workers from bigoted attacks. Instead, it reaffirms the role of unions as self-defense organizations for the working class, capable of organizing meaningful, independent action in defense of vulnerable members of the workforce.\n\nIn passing the resolution, IBEW Local 11 commits to exploring the best ways to mobilize its membership to protect immigrant communities under threat, whether from federal enforcement actions or racist violence, and calls on the broader labor movement to join in this critical effort.\n\n\"Solidarity means standing up, speaking out, and taking action,\" said a representative of Local 11 following the vote. \"We are proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with immigrant workers and make it clear: we will not be divided.\"\n\nThis resolution marks a significant step toward building a labor movement that is inclusive, militant, and ready to confront the injustices facing working people across all borders and backgrounds.\n\n*IBEW Local 11 represents thousands of electrical workers across Los Angeles County and is committed to the principles of solidarity, dignity, and justice for all members of the working class.*",

Our repo is so small and not at all needed for AI. We have used a fuzzy search that has worked for the past three years. Additionally, I have already built out dashboards that retrieve all the information executives have asked for via API (who's viewing pages, what are they searching, etc.)\n\nI showed the c-suite executives our current dashboards in Tableau, and how the actual search works. I also explained what RAG is, and how AI/LLMs work at a high level. I explained to them that AI is a fantastic tool, but I'm not sure if we should be spending 100k a year on it. They also asked if I have built any predictive models. I don't think they quite understood what that was as well, because we don't have the amount of data or need to predict anything.\n\nNeedless to say, they decided it was best not to move forward \"for now\". I am shocked, but also not, that executives want to change the structure of how my team and end-users digest information just because they heard \"AI is awesome!\" They had zero idea how anything works in our shop.\n\nOh yeah, our company has already laid of 250 people this year due to \"financial turbulence\", and now they're wanting to spend 100k on this?!\n\nIt just goes to show you how deep the AI train runs.

Then they list with someone else. It happens every time. You’ll beg for referrals, knock doors, cold call, and still hear “no” more than “yes.”\n\nYou’re not selling houses. You’re running a one-man business. You’re your own marketer, social media manager, admin, therapist, and punching bag. If you don’t have money to outsource, guess what, you’re doing all of it yourself.\n\nAnd here’s what no one tells you: marketing costs destroy you. You’ll drop thousands on photos, staging, ads, open houses, and signs before you see a single dollar back. People love to flex their listings online, but half of them are broke behind the scenes.\n\nYou finally close a deal? Cool. Now wait a month or more to get paid. That one commission check has to last because you might not sell again for a while.\n\nForget weekends. Forget sleep. Buyers and sellers hit you up whenever they feel like it. You ignore them once and they’ll move to the next agent instantly.\n\nYou’ll get ghosted by clients you’ve worked with for months. Deals will fall apart at the last second. People will waste your time nonstop. You’ll be stressed 24/7 pretending you’ve got it together.\n\nThe industry’s flooded. Everyone’s a Realtor now. Most barely scrape by. The top 10% eat while the rest fight for crumbs.\n\nAnd with AI now writing listings, handling paperwork, and even doing virtual showings, if all you do is open doors and send comps, you’re done. Tech doesn’t sleep, and it doesn’t need a commission.\n\nIf you’re chasing fast money, don’t even bother. This business will eat you alive.\n\nBut if you can take rejection every day, spend money before making any, and still get up hungry to grind again tomorrow. maybe you’ll survive.\n\nFor everyone else, keep watching Selling Sunset. It’s cheaper.\n\n—A Realtor who’s seen too many people quit",

He was telling me that everyone in the healthcare industry is envious of doctors… physician assistants, CRNA, midwife’s, nurse practitioners, physical therapists! \n\nHe was saying someone can become a NP, or CRNA and they will NEVER be a doctor. \n\nWe ended up have a disagreement, in my opinion the only similarities between MD and the other healthcare professions are because they are in healthcare… scope of practice is totally different. \n\nHe said nursing is meant to be a bedside and people are becoming nurse practitioners to leave the bedside - which is wrong. I think it’s amazing when people advance their career. \n\n\nI can’t even tell my dad by career aspirations because he’ll just say I want to be a “doctor without doing the hard work”. He is so judgemental of every healthcare career other than medicine. \n\nHas anyone else experienced the same thing, and if so how did you overcome it? \n\nEdit: he is trying to convince me to be a doctor/go to medical school. I don’t have the determination to be a doctor, I value what they do but I couldn’t be part of their profession. I’m 20 (so I’m still quite young), at the moment I want to become a midwife. ",

Here is how I would break it down.\n\n1. **Understand the problem first (3 mins)** \\- restate it back, walk through examples, ask about constraints.\n2. **Don't code immediately (5 mins)** \\- discuss approaches starting with brute force, explain why it's bad, then work up to optimal solution. DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BRUTE FORCE SOLUTION. You don't have time for that.\n3. **Get buy-in (10 mins)** \\- make sure interviewer agrees with your approach before coding. I write pseudocode comments first as an outline, then flesh it out. A common failure pattern is coding something that the interviewer doesn't understand.\n4. **Wrap up (2 mins)** \\- explain time/space complexity, offer to write tests for edge cases, or move on to the next problem.\n\n**How I prepared:**\n\n* Use Blind 75. It has good coverage over all problems.\n* I DID NOT buy leetcode premium. If you study and understand the patterns, it doesn't matter what problem you get.\n\nI know the market is ass right now and the competition is rough, but stay disciplined and the hard work will pay off!

      "text": "Background: Current role is a TL (dev/manager hybrid at this place), my team has a large amount of domain ownership so we are constantly pinged for PR reviews.\n\nLately there has been a huge push for teams to adopt tools like Cursor, the problem is that while yes they can generate code, it is just lately rapidly becoming an endless stream of AI slop.\n\nIn the last few weeks:\n\n* Multiple 5k+ line PR's that should be sub 100 lines\n* PR's that have tons of changed files that in some vibe coding iteration were dropped or my new favourite thing endless redirection where multiple things don't actually do anything.\n* Very scary PR's where the AI did something extremely dangerous i am assuming to make tests work or something. For example one of the PR's actually did such a very subtle change where it aborted early in a middleware basically skipping most of AuthZ, then mocked out a good chunk of the AuthZ in tests which caused tests to pass. \n* AI hallucinating external services, then mocking out the hallucinated external services. Forcing me to go look up other repos/service maps and validate that yes this api endpoint actually exists. \n* AI's ignoring project architecture and structure, dumping files everywhere, or ignoring coding styles. \n\nThe problem is that these PR's are becoming exhausting as they keep touching on my teams domain, so we are required to review and approve them. Pretty much nobody wants to talk about this, nobody wants to discuss this fact. Today a junior came and dropped a 10k PR that is just all over the place, i just rejected it, pretty saying \"this issue does not need 10k LoC changed, and i am not going through this.\" \n\nHowever instead of well addressing the issues of lack of critical thinking or just copy and pasting a story in, instead i am getting push back for being too strict. My entire team has been complaining about this, on average my team of 6 is getting around 30 PR's a day from various teams now.\n\n*EDIT* To clarify a few things:\n\n* I have told them my issues in detail with other managers this specifically affects my team and a few others who are not discrete feature specific teams as our domain is much larger. Most don't care since it doesn't actually affect them and they specifically care about increasing their own velocity. Our bosses do not care and just want us to go faster.\n* We have several large monolith java applications, these code bases are not pretty but do have a decent test suite. Cursor specifically has huge issues with some of these project's structure where it will often just stuff into the first folder with a matching name it seems to find. \n* We do have code rules however they are nowhere near as well documented and enforced.",

The regulation will allow the education secretary to disqualify employers — not individuals — who engage in activities the department deems to have a \"substantial illegal purpose,\" such as assisting undocumented immigrants, providing gender transition care for minors or engaging in diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\n&gt; A group of 22 state attorneys general argues that the Education Department lacks the legal authority to carve out exceptions based on ideology, noting that the agency’s definition of illegality aligns with President Donald Trump’s policy objectives. In their lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, the group said the rule is \"arbitrary and capricious,\" as it grants the department unfettered power to target specific state policies or social programs.\n\n&gt; \"This administration has created a political loyalty test disguised as a regulation,\" said New York Attorney General Letitia James, who is leading the coalition of state AGs. \"It is unjust and unlawful to cut off loan forgiveness for hardworking Americans based on ideology.\"",

Kennedy, Jr., commit to preserving Americans’ access to vaccines and protecting the nation’s scientific and public health infrastructure. We, like so many others, hoped that the legions of career public health professionals who valued evidence and science would be able to educate the Secretary and his team, thus safeguarding our nation’s public health infrastructure and preserving public confidence in the work of these important institutions. Under the Secretary’s leadership, key public health protections have been weakened, and the immunization review process is devoid of experts and evidence.   \n\nThe Secretary’s consistent pattern of circumventing process and ignoring or downplaying scientific evidence is undermining the ability of any member of the Health and Human Services department to operate effectively. His own conflicts of interest and inability to see the conflicts of those in his inner circle further undermine his credibility and that of his entire department.  \n\nToday, we are in an environment where HHS and its leaders are fostering confusion, chaos and conspiracies. As a result, we are seeing an alarming decline in confidence among the American public.  According to the [Pew Trust](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2025/08/27/republicans-views-of-justice-department-fbi-rebound-as-democrats-views-shift-more-negative/?utm_source=Pew+Research+Center&amp;utm_campaign=e22c94cc3c-Weekly_8-30-25&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-e22c94cc3c-399891433%22%20%5Cl%20%22shifting-views-of-health-agencies), confidence in HHS is now below 50% - an astonishing 8-point drop in 8 months and a 20-point drop over the past decade.   \n\nThe pattern of behavior demonstrated by Secretary Kennedy and his recent testimony have led to declining confidence among the American people in HHS’s ability to provide clear, concise and evidence-based direction on important public health issues. **The American Academy of Family Physicians has no choice but to call for action.** Our call is not driven by politics or partisanship but rather by our deep commitment to the health and wellness of the patients we serve. **We urge the President to continue prioritizing the health and safety of the American people by re-evaluating Secretary Kennedy’s ability to serve in his current capacity.** Similarly, we call on Congress to strengthen its oversight and protect the health of the American people.   \n\nAmerica’s health depends on swift and decisive action.  \n\n[Family Physicians Call on President to Reconsider Secretary Kennedy’s Ability to Serve  | AAFP](https://www.aafp.org/news/media-center/statements/family-physicians-call-on-president-to-reconsider-secretary-kennedys-ability-to-serve.html) ",

A professional degree is a degree that:\n\n(i) Signifies both completion of the academic requirements for beginning practice in a given profession and a level of professional skill beyond that normally required for a bachelor's degree:\n\n(ii) Is generally at the doctoral level, and that requires at least six academic years of postsecondary education coursework for completion, including at least two years of post-baccalaureate level coursework:\n\n(iii) Generally requires professional licensure to begin practice; and\n\n(iv) Includes a four-digit program CIP code, as assigned by the institution or determined by the Secretary, in the same intermediate group as the fields listed in paragraph (2) (i) of this definition.\n\n2. A professional degree may be awarded in the following fields:\n\n(i) Pharmacy (Pharm.D.), Dentistry (D.D.S. or D.M.D.), Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M.), Chiropractic (D.C. or D.C.M.), Law (L.L.B. or J.D.), Medicine (M.D.), Optometry (O.D.), Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), Podiatry (D.P.M., D.P., or Pod.D.), Theology (M.Div., or M.H.L.), and Clinical Psychology (Psy.D.) \n\n(3) A professional student under this definition:\n\n(i) May not receive title IV aid as an undergraduate student for the same period of enrollment; and\n\n(ii) Must be enrolled in a program leading to a professional degree under paragraph (2) of this definition.”\n\nI have mixed feelings on this, because I have a great respect for each of these fields. I think each healthcare team member is vitally important (from the sanitation technician to the physician). My dad is a PT (DPT, OCS), and to think of him as not a professional, given his level of expertise, seems short-sighted. I also hate the idea of people not being able to afford to become a nurse, PA, PT, etc., because their loans are capped at a much lower tier, because they are not \"professional\" degrees. Overall, I am just not sure if this is a W or L.\n\nTL;DR Loans are going to be capped lower for non-\"professional\" degrees per a new definition created by the Dept of Ed; nursing, PT, PA, and others appear to not qualify as professional per new guidelines to be potentially implemented July 2026.",

      "text": "Context: I was just reading through [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1nsmx8g/missed_deadline_on_unfamiliar_tech_how_bad_is_this/) written by a redditor who's been working on a particular task at their job for over a month, a task which was \"supposed\" to take 1.5 weeks, and everyone in the top comment was dogpiling on her and downvoting her, saying she's broken her manager's trust, etc.\n\nFirst of all, Jesus you people, I thought this sub was supposed to be on the workers' side, or at least, helping to support one another. Secondly, I just left a job that had this exact kind of mentality and team dynamic and let me tell you, it is not fun, it is not sustainable, and I don't think I was any more productive at that job than I was at previous jobs where they gave me:\n\n* well-defined tasks,\n* ownership over the solution,\n* freedom to make my own technical decisions, and finally\n* the time and space to figure it out for myself, and to just \"let me know when it's finished\"\n\nTHAT'S trust. Not this bullshit about consistent delivery. Not every technical problem CAN HAVE \"consistent delivery\". Anyone who's working in this field knows that some problems involve bashing your head against the wall for 8 days until you suddenly have a eureka moment, and then the solution comes together in 40 minutes. That's life. And if you think that in this hypothetical situation, the employee \"wasn't adding value\" during those 8 days, then allow me to share with you the stonecutters credo:\n\n&gt;When nothing seems to help, I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not that blow that did it, but all that had gone before.\n\nAlso, for the record, fuck poker planning, and fuck the concept of \"supposed to take X long\". If you give me a task, I'll tell you how long I think it'll take ME to do it, and you bet your ass I'll complete it as fast as I possibly can, and if I'm stuck, I'll ask people for help. Oh, you say some other colleague can do it in half the time? Great, then give the task to him, and let's just keep adding onto all of the tribal knowledge that only lives in that guy's head, and keep jacking up the bus factor of our team. Oh, what's that, he's swamped and can't take on the extra work? Ok, so I guess you're stuck with me then; the guy whose skills you apparently deemed good enough during my 7 interview rounds for this job. I will do the best possible job I can for you, but I'm not that other guy. I am me, and I am always learning, always improving, and if you give me time &amp; space to develop a deep understanding of the codebase, our architecture, our team processes, etc., I'm positive that I will soon grow to a place where I can complete tasks like this in 1.5 weeks!\n\nShit will get done when it gets done, and it won't go any faster with a manger constantly harassing the employee about delays and \"consistent delivery\". In fact, it will probably just make things worse, because now instead of having a calm, clear mind devoted to solving the technical problem at hand, the employee is wasting precious cycles locked in fear-based thinking, increased cortisol levels, and reduced blood flow to the brain.",

      "text": "[https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grieving-husband-says-reckless-texas-abortion-law-led-to-pregnant-wifes-death/](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/grieving-husband-says-reckless-texas-abortion-law-led-to-pregnant-wifes-death/)\n\n\"I blame the doctors, I blame the hospital, and I blame the state of Texas,\" Ngumezi said.\n\n...\n\n\"I feel like the law is very reckless...very dangerous,\" Ngumezi said.\n\nPorsha Ngumezi wasn't given a D&amp;C, a surgical procedure that can be used when a miscarriage isn't complete and the patient is bleeding excessively — as Ngumezi was at the time. It's the same procedure used for many abortions, but doctors told CBS News their colleagues [hesitate to perform them](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doctors-say-texas-strict-abortion-laws-put-pregnant-women-and-physicians-at-risk-60-minutes-transcript/), fearing the state's criminal penalties.\n\nNgumezi believes that's what happened in his wife's situation. She eventually went into cardiac arrest and died.\n\n\"I just felt like the doctor turned his back on us. You know, 'I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to lose my license or get fined, so the best course is for me to protect myself,'\" Ngumezi said.\n\n...\n\nState Sen. Bryan Hughes, who authored the legislation banning most abortions in Texas, said, \"Most hospitals are getting this right, but some are not.\"\n\nIn response to doctors' concerns about the [ramifications](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/texas-abortion-law-impact-pregnant-women-60-minutes/), Hughes said, \"I hear that. And I can show you the definition of abortion in Texas and it says removal of a miscarriage is not an abortion.\"\n\nHughes said the legislature is working on clarifying the language, but the law has yet to be amended.\n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \n[https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban](https://www.propublica.org/article/porsha-ngumezi-miscarriage-death-texas-abortion-ban)\n\n...\n\nBut because D&amp;Cs are also used to end pregnancies, the procedure has become tangled up in state legislation that restricts abortions. In Texas, any doctor who violates the strict law risks up to 99 years in prison. Porsha’s is the fifth case ProPublica has reported in which women died after they did not receive a D&amp;C or its second-trimester equivalent, a dilation and evacuation; three of those deaths were in Texas.\n\n...\n\nTexas doctors told ProPublica the law has changed the way their colleagues see the procedure; some no longer consider it a first-line treatment, fearing legal repercussions or dissuaded by the extra legwork required to document the miscarriage and get hospital approval to carry out a D&amp;C. This has occurred, ProPublica found, even in cases like Porsha’s where there isn’t a fetal heartbeat or the circumstances should fall under an exception in the law. Some doctors are transferring those patients to other hospitals, which delays their care, or they’re defaulting to treatments that aren’t the medical standard.\n\n...\n\n“Stigma and fear are there for D&amp;Cs in a way that they are not for misoprostol,” said Dr. Alison Goulding, an OB-GYN in Houston. “Doctors assume that a D&amp;C is not standard in Texas anymore, even in cases where it should be recommended. People are afraid: They see D&amp;C as abortion and abortion as illegal.”\n\n...\n\nStill, the doctor didn’t mention a D&amp;C at this point, records show. Medical experts told ProPublica that this wait-and-see approach has become more common under abortion bans. Unless there is “overt information indicating that the patient is at significant risk,” hospital administrators have told physicians to simply monitor them, said Dr. Robert Carpenter, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist who works in several hospital systems in Houston. Methodist declined to share its miscarriage protocols with ProPublica or explain how it is guiding doctors under the abortion ban.\n\nAs Porsha waited for Hope, a radiologist completed an ultrasound and noted that she had “a pregnancy of unknown location.” The scan detected a “sac-like structure” but no fetus or cardiac activity. This report, combined with her symptoms, indicated she was miscarrying.\n\nBut the ultrasound record alone was less definitive from a legal perspective, several doctors explained to ProPublica. Since Porsha had not had a prenatal visit, there was no documentation to prove she was 11 weeks along. On paper, this “pregnancy of unknown location” diagnosis could also suggest that she was only a few weeks into a normally developing pregnancy, when cardiac activity wouldn’t be detected. Texas outlaws abortion from the moment of fertilization; a record showing there is no cardiac activity isn’t enough to give physicians cover to intervene, experts said.\n\nDr. Gabrielle Taper, who recently worked as an OB-GYN resident in Austin, said that she regularly witnessed delays after ultrasound reports like these. “If it’s a pregnancy of unknown location, if we do something to manage it, is that considered an abortion or not?” she said, adding that this was one of the key problems she encountered. After the abortion ban went into effect, she said, “there was much more hesitation about: When can we intervene, do we have enough evidence to say this is a miscarriage, how long are we going to wait, what will we use to feel definitive?”\n\n...\n\nPerforming a D&amp;C, though, attracts more attention from colleagues, creating a higher barrier in a state where abortion is illegal, explained Goulding, the OB-GYN in Houston. Staff are familiar with misoprostol because it’s used for labor, and it only requires a doctor and a nurse to administer it. To do a procedure, on the other hand, a doctor would need to find an operating room, an anesthesiologist and a nursing team. “You have to convince everyone that it is legal and won’t put them at risk,” said Goulding. “Many people may be afraid and misinformed and refuse to participate — even if it’s for a miscarriage.”\n\n...\n\nSince Porsha died, several families in Texas have spoken publicly about similar circumstances. This May, when Ryan Hamilton’s wife was bleeding while miscarrying at 13 weeks, the first doctor they saw at Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville noted no fetal cardiac activity and ordered misoprostol, according to medical records. When they returned because the bleeding got worse, an emergency doctor on call, Kyle Demler, said he couldn’t do anything considering “the current stance” in Texas, according to Hamilton, who recorded his recollection of the conversation shortly after speaking with Demler. (Neither Surepoint Emergency Center Stephenville nor Demler responded to several requests for comment.)\n\nThey drove an hour to another hospital asking for a D&amp;C to stop the bleeding, but there, too, the physician would only prescribe misoprostol, medical records indicate. Back home, Hamilton’s wife continued bleeding until he found her passed out on the bathroom floor. “You don’t think it can really happen like that,” said Hamilton. “It feels like you’re living in some sort of movie, it’s so unbelievable.”\n\nAcross Texas, physicians say they blame the law for interfering with medical care. After ProPublica reported last month on two women who died after delays in miscarriage care, 111 OB-GYNs sent a letter to Texas policymakers, saying that “the law does not allow Texas women to get the lifesaving care they need.”\n\nDr. Austin Dennard, an OB-GYN in Dallas, told ProPublica that if one person on a medical team doubts the doctor’s choice to proceed with a D&amp;C, the physician might back down. “You constantly feel like you have someone looking over your shoulder in a punitive, vigilante type of way.”\n\nThe criminal penalties are so chilling that even women with diagnoses included in the law’s exceptions are facing delays and denials. Last year, for example, legislators added an update to the ban for patients diagnosed with previable premature rupture of membranes, in which a patient’s water breaks before a fetus can survive. Doctors can still face prosecution for providing abortions in those cases, but they are offered the chance to justify themselves with what’s called an “affirmative defense,” not unlike a murder suspect arguing self defense. This modest change has not stopped some doctors from transferring those patients instead of treating them; Dr. Allison Gilbert, an OB-GYN in Dallas, said doctors send them to her from other hospitals. “They didn’t feel like other staff members would be comfortable proceeding with the abortion,” she said. “It’s frustrating that places still feel like they can’t act on some of these cases that are clearly emergencies.” Women denied treatment for ectopic pregnancies, another exception in the law, have filed federal complaints.\n\n...\n\nThis past May, Marlena Stell, a patient with symptoms nearly identical to Porsha’s, arrived at another hospital in the system, Houston Methodist The Woodlands. According to medical records, she, too, was 11 weeks along and bleeding heavily. An ultrasound confirmed there was no fetal heartbeat and indicated the miscarriage wasn’t complete. “I assumed they would do whatever to get the bleeding to stop,” Stell said.\n\nInstead, she bled for hours at the hospital. She wanted a D&amp;C to clear out the rest of the tissue, but the doctor gave her methergine, a medication that’s typically used after childbirth to stop bleeding but that isn’t standard care in the middle of a miscarriage, doctors told ProPublica. \"She had heavy bleeding, and she had an ultrasound that's consistent with retained products of conception.\" said Dr. Jodi Abbott, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Boston University School of Medicine, who reviewed the records. \"The standard of care would be a D&amp;C.\"\n\nStell says that instead, she was sent home and told to “let the miscarriage take its course.” She completed her miscarriage later that night, but doctors who reviewed her case, so similar to Porsha’s, said it showed how much of a gamble physicians take when they don’t follow the standard of care. “She got lucky — she could have died,” Abbott said. (Houston Methodist did not respond to a request for comment on Stell’s care.)\n\nIt hadn’t occurred to Hope that the laws governing abortion could have any effect on his wife’s miscarriage. Now it’s the only explanation that makes sense to him. “We all know pregnancies can come out beautifully or horribly,” Hope told ProPublica. “Instead of putting laws in place to make pregnancies safer, we created laws that put them back in danger.”\n\n\\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n[https://www.smfm.org/emtala#:\\~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Alliance,care%2C%20even%20in%20emergency%20situations](https://www.smfm.org/emtala#:~:text=In%20January%202025%2C%20the%20Alliance,care%2C%20even%20in%20emergency%20situations)\n\nSigned into law in 1986, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) requires hospitals that receive Medicare funds to treat and stabilize anyone who presents with an emergency medical condition, regardless of their ability to pay and regardless of the type of care required.  If the hospital is not equipped to provide treatment, it must arrange a transfer.  [EMTALA requires hospitals to offer abortion care](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-22-22-hospitals.pdf) if needed to stabilize a pregnant person in an emergent situation, and the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) offers several [resources](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)[ ](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act)for providers. \n\nSince the Dobbs decision, there has been litigation focused on whether EMTALA’s requirements to provide stabilizing care supersede state abortion bans.\n\n...\n\n*Texas*\n\n* In October 2024, the US Supreme Court denied the [Biden Administration's petition](https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/10/court-turns-down-bidens-bid-for-intervention-in-texas-emergency-abortion-dispute/#:~:text=By%20Amy%20Howe,threatens%20their%20lives%20or%20health) to hear the Texas case, thereby leaving the lower court’s ruling intact. \n\n* In August 2022, a federal judge agreed with the State of Texas and temporarily blocked the HHS EMTALA guidance. HHS appealed the ruling, and again, SMFM joined partner organizations in filing an [amicus brief ](https://assets.noviams.com/novi-file-uploads/smfm/Advocacy/Reproductive_Health/Becerra_Texas_Doc__38_Motion_and_Amicus_Brief-ed3c1dfb.pdf)detailing how Texas and the lower court misunderstood EMTALA and the realities of emergency medical care. \n\n* In July 2022, Texas filed a lawsuit against HHS asserting that the July 2022 [HHS EMTALA guidance](https://www.cms.gov/files/document/qso-22-22-hospitals.pdf) did not provide a basis for the federal government to compel clinicians to offer abortion care. In response, SMFM joined ACOG, ACEP, and the American Medical Association to file an [amicus brief](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.smfm.org/media/3629/Amicus_Brief_8.16_-_Texas_v._Becerra.pdf) explaining the importance of the federal law requiring clinicians to provide stabilizing medical care, including abortion care, to patients experiencing medical emergencies.  \n\n# Federal Agency Activities\n\n* The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) [continues to provide guidance](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/regulations-guidance/legislation/emergency-medical-treatment-labor-act) on EMTALA including a 2022 [letter from Secretary Becerra](https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/emergency-medical-care-letter-to-health-care-providers.pdf) reaffirming that EMTALA requires clinicians to offer necessary stabilizing care for patients suffering emergency medical conditions, including abortion care. Some portions of this guidance are now unenforceable in Texas and for members of certain anti-abortion organizations due to a court injunction.  \n\n\\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI hate how lawmakers and families are putting the blame on their physicians and hospitals when we have elected representatives who campaigned on and wrote an anti-abortion law with massive penalties for violation and unclear exemptions for emergency care. No wonder Ob/Gyns are fleeing the state, who wants to watch their patient hemorrhage to death while you wonder if you will be prosecuted with a risk of life imprisonment for providing life-saving treatment?",

I’m not a SDE but still grinded leetcode and got my certs in SAA and Cloud+. \n\nOn top of that I had to mass apply like a maniac since my freshman year as in 30 apps a week, to get a couple of internships to set the best outcome for me possible out of college. My GPA never went under a 3.8 and I made sure to TA and volunteer early on. \n\nLike the point is, it makes me sick people think they can skip all of this and get to that salary, it just sounds so entitled hearing “can I get into tech with just my A+, full remote, and pays at least 100k.” The amount of post I see per day asking this is just disgusting, yes it sounds like I’m gatekeeping from the field, but tbh I would not really have an issue with people who wanted to get into this field, did their research that market is rough, and have realistic expectations on what they need to get their first helpdesk job.\n\nWhy does everyone keep looking at the one guy who made six figures, no experience. It’s a one off situation, why does everyone keep people suddenly think they’re built different than others after seeing one YouTube video? \n\nAlso spoiler alert, majority of people in IT don’t make six figures, there’s a reason why six figures is the top 15% in the US. within that 15% there are doctors, lawyers, politicians, other engineers unrelated to tech. So how many tech people do you really think make six figures? Be real people, and if you’re in IT or getting into IT, you should have the logical comprehension to figuring that shit out. ",

My heart fucking *sank*, but I stayed calm and asked him if his hands were up. His answer was, and this is a direct and verbatim quote:\n\n\"Hemorrhoids.

      "text": "A number of years ago I worked as a pharmacist at the corner. I was a floater in a geographically large district, meaning I covered different stores across a huge region. One store was 100+ miles from home, in a rough area where staff had been robbed. Guess where my DM (via the market scheduler) kept scheduling me? Every. Single. Week.\n\nWhen I asked to rotate closer to home, he said I was the only one “experienced enough” for that location. Then I learned it is WAG's policy that floaters could claim mileage reimbursement for anything beyond 50 miles each way plus meals. That could have saved me a fortune.\n\nI filed the forms. He “lost” them. Every time. A coworker showed me how to fax them directly to Accounts Payable instead, right in the pharmacy, and suddenly my DM was blowing up my phone. He begged me to stop.\n\nThen came the bait: he’d “make me staff” at that store, no raise yet, but soon. And the reminder that staff positions aren’t eligible for mileage pay. I needed the stability, the job market for my area was garbage, so I agreed. A bizarre catch that should have been my first clue: I had to keep this \"promotion\" secret. Apparently I would be eventually replacing the current staff RPh at the store.\nSpoiler alert: That never happened.\n\nFast-forward two years. The store was so utterly toxic, I was burned out, and I asked to go back to floating. DM's response?\n\n&gt; “You are already in the role of market pharmacist- we just kept most of your shifts at a consistent store for you and the customer’s familiarity.”\n\n\nThat’s when everything clicked. He’d never actually promoted me, he just said he had, to stop me from filing reimbursements. And that single email confirming that I’ve “always been a floater” became my smoking gun.\n\nI found a new job (my dream career, outside retail) and handed in my notice. Then I went digging through two years of mileage records. Policy said nothing about time limits on reimbursements, so I spent my notice period faxing in every last one. Hundreds of shifts worth. I skipped meal receipts to keep it simple.\n\nA few weeks later, the checks started arriving. Tax-free. One after another.\n\nCue another panicked call from the DM, now with some loss-prevention manager on the line, claiming I was “never eligible.” They didn't even know how much these were going to total out to. I played coy, strung then along and calmly declined to discuss anything at length over the phone. Over the next few days over email, they got more aggressive, demanding renumeration and threatening legal action because as a staff pharmacist, I was ineligibleand I knew it. \n\nOnly then, calm as you like, did I send my coup de gras. I reminded them about that email, and that I had separately confirmed with HR that as a floater I was fully entitled to the reimbursements. Never heard another peep from any of them.\n\nFinal total: well over $21,000 in tax-free mileage reimbursement.\n\nDM and the store manager tried to play some wierd power game and save a few bucks by lying. Instead, I took every dime I was entitled to all at once, right at the end. Almost certainly screwed the store and District budget sheets for a stretch.\n\nMoral: know your company policies, get everything in writing, and never, EVER trust some middle management suit to not gaslight you out of what you’ve earned.\n\nTl;dr: DM lied to keep me driving 200 miles a day to a shitty store. I found out, and got a $21k goodbye present.",

GME has *completely gutted* every residency program's wellness and programmatic funds. These were the funds that covered things like lunches during didactics, wellness activities, and even our graduation celebrations. All gone. It seems like they just repackaged our old funds into this “new” educational stipend to make it look like they were giving us something extra. And to add insult to injury, they're claiming we’re not even eligible for the full $2k because we signed the contract mid-academic year.\n\nIt feels like this was their plan all along—throw us a bone, take everything else away, and punish us for standing up for ourselves. Wellness? Nah, apparently not something we deserve anymore.\n\nTo give you an idea of how desperate things are, someone even started a GoFundMe to help us cover what GME ripped away. I’m not linking it here (because rules), but just know: it’s bad.\n\nI’m so sick of the exploitation.

White doctors were much more likely to care for low or very low birth weight infants, leading to their higher overall mortality rates. When controlling for this variable the survival rates were not significantly different. \n\nNow there's this. A reporter filed a FOIA request for correspondence between authors and reviewers of the article and found that the study did see a survival benefit with racial concordance between physician and patient, however it was only with white infants and physicians. They removed lines in the paper stating that it does not fit the narrative that they sought to publish with the study. \n\n\nhttps://dailycaller.com/2025/03/31/exclusive-researchers-axed-data-point-undermining-narrative-that-white-doctors-are-biased-against-black-babies/\n\n\nPretty wild that they were so open about that in official correspondence.

I've seen them struggle to save and open files (they go to File--&gt;Save to save a file or to File---&gt; Open as if file explorer doesn't exist)\n\n2- They suck at technology. I've yet to see a boomer who's actually good using tech and isn't cancerous to work with\n\n3- They give stupid and outdated PEP talks that you're forced to listen to about life that are completely irrelevant in this day and age, and they believe all the bullshit they spew is fact and law which makes it even more unbearable.\n\n4- They don't want to pay employees. They think we still live in the 70s or 80s when everything was dirt cheap. Some of them barely understand inflation.\n\n5- They're super cringe to work with. Their humor is  awkward and old.\n\n6- The ones who are CPA's? I don't get it. The content and material has tripled since then so how do they still hold that title? They suck at accounting.\n\n7-Because they suck at technology, they suck at implementing processes and formulating solutions, so they throw it on the lower level employees and call it a day.\n\n8- They have bad temperament. A lot of the ones at the higher end of the chain are incredibly impatient and bad at understanding the reality of deadlines\n\nIf you disagree with any of this you're coping hard.",

You can attend a highly respected university, excel academically, gain admission to a PA program with a 3-4% acceptance rate, study 70 hours a week for two years, complete a fellowship—and still have less practice authority, fewer job opportunities, and lower pay than an NP who completed their entire education at Chamberlain or Walden.\n\nI also resent the focus on “clinical hours performed” as if that even begins to capture the difference. The acceptance rate alone creates a drastically different labor pool before the educational differences even begin. On top of that, PA programs provide a much more rigorous didactic education—even compared to NPs from Ivy League brick-and-mortar schools.\n\nMany of us chose this profession because we thought we would enjoy it, but the job market doesn’t reflect the value we bring. Instead, it rewards the opposite, which is incredibly disheartening. And nothing seems likely to change.\n\nSad state of affairs. Any thoughts from my fellow PAs?",

He got a job as a farm hand this summer, and his boss started teaching him MIG welding. Now he’s absolutely hooked. He comes home excited to talk about welds, penetration (I try not to giggle like a 12 year old), and how satisfying it is to see things he’s worked on hold together. His boss told him he’s doing really well “for a first timer” and suggested he get a small welder for home to keep practicing.\n\nNow here’s where I need help:  \n\\- What would you recommend for a beginner’s welder for at-home practice?  \n\\- He’s learning MIG on the farm—should we get him a MIG for home too, or would it make sense to start him on TIG to broaden his skills? How hard is it to transfer from MIG to TIG?  \n\\- Any other gear or tools we should grab to set up a safe space for him to practice? (welding helmet suggestions would be great!)  \n(Located in South-Western Ontario)\n\nI’m just so proud of him for discovering something he’s passionate about and taking the initiative to build real skills that could turn into a career after high school if he wants it. I know nothing about welding beyond what I’ve googled, so any advice from the people who actually do this would mean the world to me (and him).\n\nThanks in advance from a proud but clueless parent.",

I’m currently a radiologic technology student, and recently I volunteered to be a test patient during my internship—since I’ve never had an MRI myself, I thought it would be a cool learning experience.\n\nBut during the scan, something unexpected showed up in my brain.\n\nOur supervising doctors had varying interpretations at first, but after some review, they concluded that I have a quadrigeminal cistern lipoma—a very rare type of intracranial tumor. Apparently, it occurs in only about 1 in 100,000 people.\n\nTo say I was shocked is an understatement. I had no symptoms and didn’t even suspect anything unusual. I basically found out I have a brain tumor by accident...while helping out for practice.\n\nI’m still processing everything, and while it’s classified as a lipoma (benign fat tissue), it’s still sitting in a pretty delicate area near important brain structures. Some doctors say it doesn’t usually need treatment unless it causes problems, but I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on it moving forward.\n\nJust thought I’d share this wild twist in my journey as a radtech student.

      "text": "I (24M) have been doing IT for a chain of clinics for over a year with no issues—until today. I was on a call helping a doctor with some software. About 10 minutes in (only 4 of which I was actually on his laptop), he snapped and said, “I have shit to do and you’re just fucking around. Can you get someone who knows what the fuck they’re doing?”\n\nI had just uninstalled the app and was about to reinstall it. I told him, “You don’t have to talk to me like that,” and he kept cussing me out. My team lead overheard and took over the call. I was heated, so I stepped out and took a walk to calm down.\n\nLater, I told my manager I needed the rest of the day off, and he was understanding. He also said he heard the call, confirmed I did everything right, and that they’re reporting it to HR and the CEO. Still, I doubt anything will happen—he’s a doctor and brings in money.  \n\nNot looking for advice or anything just ranting maybe I am in the wrong but idk. My parents and manager says I shouldn’t let stuff like that get under my skin but I’m not used to be talking to like that especially when I’m helping someone. I need to get out of help desk. \n\nUpdate: I want to clear up a few things. I do not work for an MSP — I’m directly employed by the clinic. That means the doctor involved isn’t just some external client; he was my coworker.\n\nAlso, I did not take the entire day off. I only left one hour early.\n\nAfter speaking with management, I learned this isn’t the first time this doctor has acted this way. Management is fully on my side. They’ve already spoken with HR and the Chief Regional Officer (CRO) about the situation.\n\nThey made it clear this incident does not affect my standing with the company in any way. They told me they know my character and how I treat our users. They specifically mentioned I’m typically very calm and professional, and that it takes a lot to get a reaction out of me — so they understood that the doctor must have said something inappropriate.\n\nFor context, the first six minutes of the call were me trying to connect to his laptop using LogMeIn123, which anyone familiar with the tool knows is a standard part of our process.\n\nManagement also let me know the doctor has since apologized.",

      "text": "I haven't really seen an uptick in Buyers reaching out directly on my listings, but when I do most of them have simple questions and almost all \"Just want to see the house\" and expect me to show it on their timeframe. I obtain permission from all my sellers ahead of time, in writing, to qualify an unrepresented Buyer before the seller allows the showing, especially if it's owner occupied. A seller isn't going to just leave to allow someone \"just looking\" to go through their home. \n\nSo I get a call, guy wants to see my 650k listing. Gives me his name, offers proof of funds ahead of time. Great! We set up a time to view the property, it's vacant. A couple days later he calls me before the showing. \n\n\"Hey I'm interested in the home but I feel it's overpriced based on my research.\" I tell him OK, what research and data do you have access to? It's been on market less than a week with 4 showings. Of course a home is only worth what someone is willing to pay, so tell me, in your opinion what is the value? He replies with\" Probably around $550,000 based on my research. \"\n\nAt this point I realize it's not necessarily worth my effort to continue to further educate him. I politely tell him, that unfortunately his opinion is wrong, based on my decade of experience and with local comps we're actually priced 2.5% under those comps. That I'm anticipating an offer from one of the 4 showings and he hasn't even seen the property yet to determine condition or if he likes it. \n\nHe replies \"I've seen enough online, I'd like to offer $550,000 and ask for 9% in Closing costs, with 3% of that being the Realtor Commission back to me\". \n\nAt this point I have a decision, I can discontinue the call and call my seller or have a bit of fun. So I have a bit of fun. \n\nOh thank you for the verbal offer, unfortunately seller, per our written contract will only review offers in writing. Additionally they will only review offers from people who have seen the property. Also it is illegal to pay a non licensed individual a commission and unless you are purchasing with an FHA/VA Loan you're capped at 6% In closing Costs generally. Also you sent me proof of funds and said you would be cash. \n\n\"Oh no, that's the statement from my father, we have the same name. I would be financing. You have to present my offer to the Seller.\"\n\nOk so you provided me proof of funds under false pretenses to see my Sellers home? Also you apparently have either received bad advice or no advice and it doesn't sound like you've spoken with a lender to understand your limits within financing. At this time I think it best to advise you to seek proper representation and without a valid approval we won't be showing you the property, per my seller instruction. \n\nIt's at this time he loses his mind 😂 \" You can't stop me from seeing it, I'll call your seller directly, you're just a greedy ba****** and I'll report you. \n\nI end the call by telling him I have no duty to him, maybe he should educate himself and based on his temper I would no longer feel comfortable meeting him. (I've been assaulted). Wished him the best and disconnected. \n\nDude called my broker and my broker told me he almost had to call the cops because the guy threatened to break into my sellers house. \n\nPeople are crazy.

You’re standing here in a wife beater and carrying a case of beer at noon on a Monday. You can find a fucking time to come back when they aren’t on their lunch break!!

The guy who called (another very young adult) was gobsmacked, said his friend shot himself. We got the pertinent info and then this kid just started asking us to call his mom. He had tried to call her first and she didn't answer.\n\nWe respond, male in the driver's seat of a car, GSW to head, appears self inflicted, corroborated by the caller and two other males on scene. He had vitals (not that it changes anything; my agency transports *every* witnessed code no matter what) so they transport to the nearest trauma hospital. An hour later after notifications were made, the OIC calls in that he is deceased. \n\nAll of this, while sad and tragic for the guys on scene and especially the victim's family, is pretty cut and dried. It was somewhat odd that there were three other guys on scene who could confirm a suicide but nothing really eye catching.\n\nLater that night we got the full story. At around 0100 our victim calls three of his buddies and says \"we are getting food, I will pick you up.\" He does and they get food and are cruising through town bullshitting. Normal night for young guys. \n\nA bit later after some cruising around, the victim says he wants to show them something. So he drives to a random street in town, stops in front of a random house and parks the car. Without a word, he pulls out a gun and with no hesitation puts the gun to his head and shoots himself in the head with his three friends in the car with him.\n\nHe never said a word.

      "text": "So whenever I needed to shut off water in the house (either for vacation reasons or for maintenance/etc) I felt like I had to apply the power of Odin to my shutoff valve (bottom of the first picture) just to turn the stupid thing. It's 20+ years old and the original builder special.\n\nAfter advice from this group, I finally decided to get a plumber in to properly install a ball valve shutoff just past the meter. I'm leaving the old shutoff before the meter alone since I'm not really allowed to mess with it anyways. It will just stay in the on position from now on.\n\nNow, shutting off the water isn't a worrisome event and it's super easy to use.\n\nI know this is super basic and I'll probably get downvoted here but I wanted to say thank you to people for their advice and not shaming me with such basic questions.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI got some great comments below and just want to clarify:\n\n1. I have a shutoff valve outside but only the city can touch that one\n2. I have a shutoff valve just before the meter in the picture above. That one is just tough to use so i wanted an easier way. Hence, adding a ball valve down the line after the meter.\n3. If I want to replace the valve before the meter, I will need to get the city and come and shut off the water at the curb, do the work, then call them back out again. So I will be without water for a couple days at a minimum.\n\nHope this clarification helps.\n\nEDIT2: Forgot to update with the bill. Came to CAD$360-ish inclusive of taxes. I know this is basic for many of you but this was great peace of mind for me.",

She only spoke Spanish (I'm fluent), and she was fucking terrified that we'd send an ICE officer over there while she was getting patched up by ambo.\n\nI assured her that no, that's not how this works; my county (I'm on the west coast) doesn't do that. It's not our job, and our chief has straight up said that we won't be cooperating with ICE unless absolutely necessary. She seemed a little reassured by this.\n\nIt's already so hard for DV victims to seek help. The fear of getting deported/getting their families deported is making it worse. I don't even want to think about how many other victims are keeping their mouths shut because of this. I'm not trying to be political here; this is just the fact of the matter in my area.\n\nOh, and for the cherry on top? I also got a call demanding we send an officer out to investigate \"three illegals.\" The caller insisted that because these people were speaking Spanish amongst themselves and \"acting suspicious,\" they were illegals. Here's the thing: this caller had an accent thicker than molasses. \n\nEdit to add: I had hoped that the second call would illustrate why the current political climate makes it harder for legal immigrants to get help as well.

I have a hard time understanding something without being able to relate it to something practical that I encounter in day to day life.\n\nI understand that a docker file is the blueprint to create a docker image, docker images can then be used to create many docker containers, which are replicas of the docker images. Kubernetes could then be used to orchestrate containers - this means that it can scale containers as necessary to meet user demands. Kubernetes creates as many or as little (depending on configuration) pods, which consist of containers as well as kubelet within nodes. Kubernetes load balances and is self-healing - excellent stuff.\n\nWHAT DO YOU USE THIS FOR? I need an *actual* example. What is in the docker containers???? What apps??? Are applications on my phone just docker containers? What needs to be scaled? Is the google landing page a container? Does Kubernetes need to make a new pod for every 1000 people googling something? Please help me understand, I beg of you. I have read about functionality and design and yet I can’t find an example that makes sense to me.\n\nEdit: First, I want to thank you all for the responses, most are very helpful and I am grateful that you took time to try and explain this to me. I am not trolling, I just have never dealt with containerization before. Folks are asking for more context about what I know and what I don't, so I'll provide a bit more info.\n\nI am a data scientist. I access datasets from data sources either on the cloud or download smaller datasets locally. I've created ETL pipelines, I've created ML models (mainly using tensorflow and pandas, creating customized layer architectures) for internal business units, I understand data lake, warehouse and lakehouse architectures, I have a strong statistical background, and I've had to pick up programming since that's where I am less knowledgeable. I have a strong mathematical foundation and I understand things like Apache Spark, Hadoop, Kafka, LLMs, Neural Networks, etc. I am not very knowledgeable about software development, but I understand some basics that enable my job. I do not create consumer-facing applications. I focus on data transformation, gaining insights from data, creating data visualizations, and creating strategies backed by data for business decisions. I also have a good understanding of data structures and algorithms, but almost no understanding about networking principles. Hopefully this sets the stage.",

      "title": "Thinking of Becoming a Realtor? Here's the Ugly Truth (From Someone in the Trenches)",
      "text": "Let me save you some time and heartache. If you’re thinking of becoming a Realtor because you saw someone on Instagram driving a G-Wagon and holding a “Just Sold” sign, pump the brakes. I’ve been in this business for a few years now and I’m here to give you the unfiltered, no-BS version of what this career is really like.\n\n1. 80% of new agents are gone within 2 years.\nWhy? Because this isn’t a job—it’s a business. There’s no salary, no sick days, no health insurance. It’s commission-only, which means if you don’t close, you don’t eat. Most people don’t have the discipline, savings, or stomach for that.\n\n2. Nobody trusts you in the beginning.\nYour friends and family will say they support you—until they list with someone else. It hurts, and it happens more than you think. You have to prove yourself before anyone gives you a shot, which means cold calling, door knocking, begging for referrals, and hearing “no” more times than you can count.\n\n3. You're not selling homes—you're running a full-blown business.\nYou’re the marketer, the social media manager, the customer service rep, the negotiator, the transaction coordinator, the accountant, and more. If you don’t have the money to outsource those tasks, guess what? You’re doing all of them. And most of your day will be spent doing everything except showing homes.\n\n4. It takes months (sometimes years) to make consistent money.\nLet’s say you do get a listing. Congrats. You’ll work your ass off staging it, marketing it, holding open houses, then it sells… and you get paid maybe 45 days later. That one check? It needs to last, because you might not close another deal for a while.\n\n5. Your time is never your own.\nForget weekends. Forget holidays. Forget relaxing nights. Buyers and sellers want your attention on their schedule. And if you’re not responsive? They’ll move on to the next agent who is. Real estate doesn’t care about your work-life balance.\n\n6. The emotional rollercoaster is savage.\nYou’ll spend months nurturing a client who ghosts you at the last second. You’ll get into escrow only to have it fall apart days before closing. You’ll have to be a therapist, a firefighter, and a miracle worker—daily.\n\n7. The market is oversaturated.\nEveryone and their cousin is a Realtor now. There are 1.5+ million agents in the U.S., and only a small percentage of them are doing meaningful volume. It’s a noisy, hyper-competitive space where people will undercut you just to get a listing.\n\n8. And here’s the kicker: AI is coming for all the weak agents.\nIf you think this job is about opening doors and filling out contracts, you’re already replaceable. AI is getting better by the day—automating paperwork, analyzing property data, writing listing descriptions, and even doing showings virtually. In a few years, the agents who bring no unique value, no deep market knowledge, and no people skills will be gone. Tech doesn’t need sleep, it doesn’t take a commission, and it doesn’t forget to follow up.\n\nSo if you’re thinking of jumping into this thinking it’s quick money, easy sales, or a “fun” job—don’t. This business is a meat grinder, and most of you won’t make it.\n\nBut if you’re obsessed with real estate, resilient as hell, and willing to sacrifice time, money, and comfort to build something real? Then maybe—just maybe—you’ve got a shot.\n\nFor everyone else, stick to watching Selling Sunset. It’s safer.\n\n—A tired Realtor who’s still in the game (for now)",

      "text": "Just had the craziest experience I need to share in case it ever happens to you. Longtime lurker but this was too wild not to post.\n\nSo I got a call last week from this sweet elderly couple wanting to sell their home of 40+ years. Classic story - downsizing, moving closer to grandkids, etc. The house was a beautiful mid-century in an area that's absolutely blowing up right now.\n\nHere's where it gets weird. When I went for the initial walk-through, the husband (let's call him Frank) was super friendly but his wife (we'll say Martha) seemed really hesitant. Like, she'd agree to everything but I could tell something was off.\n\nFast forward to listing day. I'm there early to stage a few things and Martha pulls me aside looking totally stressed. Turns out, she didn't want to sell AT ALL. Frank had basically steamrolled her into it because their kids thought it was \"time.\" The poor woman was in tears talking about her garden and how all her memories were in that house.\n\nI made a call I've never made before - I pulled the listing THAT MORNING. Told Frank we needed to talk. The three of us sat down and I basically mediated their first real conversation about this move in months.\n\nTurns out, they could actually afford to keep the house AND get a small condo near the grandkids (they had way more equity than they realized). Frank just assumed selling was the only option because \"that's what old people do.\"\n\nLong story short - they're now my clients for buying a small vacation property instead, Martha gets to keep her garden, and I actually ended up with a more profitable commission structure in the end.\n\nMORAL OF THE STORY: Sometimes your job isn't just to sell houses, it's to make sure your clients are actually making the right decision. I could have pushed forward and made a quick commission on a hot property, but I'd have hated myself for it.\n\nAnyone else ever have to pump the brakes on a listing that was technically \"ready to go\" but just felt wrong?",

Sometimes the $10M clients are easier than the $500k ones. They're usually crazy busy and just want you to handle everything. No 2am texts about cabinet hardware. No Sunday morning panic calls about anythinggg.\n\nBut here's the trap: Don't get comfortable just because they're wealthy. Had a $4M deal fall apart last week because another agent gave them a \"better story\" about a different property. These clients aren't buying shelter they're buying an experience.\n\nAnyone else notice this pattern with luxury clients The psychology is fascinating.",

You want to prove your skills in Kubernetes? Cool. But apparently, first you need to prove you own a luxury apartment, live alone in a soundproof bunker, and don’t blink too much.\n\nLet me break this down for the CNCF and their sanctimonious proctors:\n\nNot everyone has a dedicated home office.\n\nNot everyone can afford to book a quiet coworking space or even a hotel for a whole night just to take your absurdly strict exam.\n\nNot everyone lives in a country where stable internet is guaranteed, or where the \"exam spyware\" even runs properly.\n\nAnd some of us are disabled, neurodivergent, or otherwise unable to sit still and silent in front of a single screen while being eyeball-tracked by an AI that treats a sneeze like a felony.\n\n\nYou know what happens when I try to take the exam from my living room — which, by the way, is also my office, bedroom, and kitchen?\n\nI get flagged because someone walked past the door.\n\nI get banned for “looking away” to stretch my neck.\n\nI get stressed out to hell before the exam even starts, just trying to pass the ridiculous room scan.\n\nAnd then if the proctor’s software crashes, guess what? No refund. No re-entry. No second chance. Just another $395 down the drain.\n\n\nOh, and let’s talk about ableism, shall we?\n\nPeople with ADHD, autism, mobility constraints, chronic pain — you’ve built a system that excludes them by default. Can’t sit still? Can’t control your eye movement? Can’t guarantee your kid won’t cry in the next room?\n\nToo bad. No cert for you. Try again with a different life.\n\nThis isn’t “security.” It’s elitism wrapped in bureaucracy.\nYou know who passes these exams easily? People in tech hubs, with quiet apartments, corporate backing, expensive equipment, and no roommates.\nYou know who gets flagged, banned, or priced out? Everyone else.\n\nSo here’s a wild idea:\nMake it fair. Make it accessible. Make it human.\n\nOffer test centers.\nOffer accommodations.\nStop treating remote exam-takers like criminals.\nAnd while you’re at it, stop pretending like this system represents “the future of cloud.”\n\nIt represents the past, just with more invasive surveillance.\n\nSigned,\nOne very pissed-off, cloud engineer\nWho doesn’t need your cert to prove it\nBut wanted the badge anyway, before you made it a gatekeeping farce",

      "text": "Early this year I got called back to the dev side after a decade doing infra. Basically a *staffing incident* recently left us without a lead dev and my name got pulled from the hat to fill in.\n\nAnd the process has just reminded me how easy like 95% of modern development work is. Let me guess, we have to write CRUD methods for a new object type and shove it in the database. Oh, then the offline worker job has to call an API somewhere once a day for each row? Wow, how novel.\n\nThe best part is every time I add a new button to the app which turns some text from red to green, the business jerks me off like I've just invented gzip compression or something. Meanwhile on the infra side no one knows you exist until you're up Saturday morning at 2AM trying to find which asshole pushed an N+1 query on Friday.\n\nMost of all it refreshed my perspective on why devs are so helpless any time they have to touch infrastructure. The scope of dev work is so narrow and context-independent that a verbatim solution probably already exists in 10,000 different stack overflow answers and just needs a find+replace. Now they even have a robot button in VSCode that does that for them.\n\nMeanwhile for infra you get like two systems deep and already you're source-diving some golang repo on github just to figure out what shape of yaml object the system will actually accept. Or `strace`ing a system component so old that Stallman himself might have written it, just to figure out which syscall it's been hanging on for the last hour. If you need help you'd better hope someone on the team has hair grayer than yours, otherwise you're completely out to sea. Because you sure as hell can't google the specific mixture of platform, provider, and runtime that makes up your infrastructure cocktail.\n\nSo the next time a dev says the pipeline is broken because they elected not to read the line that said \"syntax error at shittycode.js line 69\". Or opines on how the infrastructure is unstable because they sunk the database with a one-thousand line query that dodges every index you've ever set. Or suggests that devops is blocking their new paradigm-shifting code release (it adds a circular progress indicator) just because the dependency scanner is red.\n\nTell them \"just put the API methods in the bag, bro.\"",

No paid ads, no begging for views.\n\nMost of them had never made a real estate video before, so it turned into a fun, collaborative thing 😄. And the property FINALLY got attention and managed to get a few showings in the same week.\n\nIf you have a listing that has gone quiet, this might be worth trying, because it worked for my listing!\n\nLet me know if you ever tried this or if you would give it a shot.",

It was my name on the menus and my pride wouldn't let my places of employment fail.  \n\nOver the years i experienced coming home to my wife crying because I had to shower, go to bed, and wake up st 5a to go back.  I missed my kids school plays and concerts.  The 1000s of times I came home to cold dinner in the fridge, I missed having dinner with my family again... But this was all I knew.  I was in my 40s, a career change now wouldn't keep the mortgage paid. \n\nI tried different things- healthcare, higher ed... nope..  no change.  Still the same grind but with even more toxicity in some cases.  So I stuck with higher ed, because at least there were some \"breaks\" where things slowed down for parts of the year.  \n\nI kept watching Indeed.  Will my perfect job show up?  The job market worsened and I felt a deep depression.  I felt stuck.  Burnt.  Aging and fucking *stuck.*\n\nA few months ago something popped up that really piqued my curiosity.  A union job managing a grocery deli (a 14k yearly pay cut, but hourly pay with insanely good benefits.)  Immediately I started researching.  Were my skills transferable?  \n\nI applied.  I had to lie about family emergencies to go interview.  I met the GM.  (Great dude, we hit it off immediately.)  We talked about a day in my life at my work.  A day in the life of a hypothetical deli manager.  And they lined up.  Big time.\n\nI accepted the position two days after interviewing.  Asked for a three week start date so I could enjoy a 1 week breather.   They obliged without hesitation.  \n\nThe job-  holy shit, folks.  I get to schmooze with the customers.  We talk about food.  There is a lot of surprise in customer's eyes as i suggest cheeses to go with their freshly sliced meats and give advice on recipes to take them over the top...\n\nI work 7 to 3.  I am *forced* to take the two 15 minute mandated breaks.  I had to get used to my staff not hustling 24-7, but shit, we get everything done, and our clientele genuinely seems thrilled with our foods.  I get to use my skills with our shrink (waste in the chef's world) and spread it into corporate recipes, helping the bottom line. Easy.  \n\nI will always miss the creativity, but that desire is fulfilled in a different outlet... cooking dinner for my family every night.",

Sorry for the long text ahead of time!\n\nTLDR: If you feel stuck in accounting, learn PowerQuery\n\n——\n\nGraduated from college about 7 years ago with my bachelor’s in accounting, quickly got my CPA and joined a middle market firm in audit. I absolutely dreaded it. Somehow lasted 2 years.\n\nMoved into a revenue analyst role, hated it. Lasted 8 months.\n\nMoved into a senior accounting role at a tech company doing technical research and Month-End close shortly after Covid began, enjoyed it more but still dreaded a lot of the job, but felt stuck because it paid well so I “needed” to stay. Lasted 2 years.\n\nTried pivoting out of accounting by going into financial services briefly. Lasted 7 months before I needed a larger salary again, so I again moved back to accounting.\n\nAt this point I was getting pretty depressed. All this time spent studying for the CPA, working weekends, etc. \n\nThese accounting jobs are paying low $100k’s, so by most standards I’m doing pretty well, but internally I had zero fulfillment from my work. I felt trapped in accounting with no easy way to pivot. I took another senior accounting role at a mid-size company, and this one changed my career trajectory.\n\nThe CFO pulled me into his office on my first day as a “get to know eachother”, and said “if you come in here and find a better way to do something, don’t ask, just do it.” For me, this opened the flood gates.\n\nAbout a year ago I started researching a lot on the topic of automation in accounting, and kept coming across PowerQuery, which I hadn’t heard of before. \n\nEvery day I was using PowerQuery to save time. This caught the eye of my team and soon I was doing live demos on PowerQuery for the whole finance and accounting function.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was on ChatGPT trying to speed up my queries, and went down the SQL rabbit hole, and later the Python rabbit hole. I was soon pulling out financial data from SQL to feed my completely automated Python reconciliations, completing hours of mundane work in seconds.\n\nI love doing this so much that I am now on the data analytics team, got a $20k pay bump, and this type of automation work is all I do.\n\nFrankly, finding PowerQuery completely changed my career and instilled a lot of fulfillment and happiness into my day to day. If you feel stuck in accounting, learn PowerQuery.\n\n",

I enjoy helping people the most but there isn’t much room to raise a family for helping people for free so I’m gonna stick to my career in the meantime. \n\nEDIT3: like I’ve said though, I will not be helping any of you through the process of actually getting started because there are way to many of you asking for it.  I just wanted to open the door, now you have to do the research and see if it’s right for you",

If you’re doing deep dives / analysis, define success criteria of your initiatives, try and measure them (e.g., some of my less technical but awesome DS colleagues made their career of finding drivers of key KPIs, reporting them to key stakeholders and measuring improvement over time). In short, **prove you’re worth it**.\n\nA lot of the time, that means building a dashboard. Or doing proper data/software engineering. Or using GenAI.

      "title": "From Unemployed to a $58k IT Job in a Year: My Journey",
      "text": "I wanted to share my story to inspire those of you who feel stuck or are starting from the bottom. A year ago, I was completely unemployed, three months behind on rent, and facing a court order to either pay up or leave my apartment. My life was the very opposite of stable. \n\nI scraped together what I needed to stay in the apartment, and I took a dishwashing job to stabilize myself. It wasn’t glamorous, but it was exactly what I needed to keep going. Around the same time, I heard about the Google IT Support Professional Certificate. I decided to use what little stability I had from dishwashing to focus on earning that certification.\n\nWhen I finished, I started posting about it routinely on LinkedIn. That decision changed everything. A recruiter from Robert Half saw my posts and reached out with an opportunity: a four-month temp contract hanging wireless access points (WAPs) for schools in northeast Ohio—1300 of those. I took the job, did my best, and made sure to keep my resume updated with everything I learned.\n\nBefore that, my only real IT experience was a tech sales job with an ISP a few years back, where I occasionally reset passwords or rebooted modems. Still, I kept networking and applying. Posting updates on LinkedIn led to more opportunities, including one from Randstad. I accepted their offer, but just three days before my start date, it was rescinded because the organization froze all contracting services after their CEO was fired.\n\nThat could’ve crushed me, but I didn’t give up. I kept my resume sharp and continued posting. Eventually, a recruiter from my current organization found me on LinkedIn. They helped me prep for an interview, and I made the most of it. The result? A $58k job with a $3k relocation bonus that I started last month.\n\nThe funny thing is, my experience was minimal—just the Google cert and some AP installations. What got me here was mastering soft skills, learning to interview, and refusing to give up, even when things went sideways.\n\nHere’s what worked for me and might work for you:\n\n1.\tTake the first step, no matter how small – For me, that was a dishwashing job to stabilize my life and the Google cert to build momentum. Do NOT go into the grind saying what you aren’t gonna do. If you wanna bend the situation to your will, you have to be willing to do whatever it takes.\n\t\n2.\tLeverage LinkedIn – Share your journey, post your progress, and connect with recruiters. It works.\n\t\n3.\tStay resilient – Losing that first job offer hurt, but I kept going. Persistence really is key in this field.\n\t\n4.\tFocus on soft skills – You don’t need to know everything about IT right away. Being able to communicate, adapt, and think critically will set you apart.\n\nA year ago, I felt hopeless. Today, I’m in a role with more upward mobility than I ever thought possible, with a stable income and a clear path forward. If you’re struggling, I hope my story shows you that you can fucking do it. It won’t be easy, but if you keep at it, an opportunity WILL break. Good luck. ",

I tend to provide topical/local anaesthesia for bartholin cysts/abscess drainage and IV pain meds (which i also do for normal abscesses).\n\nBut talking to my gf, female friends/family/coworkers/patients, it seems the only analgesic used in the office is ibuprofen. For anything -- IUD insertion, cyst/abscess drainage, biopsy. A lot of these are at least somewhat invasive and definitely painful. I know conscious sedation isn't an option on the office, but topical lido and cervical blocks exist. It just seems more nicer.\n\nEDIT:  \n1. I've removed some of my more inflammatory wording, since i was definitely in a bad mood when i posted this.  \n2. I've also removed some of the procedures i initially listed as i was probably just misinformed.  \n3. To the many of you responding that you offer pain control or anxiolysis other than ibuprofen, i appreciate it. It would seem the women in my life and the patients i get in my ER are just unlucky with their physicians.  \n4. Pertaining to the people who've been kind enough and thorough enough to provide literature support, that's fair. In my own practice, i'm still erring on the side of offering meds.

They need to make the penalties for this quite severe. They were laughing and mocking him while simultaneously facilitating his drug addiction. Using your medical license to become a legal drug dealer should come with major criminal penalties. I'll be interested to see what his sentence turns out to be.

      "text": "https://patch.com/new-jersey/ridgewood/nj-surgeon-who-resigned-over-charlie-kirk-comments-calls-nurses-accusations\n\nThe article below:\n\n“BERGEN COUNTY, NJ — A doctor who resigned from a North Jersey hospital last week after a nurse reported his reaction to the assassination of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk disputed the accusations against him in a statement released Tuesday.\n\nSurgeon Matthew Jung said he \"do[es] not condone violence for any reason\" and said that the stories about him have resulted in \"a wave of racial slurs and death threats against me. Sadly, it also led to threats against other minority physicians I once worked alongside, and against the hospital itself.\"\n\nJung said that he resigned from the hospital on Sept. 15 not because he was guilty, but because he wanted the threats to end.\n\nPolitical violence against health professionals has been on the upswing, reports say.\n\nThe controversy began after media outlets reported that Lexie Kuenzle, a nurse at Englewood Hospital in Bergen County, filed a lawsuit in Bergen County Superior Court on Sept. 12, alleging that she was suspended after reporting Jung's comments in relation to Kirk's killing.\n\nFind out what's happening in Ridgewood-Glen Rockfor free with the latest updates from Patch.\nYour email address\nSubscribe\nKirk was assassinated during a stop on his \"American Comeback\" tour on the Utah valley University campus on Sept. 10. A suspect in the fatal shooting, Tyler Robinson, 22, was taken into custody two days later. READ MORE: 5 Things To Know About Tyler Robinson, Charlie Kirk's Accused Killer\n\nIn her lawsuit, Kuenzle alleged that when news was reported about Kirk's fatal shooting, \"In front of patients and staff, Dr. [Matthew] Jung cheered and publicly praised the murder.\"\n\nKuenzle said that she was concerned that a doctor who had taken the Hippocratic Oath had celebrated someone's death in earshot of other medical professionals and a patient.\n\nShe alleged that as a Christian, his comments created a \"hostile work environment.\"\n\nThe hospital responded with a statement on Sept. 13 saying that it had not fired Kuenzle—as some news outlets reported—but that it had suspended both Kuenzle and Jung in order to investigate the situation.\n\nTwo days later, the hospital sent a short statement saying that they had accepted Jung's resignation.\n\nAt the time, Jung did not give his side of the story publicly.\n\n\"I Am Also A Christian...'\n\nKuenzle's lawsuit noted that her employers were aware of her Christian faith and asked, \"What happened when a horrified Christian Nurse was the victim of Dr. Jung’s anti-religious rant? As a result of Plaintiff’s engagement in the protected activity above, she suffered an adverse job action.\"\n\nJung said in his statement on Tuesday afternoon that he, too, is a Christian, as well as a \"minority and queer\" man.\n\n\"Several hospital staff asked me who he was and why this [the assassination] might have happened,\" Jung said in his statement on Tuesday, giving his own account of that day. \"In trying to explain, I mentioned that his platform had included rhetoric that many – including minorities like myself and several of the staff – found discriminatory. I spoke about how hatred can fuel more hatred and often leads to violence. But I was in no way 'cheering' for Mr. Kirk to be shot and killed, as has been alleged.\"\n\nJung said, \"While his words have caused real pain for many, he did not deserve that kind of hatred – nor did racial minorities or those in the LGBTQ+ community who were targets of his rhetoric. Words are powerful – both his and mine. And I am deeply sorry I did not choose mine more carefully, especially as they’ve been so badly misrepresented.\"\"\n\n\"I am a minority and Queer,\" he said, \"two groups Mr. Kirk frequently targeted. But I also am a Christian, born and raised in New York who worked my way through college and then medical school. I dedicated my life to serving my patients with compassion at their most critical moments, regardless of their race, political beliefs, gender identity, or anything else. Those who have worked with me know me best. And amidst all the hatred and vitriol, I also have received a tremendous outpouring of support.\"\n\nHe said his discussion was with hospital staff, and that the nurse released a \"misleading narrative about what I said and meant. She did this while casting herself as the victim ... In fact, I am the one who no longer works at the hospital. She continues to seek the television limelight for her own publicity.\"\n\nEnglewood Hospital did not respond by press time when asked for a comment.”\n\nSounds like this started as a verbal misunderstanding at work, nurse doxxed him online, led to threats against him, coworkers, and hospital. And the hospital forced him to resign but kept the nurse….\n",

      "text": "I went into it because it was this or nursing and ya girl don’t do well with blood or death, and pursuing a field in a saturated, unstable job market was just out of the question because… I was poor. And I was good at math and the salary averages looked great, so objectively, I was in.\n\nWhen I was in college, I HATED accounting. I almost dozed off every single lecture cause it was so boring and my professors had the demeanor of stereotypical accountants (meek and monotoned). Being poor with no scholarships I worked the whole time as a student—sometimes even 2 jobs, and was always running around and exhausted. Straight C student compared to the As I always got in high school without trying. To be fair, I also just don’t really know how to study cause I’d never had to.\n\nMy confidence in my intelligence was depleted, everyone was going into big 4 internships (internship was expected to get the last credits necessary for the program to graduate), I really only landed mine VERY last minute mostly due to the unfortunate circumstances of the Firm partner and his inability to participate in the meet the firm sessions. I had no money to get into my MBA then get my CPA like the route they pushed everyone to do, and I honestly had no clue where to go from there. I really struggled with if this was the right path for me.\n\nWell, I’m in my late 20s now and I genuinely enjoy the work. I started a senior accountant role last week, was a staff for a little while before that and compared to other job markets I feel like we still fare pretty well. Hopefully my perspective isn’t too skewed, but I’ve hardly ever had a job gap—even with COVID, even now. The only time I’ve been out of a job was from a toxic workplace where they fired someone once a month and I got the wrong end of the roulette. (Also dreaded working there anyway) Even then, I found something within a couple months (went ham though, obv) and really thrived there.\n\nThe job is honest, I can quantitatively showcase my achievements (I’d suck at pitching myself otherwise), and I enjoy working with excel. A lot. lol\n\nDo you guys genuinely enjoy your work, and what do you do? Or is it that “job that pays you well enough to enjoy life outside of it” kind of thing? I like to think that mine can be both.\n\nEdit: I appreciate the positivity from (most of) everyone! I didn’t think this was such an uncommon post on this sub lmao but I’m glad to inspire and wish everyone great outcomes on their journey. Mine has not been the most well-paying, clear-cut or even lucky path, but I’m glad to call it my own and to know what it took to get here.\n\nOh and to all the miserable people in the comments trying to shame me for liking my life: I work 45 hours a week tops, but typically less than. The people I work with are wonderful and support me when I need it, I am getting paid comfortably, my schedule is flexy and I could start at 10am if I wanted, which I don’t cause I’m excited to contribute and am not burnt out. 💛 sorry for ya life though",

And while there is plenty of time left to determine whether or not you are capable of doing so, the reality is most of you could barely touch 40 without tapping out.\n\nThere isn't much of an emphasis on the reality of an 80-110 work week. Somehow many of you are convinced that you will break into this industry and begrudgingly work 110 hours a week, 7 days a week, holidays included, for 2 years and then what?... retire? \n\nWhile junior salaries are relatively high, it isn't millions of dollars. The people who end up at these BB or EB shops and work there for 2 years and move on to mega PE funds don't think about the hours. These people are machines and they could care less about WLB and also care a lot less about the comp.\n\n  \nEspecially considering that the comp becomes pretty negligible past $90k. While it is nice to make a shit load of money, you will realize that there is only so much you can do, especially when the only thing your salary goes towards is an uber black at 3 am back to your corporate apartment just to take the same uber back to the office at 4 am.\n\n  \nThe reality is, don't waste your time. If you have enough time to be scrolling through this sub, find another career path. You won't make it, and that's even if you get an interview, which you won't.\n\n  \nP.S. Employers don't give a shit if you did a goldman possibilities summit you look like retard putting that under experience\n\n",

They are trying to cut necessary programs and agencies to make up for the huge tax for the wealthy that Trump is trying to reinstate this year, along with privatizing those agencies to help the wealthy, and stop oversight of their misdealings. I was surprised that the AICPA speakers didn't at least question that there are zero government auditors and/or forensic accountants on the DOGE team doing these so called audits. Instead a bunch of child hackers/coders, who have very little experience and know nothing about the government are doing them. On top if that, the guy in charge, Elon, is a billionaire, who is also one of the largest government contractors, that gets government subsidies,  tax cuts, and contracts. HUGE red flags and conflict of interest, which is drilled into us CPAs and part of our rules &amp; regulations. I'm so very disappointed in the AICPA, as well as the lack of outcry from our community. Why aren't more accounting and financial professionals calling this crap out.

Because OF COURSE one MUST USE Spark to move 40 bits of data, god forbid someone thinks a firm has (*gasp!*) small data, even if the amount of companies that actually need a distributed system is less than the amount of fucks I have left to give about this industry as a whole.\n\nLuckily, I can soothe my rage by meditating during the downtimes, beacause testing code means that, if your cluster is cold, you have to wait between 2 and 5 business days to see results, meaning that each day one gets 5 meaningful commits in at most. Work-life balance, yay!\n\nSecond, the bane of any sensible software engineer and their sanity: Notebooks. I believe notebooks are an invention of Satan himself, because there is not a single chance that a benevolent individual made the choice of putting notebooks in production.\n\nI know that one day, after the 1000th notebook I'll have to fix, my sanity will eventually run out, and I will start a terrorist movement against notebook users. Either that or I will immolate myself alive to the altar of sound software engineering in the hope of restoring equilibrium.\n\nThird, we have the biggest lie of them all, the scam of the century, the slithery snake, the greatest pretender: \"yOu dOn't NEeD DaTA enGINEeers!!1\".\n\nBecause since engineers are expensive, these idiotic corps had to sell to other even more idiotic corps the lie that with these magical NO CODE tools, even Gina the intern from Marketing can do data pipelines!\n\nBut obviously, Gina the intern from Marketing has marketing stuff to do, leaving those pipelines uncovered. Who's gonna do them now? Why of course, the same exact data engineers one was trying to replace!\n\nExcept that instead of being provided with proper engineering toolbox, they now have to deal with an environment tailored for people whose shadow outshines their intellect, castrating the productivity many times over, because dragging arbitrary boxes to get a for loop done is clearly SO MUCH faster and productive than literally anything else.\n\nI understand now why our salaries are high: it's not because of the skill required to conduct our job. It's to pay the levels of insanity that we're forced to endure.\n\nBut don't worry, AI will fix it.",

      "text": "I thought the building envelope flair would be most appropriate since the tree penetrated the building envelope in two places!\n\nAnyways I'm just a decent DIY homeowner that bought a house with a tree growing through it. I know it was a carpenter from 1988 that did it; since I found date-stamped plywood underneath the gravel bed, and a smoked Marlboro Gold and spent match underneath that ply, ha! I've only seen super-skilled carpenters smoke Golds ...\n\nAnyways, I love following this sub in order to see the cool stuff you pros do; so I thought I'd just share this sort of outlandish thing now that I've completed the demo work and am gradually restoring the area. I know this isn't the sub for homeowner posts but I hope this is interesting enough for an exception!\n\nOriginally this was a tree penetrating a spruce sun deck that was then enclosed as a solarium (photo 5), with the tree remaining there. The existing deck knee wall was just used as the base for the solarium; and then Four Seasons replaced the whole original solarium in 2019. I tried to highlight the build details as well as the damage this whole thing caused over time in the captions to the photos, but happy to answer any questions if anyone has them. The damage was really two fold - 1) From the tree directly: water flowing down the tree penetrated the floor joists and subfloor and caused rot; and the tree growth and sway was really shaking things loose; 2) The 2019 solarium install was not the best, and has led to a lot of rot in the corners as water flows down the rafters and pools/drips in the corners.\n\nI suppose I would have kept it, but once I pulled off the decking underneath the house, I could see I only had about 3\" of space before the tree would hit my main beam given all the box joinery and such; so only about 5 years of tree growth before it would have to come out anyways.\n\nI'm almost to the stage where I can pull the ledgerboard back into the house and then start clamping and bringing the joists back in and putting hangers on them (lots of gradual floor jack twisting and stud levelling with wedges). Since the 'drift' of the ledgerboard has opened up some of the wall seams, I'd rather try to get everything back plumb and level vs just trying to secure it all in place. I put all that under-structure bracing in before the tree guys came in to remove it; since given the structural issues, I didn't want an errant sway of a multi-ton tree to send a chainsaw wielding arborist through my floor ... but it's also been super useful as I level and raise everything back to where it should be though!\n\nOf course, as a new homeowner, I'm kind of pissed to see all the hot-mud and poor paint patches the previous homeowner slapped in there to hide everything before I bought it ... I could see there were issues when I did my inspection (not that the inspector caught them), but didn't think it was this bad. Of course, you never know with water damage until you start demoing ...",

Long hours, close cycles, busy season cycles, all so you can be tossed to the side of the road via corporate restructuring, layoffs, offshoring, new leadership, private equity, etc…\n\nThe only routes which really seemed worth it long term in this profession were working for the government (which has absolutely been blown apart by the current administration) and/or potentially self employment.\n\nMy new role will be paying me only $70k in a LCOL area, but I have 15 weeks off, finish teaching at 2:30, and have all the time and energy in the world left to pursue self employment opportunities now.\n\nAccounting was supposed to be a stable role, but it (like pretty much every other white collar job) is under pressure like nothing I’ve seen before. As a teacher I’ll never have to worry about my job being sent overseas, or an AI robot teaching a classroom as if parents would ever accept that.\n\nCrunching the numbers, I’m essentially paid more on an hourly basis than most accounting managers/controllers especially considering the ones averaging 50-55+ hours a week if not more. \n\n•\tSalary: $70,000\n\t•\tContract Days: 187\n\t•\tDaily Rate: $70,000 ÷ 187 ≈ $374/day\n\t•\tHours per Day: 7.5\n\t•\tTotal Hours/Year: 187 × 7.5 = 1,402.5 hrs\n\t•\tHourly Rate: $70,000 ÷ 1,402.5 ≈ $49.9/hr (~$50/hr)\n\n•\tAnnual Hours: 52.5 × 52 = 2,730 hrs\n\t•\tHourly Rate: $130,000 ÷ 2,730 ≈ $47.6/hr (~$48/hr)\n\nI still think there can be rewarding careers in accounting, but it won’t be in corporate America or in large firms. Either go solo, find a small niche company/firm/practice, or explore what other public sector jobs might be worthwhile.\n\nThe purpose of this post isn’t to disincentivize ppl from pursuing accounting as a career, it’s to pivot the attitude and expectations. I already know and expect comments saying how I’m out of touch, or that I’m looking at things the wrong way. So be it, I’ve been at too many places now and every single one has managers, Senior Managers, Directors, VPs, etc… working every moment of every day. That’s not going to be me in my 30s and 40s, life is too precious. ",

      "text": "I have a casual position I pick up shifts at. They finally hired someone for a position they had been struggling to fill (undesirable hours) and I’ve worked with the NP who will be taking over 3x now. \n\nI’ll preface this by saying she is a genuinely nice person and I do like her as a person. I think she means well. I also have worked with many NPs who are competent and good at their jobs. \n\nBut “Susie” as we will call her, is not. She went to an online diploma mill for her NP school and although she has 20 years of RN experience, it doesn’t seem to help her much. She doesn’t know just the complete basics of care - everything from how to write a SOAP note (or how to even formulate an assessment and plan) to how to diagnose conditions, prescribe medications, just… anything. She can perform the mechanics of an exam but doesn’t seem to understand/recognize when there are abnormal findings (or when there are normal findings that are not abnormal). Even the questions she asks me make zero sense - instead of “45 yo M presenting with xyz, my ddx is abc, anything you would add?” Or whatever, it is “what should I put as my diagnosis in the computer?” (But she barely gives me any context.. where does she think the diagnosis comes from??) or “what should I write in the A/P?” I mean… your assessment and plan??\n\nI thought maybe it was nervousness at first and things would improve. But it’s been about 2 months and I’m not sure anymore. We had a patient come in interested in birth control and she asked me what she should do. I had to walk her through everything, from what history she should gather to how to decide what product to order. \n\nThe kicker is she will be working SOLO at this clinic once her “training period” is over - which will be over in a few weeks. I just don’t think her practicing solo is safe for these patients! Many of them are uninsured or underinsured to make things worse, so it’s not like she can easily refer everything out (not that that’s a great solution in the first place)\n\nMy mind is just boggled as I genuinely did not know there was an institution of higher education that would give someone an NP degree who has such little knowledge about practicing medicine! I have heard of the “diploma mills” but thought they were exaggerated tbh. \n\nI can see why physicians who work with someone like this might be horrified to work with any PA/NP in the future! \n\nI think at the minimum she needs to work somewhere where other physicians or experienced PAs/NPs are. She does have experience as an NP apparently (not in primary care) but I don’t understand what she was doing previously, as surely it required her to formulate a basic note. \n\nAnyway. Just had to vent. Feeling discouraged to even be a PA or “APP” after this experience. I think these schools should be shut down, they honestly take advantage of people and make everyone look bad. Our supervising physician came by to “visit” and I have never seen him in all my time working there, so I think someone has made him aware of the situation. He privately asked me my thoughts on her and sat in on her visits. He didn’t seem happy, but I can’t blame him. Thank goodness our institution requires supervision - I know there will always be docs who just sign their name and don’t care, but he does seem to genuinely care and in this case it really does matter that he does. \n\nJust.. ick. I hate the direction medicine is going. \n\n\n\n",

This is a very nice building in a world-famous location, not the nicest building in the zip code, but enviable for sure. Units range from $600k-$2mm. \n\nI met these buyers two years ago when they came to one of my listings in the building. We got to know each other, and then they made a joke of an offer which my seller and I couldn’t take seriously. Nothing came of that. \n\n——fast forwarding here—— \n\nLast month, a unit in the building that was under contract had their deal fall apart. They dropped the price to a shockingly low number to move it quickly. \n\nWe went to go look at it, and they demanded to make an offer on it that any reasonable person would be insulted by. 20% below list when the property is already listed at a very low number. Of course the listing agent called and chewed me out, angry he had to present it, sellers were pissed, blah blah blah. \n\nEventually, I got my buyers up to a number that I deemed acceptable to present, still too low, but only because I was willing to cut my commission request to the seller, which made the offer seem sort of acceptable. \n\nAfter a week of fine tuning the terms, the sellers accepted our deal and I woke up to an acceptance today. \n\nWe went into the unit today, and my buyers couldn’t stop saying awful, terrible things about the sellers. For no reason. I was so fucking livid that these people were so ungrateful, not to mention the stress I’ve gone through this past week. They were able to take advantage of the sellers situation to buy the property below market value, and the husband did nothing but complain when they are beyond lucky to get it for this price. \n\nI wanted to throw him off the balcony.

      "text": "I got permission to post this by my friend. One of my classmates and close friends just got caught purchasing a test banks for the ATI maternal newborn and fundamental exams. \n\n**For background:** Majority of the \"test banks\" you're seeing online are actually scams. We also had classmates spend hundreds purchasing ATI test banks and they ended up actually being the questions from either the practice exams, older versions, and just questions from dynamic quizzing. In all honesty, those are the students who are lucky though- they're just out a few hundred dollars. \n\nWhat happens when the real test is found online is a lot deeper though. My friend was one of the few students who actually managed to get an actual copy of the proctored exam. She got a 88 and a 100%. A few weeks went by and she thought she was in the clear. But ATI is incredibly thorough about exam security. \n\n**How was she caught?** The way they caught her wasn't because of her score. But they caught the individual selling the material. According to our professor who works for ATI, there's trigger words apparently for many questions that ATI use specifically for their exams. They apparently have employees whose sole purposes are to look for copies of their exam. And they're extremely litigious. Officers are able to submit a warrant to get the payment info on who the material was distributed to on the distributors bank account and laptop. This is viewed as a criminal investigation. My classmate paid via PayPal. Her name was on her PayPal account. \n\nNote: for websites likes student doc, chegg, and such,  it's actually written in their policies that the material cannot be used for blatant cheating. If a professor files an inquiry, they will readily hand over the account registration email and names for the credit/debit card info- even without a warrant. This is copyrighted material and large websites don't want to get sued. \n\n**What is the school/ATI doing about it?**\nShe was called in by the school and told that ATI has contacted the school regarding the infraction. She's being expelled and she was advised by the school to get a lawyer. ATI has already contacted the BON and she's likely going to see legal papers regarding the infraction. She will almost 100% be barred from attending any accredited nursing program and taking the NCLEX. She will never become a nurse. The school literally isn't doing anything except letting her go, ATI did everything. Other schools and students will likely be contacted because of this breach. \n\n**Why did she do it?**\nShe was failing the course. She was struggling and is on a waiting list to be evaluated for ADHD. Her mom is sick and she was overwhelmed and desperate. Now she wishes she just failed. It doesn't even matter. It's 5%-10% of our grade and the remediation is only if you fail both the exam and the course itself.  \n\nYes, she knows she was dumb. You guys don't have to say it. She knows she messed up. But if you think spending a few hundreds to pass the ATI is worth it, it won't be worth the thousands she will have to spend on a lawyer now. And never being able to become a nurse. \n",

      "text": "[Link.](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-staffing/hawaiis-largest-hospital-alerts-staff-after-imaging-backlog-reaches-8000-exams)\n\nHawaii’s largest hospital recently alerted staff after its backlog of unread medical images reached 8,000, according to a report published Thursday. \n\nQueen’s Medical Center in Honolulu—and others in the Aloha State—are grappling with significant shortages of both radiologists and technologists. The state needed at least 10 more rads as of last year, a number that has likely worsened in 2025, the University of Hawaii’s John A. Burns School of Medicine estimates. \n\nAmid these shortages, Queen’s Medical Center radiologists are prioritizing exams for emergency patients and individuals with upcoming appointments or procedures, Hawaii News Now reported [April 17](https://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/2025/04/18/radiology-workforce-shortage-hits-hawaii-hospitals-with-thousands-patient-scans-queue/). \n\n“Like other healthcare organizations in Hawaii and across the United States, we are facing a shortage of radiologists,” Darlena Chadwick, Queen’s Health Systems chief operating officer, told the TV station. “We are seeing high volumes of diagnostic imaging requests, which \\[tend\\] to be some of the sickest patients in our community. The care of our patients is our highest priority, and we are working diligently every day to address any delays.”\n\nChadwick said this includes active efforts to recruit additional full-time radiologists, along with bringing aboard telerad temps to work through the queue. Meanwhile on the technologist front, the Healthcare Association of Hawaii [estimated](https://www.hah.org/hwi) in January that there are about 160 open positions. This represents a 39% increase since 2022 and includes 49 ultrasound technologist job openings, a 24% vacancy rate. \n\n“Healthcare leaders are increasingly concerned about filling radiologic technologist and ultrasound technologist roles,” the association, which represents over 170 healthcare organizations in Hawaii, said earlier this year. “The demand for these professionals is growing, but because these roles require specialized education, employers struggle to find qualified candidates,” the HAH added, noting there was no sonographer training program in Hawaii at the time of the report.  \n\n[Indeed.com](http://Indeed.com) currently lists over 50 open radiology-related jobs in Hawaii including radiologist, tech, PACS administrator and nurse. Queen’s Health System is [advertising](https://www.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=920f90872ae5f748&amp;from=shareddesktop_copy) a salary of $840,000 for a general radiologist who’d work at its North Hawaii Community Hospital in Waimea. (That’s compared to a national average of $520,000, [Medscape](https://radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-management/radiologist-salary/radiology-rises-no-2-highest-paid-specialty-surpassing-cardiology-and-plastic-surgery-medscape) estimated last week.) The four-hospital system has 11 CT scanners and 7 MRI machines, according to the job listing. Queens wants a rad who’d work a 40-hour week on a hybrid basis with shifts ending at 3:30 p.m. at its 35-bed rural acute care facility. It’s also offering a $20,000 signing bonus, $25,000 for relocation and $4,000 annually toward CME. \n\nWhile providers nationwide are grappling with staffing challenges, Hawaii’s struggles may be more pronounced due to its isolation and high cost of living. As of January, the state had about 4,700 open healthcare positions, the Healthcare Association of Hawaii estimated. When adjusting for various factors, the tally was about 3,835 (or 14% unfilled), down from 3,873 (or 17% unfilled) in 2022. ",

      "title": "VP of Tech with 20 Yrs experience, i wanted to offer some advise to those new or looking to get into IT.",
      "text": "I've been browsing through this sub all morning and I've seen a ton of negative posts from burnt-out individuals. This can seem very discouraging to anyone looking to get into IT or new in the industry. This advice is only for those brand new or looking to get into IT.\n\nA single cert (such as A+) unfortunately isn't enough to be put on top of the list of candidates for a position. This is interesting and a bit unfair since, on paper, an A+ is technically more than enough for a level-1 helpdesk position (I personally still have and update my A+).\n\nIf you're looking to appear more well-rounded, skip the A+ and focus on the following:\n\n* **Microsoft 365 Fundamentals**, followed by **AZ900**\n* **Microsoft Office Specialist (MOS)** — focus on **Outlook** first, because it causes the most \"noise\" in a normal office.\n* Maybe add **Azure Fundamentals** or **AWS Cloud Practitioner**.\n\nIf I'm looking to hire an on-site level-1 technician, here’s what I’m looking for (and so are most IT Managers/Directors):\n\n**Appearance:**  \nHow are you dressed? Personally, I'm a metalhead with tattoos and a sleeve — but you'd never tell by looking at me because I cover it. Work isn’t the place to express yourself; it's where you go to make money. At minimum, dress business casual. Hair neat. Smell good. If you don’t know how to dress well (you’d be surprised how many don’t), get help. These days it’s affordable to look good — go to H&amp;M, Express, or any trendy store and ask the younger employees for advice. They’ll likely be more helpful than your relatives or significant other. You don’t need to wear a tie, but get clothes fitted to your body shape. Don’t wear clothes that are super baggy or shirts that are too tight — yes, I see this a lot.\n\n**Small lifehack:** Buy a work outfit and wear it around the house. You’ll get comfortable in it and won’t feel awkward wearing it to work. Dress nicer than your peers in the same position, and you’ll be taken more seriously by managers — I promise.\n\n**Communication:**  \nI want someone with a good demeanor, who’s well-spoken, helpful, and has common sense. This is huge. Friendly, but not overly social. When dealing with office staff, get in, get out — don’t linger. The IT industry has improved a lot but there's still that stereotype of the creepy awkward it guy whos going through your personal pics, just know this is still a thing, don't be that guy.\n\n**Technical Skills:**  \nI prefer someone who’s well-rounded over someone who’s hyper-specialized but unwilling to leave their comfort zone. This is where having a few foundational certs makes a difference. A big part of your job will be putting out small fires — like solving a printer issue or dealing with a dead laptop, RMA, recover data, setup the user with a new device and make it look like the old one did. etc... it depends on your job, but just know the more well rounded you are the better..\n\n**Resourcefulness:**  \nThis is HUGE. It's okay not to know something. What matters is how you handle it. I look for someone who can say, *\"I’m not sure what’s going on, but I’ll get back to you within X time,\"* then takes ownership, researches (whether through escalation or Google), and follows up with a resolution — without needing a babysitter. I hate the micromanaging culture!\n\n**Direction:**  \nIf you’re just getting into IT, you probably don’t know which branch of IT you'll end up in. That’s OK. I used to be a Linux Telecom Engineer before realizing there were better-paying opportunities in finance. Now I work for a Private Equity firm. Why? It pays more — that’s it.\n\n# Some things I wish I did sooner:\n\n* Get a mentor — ideally someone in a high-level position in the field you're aiming for.  for example, in cyber security it would be a CISO, Compliance Officer, etc.\n* If possible, get an internship, even doing low-level work. It’ll show you the path.\n* Talk to successful people in the branch of IT you want to enter. Burned-out people love telling you how bad it is — that’s often a reflection of their own life, not the industry.\n* Mentorship programs at mature companies are GOLD — take advantage.\n\nAvoid negative, salty people. I've read plenty of those comments here. Sure, bad days happen. But I’ll share this: In one of my previous jobs (and still as a consultant doing internal IT assessments and M&amp;A work), I developed a knack for spotting unhappy IT employees — the complacent, lazy, or those who lost their drive. Every profession that pays well requires *continuous* improvement. IT is no different. If you stop learning, someone will pass you by. It’s just how it is.\n\nKnow the difference between **perception and reality**. Some folks lie A LOT on their resumes. Some don’t lie at all. Find the balance. Also understand that **corporate politics will always play a role** in career growth. If you think just being technically good and keeping your head down will land you a $250k salary — you’re mistaken.\n\nPerception matters. That’s why dressing decently and having a well-rounded cert portfolio are important in the beginning. Also, realize that your resume might end up in front of a 25 year old HR person that doesn't know Jack Shit about IT and all she's thinking about is her drama with her bf and how she needs to find an outfit to go have drinks with the girls, **make it easy** for them to put you on the lists of candidates that should be interviewed, and this might mean pay for someone to review your resume but don't overly rely on this either.\n\nThis was supposed to be a short post 😅. If you made it this far and have questions, drop them — I’ll answer as best I can.\n\nEDIT: I'm trying to wrap my head around the few Chatgpt comments, do you think I didn't write this? In a way it's very fascinating because if you cant tell a human being wrote this post then we're all done for in the future lol.  \n",

Our objectors alleged that we wrote our campaign address rather than a home residence on the petition sheets themselves.\n\n**Q: Well, did you write the wrong address?**\nA: There are multiple places on the petition sheet and statement of candidacy that ask for “Place of Residence”, and in those areas, that’s exactly what we put—our residence. The area that’s being challenged simply says “Address”, with no indication of a specific type of address.\n\n**Q: When is the appeal hearing?**\nA: This Wednesday and Thursday, December 17th and 18th, and 10am and 11am, respectively.\n\n**Q: And wait, y’all are live streaming the event?

Are you a Democrat?**\nA: That’s a good question. My top policies: A 92% tax on billionaires, repealing the Pink Tax that unfairly forces women to pay more than men, raise salaries for teachers and farmers, recognize Palestinian Statehood and establish a government office to audit where United States weaponry is being sent and how it’s being used, and use funds from those taxed billionaires to establish universal healthcare, universal basic income, and bring wealth back to our middle and working classes.\n\n**Q: Where’s the Zoom link?**\nA: This is what we’ve been provided so far by the Cook County Circuit Court:\n\n1.

      "text": "A year ago, I landed what I thought was my dream job. Hybrid schedule, huge salary, and responsibilities and deliverables that were manageable. I had been with my prior company for seven years - I only left for the money. It was a very familial / buddy environment. I was comfortable with my DRs and my boss. I could freely express myself, and I gave them the same courtesy. \n\nAfter a few months at the new company, I started to recognize the strict, conservative hierarchy. Little things... On our WFH days, my start time was watched like a hawk. After being in the office at 5am to accompany an auditor on an inventory count, and staying until 6pm to finish our month end reporting package, the next day I slept in and was online at 9:30. I had no deliverables due that day, yet received an official warning. \n\nA month later, after a hurricane left most of the F&amp;A department without power, I was being badgered by the parent company to get them the financials, without the support of my team. \n\nA month later, it was a working Saturday. I signed on at 9am and was immediately chastised by my boss that \"everyone else has been online since eight\". I thought working Saturdays meant we simply got out shit done, no matter how, or when, we did it. This is when I started having doubts about the company / culture. \n\nI pressed through another six months. I had a freak month of February where I had a series of unfortunate events, involving medical and car issues. Prior to this, I had never missed an in office day. After the last instance, I texted my manager that \"I can't make this shit up - I am unable to make it to the office tomorrow because I'm dealing with this.\" Thirty minutes later, the VP fired me via text. \n\nI spent a day getting drunk, and then started the grind. Updated my resume and called every recruiter I knew, connected with a lot of new recruiters, and started applying for every job directly that I saw on LI. Less than 2 weeks after I was fired, the CEO of a company contacted me directly. Exactly two weeks after being fired, I had an interview with him. Two days later, I met the executive team. The next day, I received an offer, for the same salary I was at, with a guaranteed raise in six months. \n\nToday was three weeks since I was fired, and it was my first day at my new job. I already love it. \n\nGetting fired sucks. But it doesn't have to be the end of the world. I missed a paycheck and a half. We were able to live thru that by adjusting out budget and doing simple things like getting a one month extension on car, mortgage, and student loan payments. \n\nI realize this is not everyone's reality - but if you find yourself fired tomorrow, I hope my story gives you hope.

      "title": "A More Realistic Timeline to Becoming a Major Airline Pilot in 2025",
      "text": "\nI see a lot of posts on here about not being able to find a job right now as a pilot - so I wanted to discuss the aviation job market and see if I could set some more realistic expectations.\n\nI’ll lay out some of my personal experiences and my own timeline to give an idea of what it was like in the aviation industry before the hiring boom of 2022. \n\n2007 - I started flying gliders at age 14. At that time, the pilots that flew the tow-planes were making $5 per tow. Maybe doing 5-10 tows per day. 15-20 on the weekends if they were lucky. \n\nSome of these 25 year old guys had jobs at regional airlines like Mesa, Great Lakes etc, making minimum wage (likely $10-$30k/year). At the time, they said to me, “Don’t be a pilot, there is no pilot shortage. The pay sucks and it’s not worth it.”\n\n2011 - I start aviation college. (UND, then MSU). \n\n2015 - I graduated college, having spent the last four years getting my licenses. During that time, I flight instructed, towed gliders, flew skydivers, taught simulator courses at school, worked a part time job doing IT support. I wasn’t making hardly any money, but I was building flight hours any way that I could. \n\nI had 500 hours by the time I graduated, and I got a job at Star Marianas Air in Saipan (north of Guam). I flew there for 3 months and got an additional 200 hours. I was making ~ $30k-$50k during that time. \n\nSaipan was hit by a super-typhoon in 2015 while I was there, so after losing electricity/running water for a month, I packed up and left back to the mainland and applied at Cape Air.\n\n2016 - Cape Air hired me with my 700 hours and I made $13/hr flying for them. I was making $15-$30k/year, but hey, at least I was building hours quickly. \n\nI flew as a first officer at Cape Air for one year, getting me up to 1500 hours at the end of 2016. \n\n2017 - I got my ATP and started flying as a Captain at Cape Air. I was making ~ $70-$90k\n\nI flew for Cape Air until mid 2018, having brought my total flight hours up to about 2800.\n\n2018 - Because I had so many hours of multi-engine pilot in command, I was able to get hired to fly a Citation 560 jet at a small private jet company. My salary was $75-$90k.\n\nI flew that airplane from mid 2018-2020 1.5 years, only getting 500 hours during that time. \n\n2020 - I transitioned to the Citation X, which flew a lot more, flying from 2020 until mid 2022 bringing my hours up an additional 1300 over those 2.5 years, to a total of 4500. Salary was $100-$165k. \n\n2022 - I had finally gotten 1000 hours of turbine pilot in command time, and my application at Southwest Airlines (who I had been applying to for years) made it through, and I was accepted for an interview. \n\n2022 (November) - *nearly eight years* after graduating college with all of my licenses, 4500 hours, 1000 as a jet captain, I was hired at my dream airline at 30 years old (my class date was on my 30th birthday, so that was a nice birthday present). \n\nI consider myself EXTREMELY lucky for how this timing worked out. \n\nDuring the hiring boom of 2022, there were 60 people in my class at Southwest. Many of them were 23 years old and had never been a captain on a jet. Most of them had been first officers at regional airlines. \n\nThose 23 year olds hit the lottery. They had their choice of whichever airline they wanted, and a lifetime of airline money and benefits ahead of them. I doubt that there will be another hiring boom where the timing works out *that perfectly* for a very long time. \n\nWith the huge outflow of captains &amp; first officers from the regional airlines headed to the majors, it became clear that the regionals were struggling to keep people. They needed to incentivize their people to stay, so pay went way up. \n\nThe regionals became a place that you could stay and have a *career.*  The amount of money they were handing out with the hiring bonuses, retention bonuses, direct entry captains slots, etc. things were looking pretty good.\n\nThe word was out, the airlines were hiring and they were finally paying a decent wage. Everyone and their mother started flight training. \n\nMany of the people going through accelerated programs were able to hop out after instructing and get straight into a regional airline. Boom, right seat in a jet, making good money, that’s a great deal. You’re on the way to the majors in that seat. \n\nSeveral of these regionals had built in flow-programs to get you at a major airline eventually. However, with the influx of pilots filling these regional jobs, due to a variety of reasons, the major airlines began to slow their hiring pace. This resulted in people staying longer at the regionals and thus, the hiring also slowed. \n\nSubsequently, the market became flooded with freshly trained flight instructors trying to get to the regionals. \n\nWhen the majors begin hiring again (they are planning to ramp up in 2026), the slots will begin to open again. \n\nIt won’t be the floodgates like it was in 2022, but it will be more than it has been.\n\nWith some regionals and ultra low cost carriers struggling, there are many more highly trained and experienced airline pilots jumping ship who are available to be hired. The last hiring window at Southwest had thousands apply, and those that were accepted for interviews had hours in the 7000hr range. \n\nIt takes time, experience, grinding away - trying to get ahead any way you can, in order to make it in a competitive job market. \n\nThe airlines are planning to hire again in the coming years - they have to. There are a lot of retirements still coming. So in order to make it, you need to be resilient. You need to be patient. You need to work hard, fly and get your hours. Keep an eye out for the next best opportunity and keep applying. Keep current. Take your friends flying to keep your passion alive. \n\nAlways keep the end goal in sight, and know that no matter how many hours you get, or where you work, or how little money it is, you will probably *EVENTUALLY* make it. But it won’t be easy. It won’t be like winning the lottery like those 23 year olds sitting in a UA class, getting ready to upgrade to captain after getting their year of flying in, making a quarter to a half million dollars right away. \n\nIt’s going to take years. It’s going to be a journey. So take a moment to let that sink in.\n\nI have had an incredible career already - flying around the tropical Northern Marianas Islands, to the frozen tundra of Montana, flying the rich and famous to concerts and tournaments, towing gliders, throwing sky divers &amp; landing my dream job. \n\nTry to remember along the way that it’s a journey to get to where you’re aiming for, and you may as well try to enjoy it. Seriously - make the best of it. \n\nSome of my fondest memories were from when I was making $13/hr, living in a crash pad apartment with my other poor pilot buddies. We loved our jobs and the company culture, the people, the airplanes, and each other. We all knew it was going to take a while to get to our dream jobs, but we were determined and we were resilient. \n\nYears later, we are all flying at major airlines or doing that thing we had set our sights to get to. One of my former first officers from Cape Air is currently flying weather research planes into hurricanes like she always wanted to. \n\nBe patient. Be determined. Be resilient. \n\nYou are walking down the street and you hear a plane fly over, what do you do?\n\nIf you answered “Well, I look up and see what kind of plane it is!” Good. You have the passion for this - and you *will find a way* to make it work. \n\n——————\n\nQuick reality check. \n\nI have flown with several people over the years that simply had the timing all wrong. They started flight lessons back in the day, no one was hiring when they finished school. They struggled to get even flight instructing jobs.\n\nAfter making it to the regionals, they were stuck. Minimum wage, commuting, being treated terribly, only to get furloughed after 9/11.\n\nClawing their way back to work, their airline goes out of business and they’re back on the streets. \n\nThey got hired on at another regional, starting their seniority at the bottom again. \n\nThe 2008 financial crisis comes around and with it,  another round of furloughs. \n\nTheir airline isn’t looking like it’s going to make it, so they change to corporate flying for some job stability.\n\nThe thing with corporate flying, is that it’s a lot harder than airline flying (objectively). You need to file the flight plans, clean the plane, load the bags, call for passenger transportation, etc. \n\nAt this point, they’re in their late fifties, having never made it to the major airlines like they wanted. They feel kind of stretched out thin, and at this point they know that they are just one of the unlucky ones where the timing just wasn’t in their favor. \n\nIt can happen. \n\nI wanted to share this to let you know that there are extremes in this profession, just like all the others. There are peaks and valleys. You will likely fall somewhere between the lottery winners and the people that had very poor timing.\n\nI consider myself to be close to one of the peaks. \n\nWhether you just started training, or if you’re a CFI struggling to make ends meet, or a regional captain begging to get to a major - just remember:\n\nBe patient. Be resilient. Be determined. Enjoy the journey, but keep striving towards the destination. \n\nPS- for the love of God, if you are ever invited to go sailing on someone’s boat:, *no talking about airline contracts/work until you’re off the boat*",

      "text": "It’s been 7 years since I left J.P. Morgan, and some distance from my banking days have offered me some perspective. Here's my take\n\n**Definitely worth it if you are:**\n\n1 – Looking for the absolute fastest learning pace possible\n\nNo other job throws you into billion–dollar deals with exposure to C–suite execs immediately upon graduation. You’re also working twice the hours of a normal job, so the rate at which you learn will be twice your peers.\n\n2 – Aiming to break into the buy–side (Hedge funds, PE, VC)Banking is still the #1 gateway to becoming an investor because of the fundamental technical skills you develop. All other paths to the buy–side are much more challenging (besides VC).\n\n**Might be worth it if you are:**\n\n1 – Unsure what you want long–term but want optionality\n\nIf you’re young and just graduating, it’s okay if you don’t know what you want to do after banking. So many doors open for you that after some exploration, you are bound to find your way.\n\n2 – Doing it ONLY for the money\n\nWorking in banking just a few years to pay off loans or make some money quickly is (perhaps unsurprisingly) a very strong motivator. But unless you have a genuine interest in finance, you will eventually burn out as the lifestyle grinds you down.\n\n**Probably not worth it if you are:**\n\n1 – Hoping for passion–driven work right away\n\nJunior banking roles are deal–focused, not mission–driven. Banking can lead to purpose–driven careers as you get more senior but moving logos around as an analyst at 2am won’t feel meaningful in the moment.\n\n2 – Prefer creative, highly unstructured environments\n\nThe banking environment is hierarchical, process–driven, and rigid. If you thrive when you can experiment and think outside the box, you’ll likely feel boxed in as a junior banker.\n\nPersonally, if I could go back in time, I would still start off my career with a few years in banking because of everything I learned.\n\nHope this is helpful - let me know what you guys think too.",

      "title": "8 years in government. You know what? I’m not leaving. ($652k net worth)",
      "text": "As a foreword, I want to acknowledge the many dedicated public servants who, through no fault of their own, are subject to RIFs or are in limbo after being fired and then reinstated. I delayed my annual post significantly this year because it didn’t feel right to do with all the probationary firings happening. I wish all of you the best.\n\n---\n\nTL;DR: I followed this sub in college, decided fuck PA, and started at the federal government in 2017 straight out of college. Work is reasonable(ish). Life is great. My net worth has gone from ($20k) at graduation to $652k as of 12/31/24. My wife’s (elementary teacher turned admin assistant) net worth has grown to $304k. We also have joint assets totaling $14k, giving us a household net worth of $970k for the year ended 12/31/24. We’re both 31. Government jobs might not pay as much as PA and industry, but there's still plenty of room for success.\n\n**Career:**\n \nI work as a financial auditor for the federal government. My OPM career code is 0511 for those interested. My day-to-day work is exactly the same as PA audit work. I have 8 years of experience now. I will always be grateful to this sub for lifting the curtain on the nature of PA work and for pointing me towards a government job. Around 10 years ago (scary to think about) in a thread about internships someone commented that government internships are often overlooked. On a whim I went over to USAJOBS.gov to see what federal internships were available, applied to several, and the rest is history. This post is partially to be that for the next generation of students.\n \nI started out making $60k. Last year my salary was $112k, however my final pay stub for 2024 showed $121k grossed due to overtime pay and student loan repayment benefits. Since then I both took a pay cut due to relocating to a MCOL area and also got a raise due to a promotion to GS-13, the net effect putting me at $118k. I don’t have a masters or a CPA. I considered becoming a CPA after I started working but quickly decided against it. I spent my free time after work as actual free time and met my now wife instead :).\n \nIf you want to climb the ladder quickly government is absolutely not the place to go. I went into it expecting a very slow climb and even I was starting to get disillusioned with the growing gap of my job responsibilities vs title and pay. $118 for 8 years’ experience in a MCOL is nothing special. My peers who went PA are certainly leaps and bounds ahead of me in salary and title. However, it’s more than good enough for me. When I picked accounting, my goal was a career that paid me ‘enough’ to live well, while giving me the best work-life-balance possible. A federal career has absolutely provided that. Any large increase in salary would probably come with a decrease in work-life balance, and that’s simply not worth it to me.\n \n**Work-Life balance:**\n \nExcellent. I work 40-hour weeks nearly year-round. I earn 4 weeks PTO and 2.5 weeks sick leave each year, in addition to 10 federal holidays. Like last year, this past busy season I had about 4 weeks again where I needed to work 60-hour weeks. I’m really not a fan of having to work OT, but the short-ish duration and 1.5x pay makes it bearable. \nMy job is still classified as remote and because of that we were able to move out of the DC area since my 2024 post. Remote work is the single best quality of life work benefit I’ve ever had and is a huge reason I haven’t jumped ship.\n \nOne of the other nice perks is that vacations are truly vacations. I've never had a boss expect me to work or be available when out on PTO. When I’m out of the country it’s literally illegal for me to check my work email. How’s that for forced work-life balance?\n \n**Personal Finance:**\n \nI found the /r/financialindependence sub in college too and decided I wanted to retire early. I made retirement contributions a priority and have maxed out my TSP (gov 401K), IRA, and HSA every year since 2017. It took quite a bit of effort the first couple years but my salary grew quickly. Those first few years of contributions set us up for life. If I dropped my TSP contributions to 5% and we stopped all other contributions, our combined retirement savings are on track to still grow to ~$6.5M (all projections in inflation-adjusted, 2025 dollars. 7% growth rate) by the time we hit age 57.\n \nWe're at around a 43% savings rate right now. We don't feel like those contributions currently hold us back though, so we still make them. With our current savings rate we’re on track to have ~$4.1M by age 45, though we’ll probably back off on our savings well before that due to lifestyle changes like kids. Halving our savings rate starting today would put us at ~$3.3M at 45, which should still be more than enough for us to retire if we wanted.\n \nThe biggest factor (beyond making enough money TO invest, which we’re grateful we do) is investing early. Investing $1k/mo for 10 years from age 25-35, then nothing from age 35-65 results in more money (~$1.4M) than investing $1k/mo for 30 years from age 35-65 (~$1.2M).\n \n**Net Worth:**\n \nThe S&amp;P500 was up ~25% in 2024, so my net worth jumped to $652k. My wife’s net worth jumped to $304k. We also have joint assets totaling $14k, giving us a household net worth of $970k for the year ended 12/31/24. With the market volatility we’ve crossed the $1M threshold many times, both before and after 12/31/24.\n \nOur net worth figures do not include any real assets. It's financial accounts (retirement, brokerage, cash, etc.) only. We do not own any real-estate and continue to rent a single-family home instead. Even in our MCOL area it’s cheaper to rent a SFH than buy. We are the proverbial couple that chooses to rent and invest the difference. \n \nEven though we’re married, I plan to continue posting annual updates outlining my accounts (to demonstrate how I’m progressing with a federal accounting career). We plan to keep our accounts mostly separate, which makes record keeping easier.\n \nHere is my updated net worth tracker.\n\n|**ASSETS**|**12/31/2016**|**12/31/2017**|**12/31/2018**|**12/31/2019**|**12/31/2020**|**12/31/2021**|**12/31/2022**|**12/31/2023**|**12/31/2024**|\n:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|\n|Cash (incl HYSA)|$ 2,576|$ 6,562|$ 15,272|$ 26,022|$ 20,320|$ 26,334|$ 32,257|$ 43,895|$ 47,273|\n|TSP|$ -|$ 22,448|$ 41,213|$ 79,546|$ 124,048|$ 178,928|$ 168,494|$ 241,445|$ 327,007|\n|Pension contributions (refundable)|$ -|$ 2,536|$ 5,880|$ 9,559|$ 13,460|$ 17,498|$ 21,743|$ 26,302|$ 31,194|\n|HSA|$ -|$ 3,535|$ 6,565|$ 11,656|$ 17,766|$ 25,698|$ 24,298|$ 34,632|$ 47,535|\n|IRA|$ -|$ -|$ -|$ 12,538|$ 21,969|$ 32,191|$ 24,338|$ 28,476|$ 33,579|\n|Roth IRA|$ -|$ 6,015|$ 10,924|$ 14,289|$ 17,287|$ 22,248|$ 25,526|$ 40,675|$ 57,652|\n|Brokerage|$ -|$ -|$ -|$ -|$ 29,868|$ 53,980|$ 53,498|$ 77,952|$ 107,875|\n|Total Assets|$ 2,576|$ 41,096|$ 79,854|$ 153,609|$ 244,719|$ 356,877|$ 350,154|$ 493,376|$ 652,115|\n|||||||||||\n|**DEBTS**|**12/31/2016**|**12/31/2017**|**12/31/2018**|**12/31/2019**|**12/31/2020**|**12/31/2021**|**12/31/2022**|**12/31/2023**|**12/31/2024**|\n|Student Loans|$ 22,885|$ 21,639|$ 19,936|$ 17,182|$ 13,454|$ 10,334|$ 7,084|$ 3,393|$ -|\n|Total Debt|$ 22,885|$ 21,639|$ 19,936|$ 17,182|$ 13,454|$ 10,334|$ 7,084|$ 3,393|$ -|\n|||||||||||\n|**Net Worth**|**12/31/2016**|**12/31/2017**|**12/31/2018**|**12/31/2019**|**12/31/2020**|**12/31/2021**|**12/31/2022**|**12/31/2023**|**12/31/2024**|\n||$ (20,309)|$ 19,457|$ 59,918|$ 136,428|$ 231,265|$ 346,543|$ 343,070|$ 489,983|$ 652,115|\n|YoY Change||$ 39,766|$ 40,461|$ 76,510|$ 94,838|$ 115,278|$ (3,473)|$ 146,913|$ 162,132|\n\n**FAQs:** Did you live at home? In community college, yes. After that, no. After moving to DC I split a 2br/1ba apartment with a co-worker to save $$$. A few years later my then-fiancée and I moved into a 1br apartment together.\n \nDid you parents support you financially? Yes. I was given a car (98-02 accord) in HS which I kept until 2020. I went to community college and lived at home. My parents also paid for my first year of rent when I moved away for a cheap in-state college. However, after graduating (with $23k in student loans), the only ongoing financial support I received was staying on the family phone and Netflix plan for several years. I would have lived at home if I could, but a several-hundred-mile commute would have been a bit much.\n \nDid you get lucky gambling in crypto, meme stocks, etc? No. I only do index funds (ex: VTSAX).\n \nHow did your traditional IRA go from $0 in 2018 to $12,538 in 2019? The IRS allows IRA contributions for the PY until approximately April 15th. For 2016 through 2018 I was always a year behind on contributions. By 2019 my salary had grown enough to catch up so I made 2 years of contributions (2018 and 2019) in 2019.\n \nYou don’t have kids, do you? Nope, not yet.",

      "text": "Insurance defense paralegal here; I get to do a lot of investigating that I enjoy. Recent case is a guy who fell getting out of his truck - nothing slippery, so I'm not sure how we're liable, but he fell on his back and fractured a vertebrae. \n\nSuit alleges lost wages, loss of ability to earn, etc. One of his \"main\" damages alleged is the fact that he (purportedly) gained a lot of weight while recovering due to his inability to work out and had to get rid of his cosplay costumes, some that were custom-made and expensive. But all together, his medical bills - without write offs, adjustments, insurance or PIP payments, just boardables - totaled about $50K. We have no proof of income let alone lost wages, so when we went to mediation last month, so we made what I thought was a very reasonable opening offer at mediation of more than that. \n\nAlso, as icky as it made me feel, we did a chart of Plaintiff's weight over the past 15 years, basically proving he gained a ton of weight during the pandemic and as of the time of his most recent doctor appointment earlier this year, he was only 8 pounds heavier than he was in the DOL. (At his deposition, he was only 10 pounds heavier, so this rebuttal to his claim shouldn't have been surprising.) So basically, we didn't include \"loss of costumes\" (that he never gave receipts for) in our damage assessment. \n\nMediation didn't even last an hour. Plaintiff and his attorney won't come off their 7-digit demand. (Yes, they want over a million dollars for this fall.) So I guess we're going to trial. \n\nHere's where the fun part (for me) comes in - I figured if he has all these cosplay costumes (most having to do with a galaxy far, far away) and given that we live in a state known for a certain mouse, I went on hunch he might be a pass holder and sent Disney a subpoena. \n\nWell, they delivered - not only providing every time Plaintiff went to any of their parks, and that he never once rented a wheelchair or requested accommodations, but also tons of photos! Including photos of Plaintiff on ALL the roller coasters and rides! Any time he went on something and didn't buy the photo at the end of the ride? Those were apparently all kept and provided to me today, dozens and dozens, all in glorious HD that will be fantastic to blow-up as a trial exhibit for a jury to see. \n\nImagine needing a million dollars for your \"crippling\" back pain, but well enough to go to theme parks and ride roller coasters! 🎢 ",

      "text": "1. It’s mostly meetings, audits, report writing/reading, and then more meetings. Yes, there is a large technical component, but it’s often overshadowed by paper pushing. This isn’t just true for blue teams - it applies to red teams too. One pentest report could have 12–15 pages dedicated to one IDOR vulnerability.\n2. Cybersecurity degrees are almost never worth it. College is great, and it’s even better when you’re studying a tried and true degree like Computer Science, which will always offer value well into the future. Howevr, cybersecurity is not an entry level field, and very few people actually graduate and move directly into a JR Sec Analyst/SOC role. It just doesn’t happen. You’re better off doing a 2 year IT program that covers computer science fundamentals/programming from an accredited school, or a 4 year CS degree from a traditional university. If neither of those are an option due to cost or flexibility, then go for certificates from known and reputable vendors - not some random LinkedIn Learning module nobody has heard of..\n3. You’re going to need knowledge across several domains: networking, programming, OS architecture (deep familiarity with Windows, Linux, and macOS internals.. especially command line, file systems, permissions, processes, and memory), incident response, risk management, threat analysis, and much more. Most importantly, soft skills. You will not get hired if people don’t want to work with you.\n\nI just wanted to list these as I feel they are most pertinent to finding a job in cyber security. I work as a Cybersecurity Analyst and have 7 years in IT, and it's PARAMOUNT that you understand the above IMO.\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Burnt out PGY1 here. Need to rant.\n\nMy husband works in tech on Wall Street. Makes $350k including stocks. 5 YOE. He works strictly 9-6 M-F. All weekends and holidays off. 20 days PTO. Free unlimited office food, free parking, free EV charging, free equinox membership. He got $10000 joining and relocation bonus. He gets to WFH whenever he feels too lazy to leave the house. He can call out sick at 8.55 am and doesn’t have to worry about coverage and what his manager/colleagues will think of him. He gets yearly appraisals, these don’t have any upper limit so if you’re a top performer in the company you can easily cross $1 million salary \n\nThe perks my husband enjoys is standard in the tech industry. He’s had jobs like this since he graduated from his 4 year undergrad. He graduated with an average GPA and had only 1 tech focused internship so it’s not like he was the top 0.1% of his class to be able to get jobs like this.\n\nAnd here I am slaving away in residency, working 80 hour weeks for &lt;$12/hr. I’ve been grinding for this since I was 18, went to one of the top med schools in my country, now I’m nearly 30 and I don’t even have 1/50th of my husband’s net worth. I’m in IM so the only job I can think of that comes close to my husband’s WLB is being a PCP, for half his salary alas. If I want to make as much money as him as a pcp I would need to move to rural middle of nowhere. PD and seniors are unsupportive and passive aggressive, no matter how hard we work we can never catch a break. We don’t get free cafeteria food and have to pay $200/month for parking.\n\nI hate my life. I wish I could go back in time and do engineering instead of med school. Rant over",

      "text": "I was laid off back in Feb. Spent not even a year with my last employer before I got the dreaded Teams meeting with my boss and HR. Got RIF'd, a measly severance, and escorted out of the building by front desk security. In this economy, might as well be a death sentence.\n\nI feel for you guys who are looking in the current job market, it's hell. They're paying pennies on the dollar, it's all onsite with little to no remote work, mostly contracts. I remember I was almost willing to take a Tier 2 Desktop Analyst position for 25hr cuz I was desperate. I had to burn through my savings, unemployment is a joke. I lost my relationship of three years because of the layoff, (my ex would say otherwise but we mostly argued over finances), couldn't afford repairs for my car, and my cat required surgery ($4000). To add insult to injury, the ex moved out, wanted half of her deposit back and now I had to pay for everything in full for almost half a year. Dude, I was going through it.\n\nAfter 7 months, 24 interviews, hundreds of emails, and thousands of applications, I got the job I was aiming for. IT support for the city public transportation department, and the commute is 12 min. $70k a year, direct to hire, full benefits. I can't tell you how much relief I feel, it's like I got my life back. I owe it in part to this sub, all the tips and questions answered helped me build a decent resume and improve my interview skills.

One day I might be setting up a physical server, another day I'm handling hosting issues, and the next, I'm knee-deep in Active Directory.\n\nThe only problem was that I worked at a food company, and there weren't any IT professionals I could learn from. But good news! Last week, I received  a job offer from a company that specializes in IT, with a higher salary. I'll be starting in a few weeks.\n\nThe best part is that I'll be working with professionals in a company whose core business is IT.  So, it feels like a great step forward for my IT career. The only catch is that it's a shift-based role, meaning I'll sometimes work weekends or even all night. But I think it'll be worth it.\n\nWhat do you all think? Am I on the right track?",

A generous 4 hours before. Add 20+ emails of cryptic instructions like, “Add that doc, no wait — remove it. But also keep it. And format it like I didn’t tell you.” She CC’d the office manager and another secretary to “help” but both were too hesitant because the emails were too confusing.\n\nI somehow managed to finalize everything 30 minutes before the deadline.

I kindly asked to be given materials earlier next time. You know, basic expectations and consideration of my time and anyone else in the office that would be forced to help.\n\nFour days later, I get this response:\n“There was no way I could’ve gotten these to you earlier. The clients and I did the hard part. All you had to do was format and compile. That’s the easy part. Did you even ask for help? The 5pm deadline wasn’t met, which leads me to believe you didn’t ask for help.”\n\nJust formatting and compiling…Like it’s a five-minute arts &amp; crafts project where I cut, copy, and paste.

      "text": "I don't know if the older guys have noticed like I have is that new technicians coming into the field are nothing like technicians from 20 years ago.  I'm not saying all of them, but there is a good chunk that are just soft.\n\nI interviewed a guy today, but this happens every couple interviews, that just graduated from school and are asking for $40 an hour because \"I put in my time at school\" and he actually believes he's worth it.  He's 19 and I told him the schedule and he said he doesn't do on call, overtime, or weekends because it causes him anxiety and when he starts getting stressed, his generational anxiety could land him in the hospital.  Like what the actual fuck is happening??\n\nIf I told my boss that 30 years ago, he would slap the shit out of me and tell me to knock it off.  I looked at him and asked if he was serious and he told me yes.  Then I asked him what would benefit me hiring him if he's on the edge of a breakdown if I make him work an hour overtime?  He said I would get the best technician in his class and I laughed at him and said the best technician in your class was standing in front of the class teaching.  \n\nI probably shouldn't have called him a cream puff because I'm sure he's going to run to his therapist and sue me, but fuck.  What the hell is happening.  Is anyone else seeing this?\n\n\nEDIT:\n\nI think there's a little confusion about the point I was trying to make.  I just posted what the guy said during the interview.  Somehow people read it as I'm an asshole to my guys and demand they work overtime, weekends, and rotation.\n\nThat's not how my company works.  I realized a long time ago that treating my guys with respect and paying them well creates a job they look forward to coming too.  My guys are like my family and the first 3 guys I hired in 2010, still work for me.\n\nI just thought this kid was a little demanding with the $40 an hour.  BUT, I do pay new guys right out of school $25 to $30 an hour and I pay my regular guys $50 to $70 an hour.\n\nIt makes zero sense to run a company where people hate coming to work.  Did I bust my ass before I opened my company, yes I did.  So do I require my technicians to kill their body for a paycheck?  No.  First thing I bought when I opened my company was a crane.  Not for huge lifts, but for package units and compressors.  Then I sent my guys to school to learn how to use it.\n\nMy company is what it is because of my employees, not because of me.  I want my guys to want to come to work, not stress them out so much they want to quit.  That would defeat they purpose of having employees if the all quit ",

At this site I work at, we have 3 air handlers. 1 with a hydronic coil, and 2 ahu with no hydronic coils, they use the coils in the VAV/FPB to heat the spaces. That’s how the building was designed. I was myself and wanted to try and cool off the 1st foor, and with it being 30 some degrees outside, I would open the economizer on the 1st floor AHU. I set automation to open the OAD (outdoor air damper) but the actuator wasn’t moving. So I manually opened the damper to allow cool air to come through. Over the weekend, the temperatures fell below freezing and Monday there was 2 hydronic reheat coils that burst on the VAVs. Bathrooms, classrooms on the first and lower level got drenched. I was informed the next day by my coworkers about the situation. I did some digging and realized it was my mistake. I told my two bosses and they weren’t heavily concerned but told me that I’m only doing PMs from now on. Tho my lead HVAC tech informed me that my direct boss was throwing me under the bus to the contractors that were fixing the units. Both the boss and contractors shit talking about me. \n\nI feel awful, if I get fired it’s understandable but if I get written up, I just have to keep my head down and realign myself. \n\nIn the end we all make mistakes, some big, some small but overall it’s about how you deal with it afterwords.

      "title": "Asked To Leave A Job As A Foreman",
      "text": "So, this is one of my favorite stories where I was politely asked to leave a job I was running. \n\nI was down to my third strike in about 2002 or so. I didn't want the first two because they were about 2 hours from my house and I was doing fine money wise. The call came in and it was with a contractor with a horrible name in the local, but I took it anyway, since it was my third strike, etc. I show up on the warehouse &amp; office space job and the first thing I notice is everything is piped in 1/2\"! I asked the foreman why and it turns out the first foreman quit and this guy was a residential upgrade that was still in the upgrade classes. He begged me to take the job over, but I said hell no. A few days later, the owner and PM show up and tell me they'll give me a truck and foreman's pay (10%), if I take the job over, so I did. \n\nWe finished that job and I go to the next one, which is a dental sales office. We had to saw cut and run everything under the slab to hook up chairs and all the stuff you see in a dentists office. I asked for a scope of work and the owner tells me to quit whining and just go off the print. No problem, dickhead. \n\nAfter about two weeks, the owner shows up and wants to know why it's taking so long. We argue a bit and he finally has someone bring out the scope. It's too much to list, but for example, the estimator had bid 26 receptacles and there were actually about 170. The owner and estimator come out and the kid estimator says, what's the big deal? It only takes a few minutes to install a recep and they're only a few bucks each. I asked him if he forgot all the conduit, wire, labor to get that recep ready to install? \n\nWe finished that job and lost quite a bit of cash on that one. So, off I go to the next one. It's an operating factory &amp; warehouse and we have to demo a ton of conduit, 1/2\" up to 4\", all loaded with wire. I split the wire with the building guy and me and my crew got about 10k out of it. Then we have to run new stuff for new equipment they have coming in. I was able to save some of it, but not much. Again, I'm asking for the scope of work and some help. This goes on for about three weeks. I got help but no scope. The owner calls and asks how it's going. I said I have no idea how far along we are because I don't have a scope. It seems to be going pretty good, but if the same guy bid this job, we could be in trouble. Hell, he couldn't bid receptacles right, how's he gonna bid something like all this equipment? I, of course, was laughing about it. Made some comments like, where did he get his degree, from a box of cracker jacks? Maybe a county fair at the goldfish pond? Bubblegum machine? Things like that. \n\nTwo days later, the owner shows up with a shop rocket. Talks to me for a few minutes and said this guy was going to take over my job because they had something closer to home for me. I walked the dude around for about a half hour or so. We go back to the owner, guy hands me a check! I've got his van! I'm like, what the fuck, dude? How the hell am I supposed to get home and why all of a sudden? Turns out the estimator was his son. That's the why. \n\nAs far as getting home, dude hired a limo to bring me two hours home! I made him stop at the hall so I could sign the books first. But I still laugh my ass off thinking this dude sent me home in a limo!\n\nI guess the guy technically didn't lie to me, it was closer to home. \n\nJust thought you brothers and sisters might get a chuckle out of this.\n\nIn solidarity.",

And some of them I absolutely would not have remembered if they weren't written down.\n\nSo my advice to you is to buy a cheap little notebook, and maybe once a week during clinicals, write about your feelings. Not another dumb intensive care plan, just what you did and the thoughts you had. It is a personal safe space and no one is judging you. Sometimes when you have an interesting patient, you feel like you will remember them forever, but you often don't. You might graduate eighteen months from now, and you will have completely forgotten that day that you took extra time to talk to a hospice patient and did something extra to keep them comfortable. It might even be something that didn't seem very important at the time, but would be a fantastic example to give during an interview.\n\nBest of luck, my friends!",

I come from a rather poor background, so the salary and expected potential are extremely significant and life-changing for me.\n\nDuring college and my internships, I was really excited about this industry. But after graduating, I took an extended break to backpack around the world for several months, and it was a truly eye-opening experience. Now, I feel like I no longer belong in this environment. The egos, the luxurious lifestyles, and everything I see among my colleagues no longer excite me.\n\nI have always been a simple person : I don’t care about fancy hotels or high-end restaurants. My only priorities are taking care of my family and achieving financial freedom, which is the only reason I’m staying in this industry.\n\nHave you ever doubted the meaning of all this hustle? How did you find purpose again after such an experience? How do you stay hungry when you lose your sense of purpose?",

      "text": "EDIT: Thank you so much for all your encouragement and the award! I’m proud to have been a part of this community. We’re stronger than we believe! If reading this truly struck you and you’re ready for an out, I hope you consider a change. Life is too short to be in a career you don’t like. It’s hard to leave what you know, but I truly believe it’s worse to be complacent with unhappiness long term. For me, college will only be another three to four years. The time will pass regardless. \nFor anyone reading this who found their heart here in nursing, I want to thank you again. You’re truly inspiring and the reason someone like me is living today. It’s cliche and we’ve all heard it a million times but I’ll say it once more. You save lives (yes, even by wiping by butts). Thank you. &lt;3\n\nWhen I became a registered nurse, I had already caught a glimpse of the less than idyllic reality that the healthcare system is.\nNursing school had a wonderful way of slowly feeding it to us over the semesters. \n\nAt the very start our professors told us heartwarming stories of all the nurses making differences in the lives of their patients. There was the brief reminder to “remember you’re not in this for the money”. \nBut of course not. At least not for me! No, I was going to save lives and make a difference in the world. \n\nNursing school was ruthless. We rolled up our pants so our clinical instructors could make sure our socks were white. All exam question choices were correct, but only one was the most correct. Below a 75 was considered a failing grade. Any absence in class was a huge deal. \nNeedless to say, there was a constant anxiety that permeated the classroom. We joked about throwing ourselves off the roof of the nursing building. \n\nOn my worst nights, deep in study and unable to take time to process what I witnessed in clinical that day, I contemplated why I didn’t.\n\nEach semester, we were exposed to the real world a little more. One day at clinical, an instructor told me to always lie and say we were married with three kids when a patient asked if we were single. I was naive. It sounded silly at the time. Why would they ask that? \nSoon enough, I had to tell a patient I was married with three kids.\n\nAt the end of nursing school, we had an entire class that focused on how litigious patients can be. As they should be. After all, nurses should never make mistakes. \nAnd anything that patients do to hurt us? We’re taught to report it. Yet somehow it’s still our fault. \n\nWhen I graduated and started my career in the ER, I was still determined to make a difference. Nursing school was worse, I reasoned.\n\nOn my best shifts I saved lives.\nMost shifts patients left with little answers. Or they were transferred to a floor with even worse coverage for care. Or they died. No matter what, I strived to make it a priority to be a shoulder to lean on. I held my patients hands. I’d always bring two warm blankets instead of one. I always tried to think of the little things. If I had three critical patients I still tried my best not to forget the turkey sandwich the least critical patient wanted. I did my best to think of everyone as a family member. I knew it hurt to do it that way, but the alternative was to see them as a job and ultimately, less as people. \n\nFor every good experience I had, I experienced several more terrible things. \nI once helped roll a body to do postmortem care and had their blood cover my shoes. As a matter of fact, I’ve been covered in all sorts of body fluids. I have been clawed at, spat on. I’ve had things thrown at me. I’ve been groped. I’ve had a patient threaten to kill me. I’ve cried in a supply closet. I’ve had nightmares. And I’ve hallucinated the constant beeping of monitors in my sleep.  \n\nPlease keep in mind, others have endured much worse. \n\nIt wasn’t long before I started crying before going to work. My heart was giving out. I became a patient myself when I went into SVT for the first time. I had to leave, or my body would make the choice for me.  \n\nSo I tried elsewhere. I worked at urgent care, family care, and finally a private practice. But for everything I left behind, new problems arose.  \n\nI was pressured to work while sick, told I was expected to use my lunch break to continue visits. It didn’t matter that most offices are closed for lunch too. \nGod forbid I ask a year in advance to take leave for my honeymoon. (The answer was “It’s unacceptable to assume you’ll have the time to do so”.)  Oh, and some nurses are bullies. \n\nThen I heard another former coworker took her life. \n\nI had enough. I quit my last nursing job.\n\nWhat I learned is no matter where you go, nurses are undervalued, underpaid (especially in the south USA), and treated as disposable by administration. \n“What about travel nursing?” Of course, there’s always more money to be made—if you want to sacrifice even more of your time, energy, and well-being for an even more stressful position in an unfamiliar environment experiencing a staffing shortage. \n\nNurses are expected to give everything while receiving little in return. We’re given cold pizza and certificates for a job well done instead of livable wages. \nWe’re taken advantage of for the very thing that brought most of us to the profession in the first place: caring.\n\nNursing will always have a place in my heart. I earned my BSN. I earned my RN. I worked damn hard for those letters and what they stand for. I’m proud of the people I have helped, and I will never forget the people I have lost. \n\nI have nothing but respect for fellow nurses who endure in a field that constantly beats them down. There will always be a need for nurses, and for those who thrive despite everything, I applaud you. Thank you for your strength. Thank you for doing what I could not. \n\nI’m studying to be an aerospace engineer now. I plan to use my BSN in conjunction with a BSAE to further advance safety in human space flight. \nI’m only a few semesters in and I’m still amazed at the difference. It’s hard, yes, but I don’t have to roll up my pants to show them I’m wearing space socks.\n\nMost notably, I don’t see articles every week about engineers being beat to near death while the industry brushes it aside.\n\nThank you.\n\nA Former RN",

      "text": "This is my first ever post on Reddit. Today, I had a patient who was truly awful and one of the worst encounters I’ve ever had and I just need to feel I’m not alone in these experiences! \n\n(For reference, I’ve been working in a dermatology clinic independently as the sole provider for 3 years now and for a total of 7 years:)\n\nI walk into the room and introduce myself. Immediately I could tell she was going to be awful by the way she sneered and looked me up and down. She told me in a very matter of fact way that she’d had granuloma annulare before, years ago, and it was back. She then proceeded to demand I treat it with “naprosyn” because she read about it online. “Naproxen?” I say. And she leans forward and it the most condescending manner says “No, not naproxen, Narcan. Do you know what Narcan is? “I asked do you mean nalaxone?”  “Yesss naloxone” she says, exasperated like somehow I’m an idiot when she was saying the wrong medication! I let her know very politely I wasn’t aware it could be used to treat this condition but I would certainly research it. She got agitated saying “ OH the research is there.” So I tell her more about the nature of the rash and then she proceeds to insist that it was caused by trauma she had to her lower leg or a vaccine. I just nodded and said the cause of this rash is unknown, and she got more agitated that I wouldn’t agree it was caused by her fall or a vaccine. I just said I’m sorry I can’t speak on what may of caused it in your case, it’s associated with x, y, z, etc. She goes back to asking about systemic drugs for it, I tell her none are approved, I typically treat with topicals and light box, she wasn’t having it. So I said well if you’re insistent on systemic therapy I need to do a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. \nAfter the biopsy and I go through the follow up timeline etc , she asks “and who does the skin checks here” - “I do mam, you can schedule an appointment on the way out” she said “No, we can do it NOW” and then asked well “then where’s the doctor” I said there is no doctor on site, if you’re uncomfortable with that you’re welcome to pursue care elsewhere (and I WISH I had a dermatologist on site - but in my area this is few and far between) \n\nMy blood was boiling!! I never feel mad like this with patients. I calmly explained no, we had exceeded the allotted time for her visit, this was scheduled for a rash, she needed to reschedule OR if she wanted to wait, I told her I’d see her after I saw the remainder of my patients. She huffed and asking well how long will THAT be? \n\nI just don’t know why I chose a career where I have to put up with this type of behavior from people - to be disrespected and just have to grin and bear it. To be looked down upon because I’m not an M.D. (totally fine with me, I have utmost respect for M.D.s and don’t resent I’m not one or pretend to know everything they do) when they knew I was a PA when they scheduled the appointment ahead of time!! I could’ve pursued a different masters program that wouldn’t have this end result. \n\nIt was so degrading. She was so condescending, rude, mean. I’m over it. \n\nI want out of patient care. \n\nCan anyone else relate? \n#rantover \n\n\n\n",

      "text": "Previous Posts: [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1i7ndbl/bosses_are_about_to_learn_the_hard_way_what_some/) [Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ly99ml/update_bosses_are_about_to_learn_the_hard_way/)\n\nTLDR for previous parts: I worked at a nonprofit as head of a 2-man IT department with the other guy being strictly helpdesk with no desire for more responsibility. Management contracted a local MSP to \"help\" with cybersecurity and IT. From my perspective, we weren't getting anywhere close to the value of what we paid them per month, but the MSP was able to convince upper management to continue to spend more money. Not necessarily looking to leave, an opportunity arose and I put my notice in.\n\nMy notice period went by pretty quietly. I offboarded what I could to who I could, but there were several compliance related duties I did that required a dedicated, competent employee to take over. Bosses wanted the MSP to take these over, the MSP didn't want to take them over (don't blame them, it doesn't make sense for an MSP to do it), and in the end they delegated it to the helpdesk guy for a whopping $1 more an hour.\n\nThey also volun-told the helpdesk guy that he would be taking on more of my responsibilities, including a schedule change and being available for calls outside of his working hours. I feel bad for him as his financial situation doesn't give him much choice in declining these responsibilities. \n\nThe MSP wasted no time in convincing upper management to allocate my salary to more projects. The servers that aren't even 4 years old will be replaced with new servers for over twice the price of what was originally paid ($10k --&gt; $20k+). The remaining Cisco/Meraki equipment that isn't even 2 years old will be replaced with Unifi. They finally got the SonicWall firewall configured properly after 6 months, just in time for the SSLVPN vulnerability to be announced. \n\nI was never given a counteroffer to stay; I'd like to say I was surprised, but I wasn't. They did ask if they could contract services with me to offer assistance if the helpdesk guy or the MSP ran into something that wasn't documented or unique to the environment. I was open to it so long as they understood my new job took priority; both upper management and the MSP spoke about this with me. Eventually, they dropped the topic altogether so I don't know if there was an epiphany somewhere or what, but I'm not disappointed either way. \n\nI'm a few weeks into my new job. I love it. It's fully remote, I have a lot of autonomy, my boss is well-experienced, and I don't have to worry about being a jack-of-all-trades. I reached out to the helpdesk guy at my old job to ask how he was doing. He still hasn't gotten his $1 raise and is spoken to like a child much of his time. I feel for him. He'll either have to learn a lot quickly or find a new job. \n\nDespite everything I've written about my old job, I didn't hate it. I learned a lot and had a lot of freedom. My coworkers respected me, but I had grown as much as I was going to. Hiring an MSP was just the cherry on top of motivating me to leave. There won't be another update as I can't imagine anything else happening. Thanks to everyone who followed this so far and for all the support! To all the SMB sysadmins out there, never stop learning and beware the MSPs!",

      "title": "2 year client wants 40% of my commission",
      "text": "I am dealing with an incredibly annoying/dense client who is under contract, two weeks from closing my biggest deal. I have been working with this client for 2 years. He chose to work with me because I’m in his community and he heard good things about me (his words). \n\nWhen we started working together he kept reiterating that he was very relaxed who was fairly on top of the market and would only require showings if he couldn’t get to an open house. I was glad to hear it especially because his search is over an hour away from where I live but thought it was unnecessary as I was happy to show him homes as quickly as they were available to view.  \n\nEvery aspect of getting him to offer something reasonable was like pulling teeth, he argued with me about every little thing. I kept calm and explained to him that his offers were weak and he most likely wouldn’t be considered. He did not believe me but after the 14th failed offer he started to wonder if it was because we were POC, my brokerage, my age and gender. I put my foot down and I told him I would be more aggressive on my opinion since he was starting to blame me and my calm attitude was not getting through to him. Some people need to be yelled at or experience an alpha I guess… \n\n2 years in, 16 offers, over 50 showings with him and his poorly behaved children who I watched over like a babysitter because he and his wife couldn’t be bothered to keep an eye on them. The hours on hours I spent driving for these showings and with this client on the phone to give him my professional advice and opinion on price strategies, best terms to offer and explaining what highest and best meant over and over again was all finally is worth something because we are under contract. \n\nHe has switched loan officers 4 times to get the best offer. Completely wasted my preferred lender’s time for 7 months, luckily the lender knows his reputation for being a professional time waster. Harassed his lawyer and me nonstop during A/I in the late evenings and weekends for answers that we were simply waiting for response on. This guy lacks boundaries or awareness of how this all works but refuses to comprehend when taught. \n\nHe has a request for me now that we are finally out of A/I. He wants 40% of my commission. I audibly laughed on the phone when he asked. It was a reflex but I was shocked. He then went down to 13.5%. I told him I would give him a flat payment (I would typically give this to a client as a GIFT for way less due to the amount of time and effort I have put in) of .5% of my commission. He argued with me over this for quite some time and I’m disgusted. It’s insulting and I have never “given” my clients money back this way. He feels it’s fair to ask since he wasn’t “that much work” and he claims that his previous realtor gave him a similar amount. I wonder why he isn’t working with that guy if he gave him close to half of his commission. \n\nHe said he was giving me a chance as a new young realtor. I’ve been doing this for 4 years and this is one of 4 closings I have scheduled for the month of November. \n\nI’m inclined to offer .5% one last time and let him know it’s only as a courtesy. Take it or leave it but we aren’t arguing or talking about this again. \n\nI recognize that this is an important lesson for me and I have this client for a reason. It’s to make me a stronger realtor. I’m curious if any of you have had to navigate a situation like this and what you did.\n\nFor numbers, this is about $20k commission, after split and tax I’m looking at $13k take home ",

      "title": "How I scraped 4.1 million jobs with GPT4o-mini",
      "text": "**Background**: During my PhD in Data Science at Stanford, I got sick and tired of ghost jobs &amp; 3rd party offshore agencies on LinkedIn &amp; Indeed. So I wrote a script that fetches jobs from 100k+ company websites' career pages and uses GPT4o-mini to extract relevant information (ex salary, remote, etc.) from job descriptions. I made it publicly available here [https://hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe) and you can follow my progress and give me feedback at r/hiringcafe\n\n**Tech details (from a DS perspective)**\n\n1. Verifying legit companies. This I did manually, but it was crucial that I exclude any recruiting firms, 3rd party offshore agencies, etc. I manually sorted through the \\~100,000 company career pages (this took several weeks) and picked the ones that looked legit. At Stanford, we call this technique \"occular regression\" :) \n2. Removing ghost jobs. I discovered that a strong predictor of if a job is a ghost job is that if it keeps being reposted. I was able to identify reposting by doing a embedding text similarity search for jobs from the same company. If 2 job descriptions overlap too much, I only show the date posted for the *earliest* listing. This allowed me to weed out most ghost jobs simply by using a date filter (for example, excluding any jobs posted over a month ago). \n3. Scraping fresh jobs 3x/day. To ensure that my database is reflective of the company career page, I check each company career page 3x/day. To avoid rate-limits, I used a rotating proxy from Oxylabs for now.\n4. Building advanced NLP text filters. After playing with GPT4o-mini API, I realized I could can effectively dump raw job descriptions (in HTML) and ask it to give me back formatted information back in JSON (ex salary, yoe, etc). I used this technique to extract a variety of information, including technical keywords, job industry, required licenses &amp; security clearance, if the company sponsors visa, etc.\n\n**Question for the DS community:** Beyond job search, one thing I'm really excited about this 4.1 million job dataset is to be able to do a yearly or quarterly trend report. For instance, to look at what technical skills are growing in demand. What kinds of cool job trends analyses would you do if you had access to this data.\n\n**Edit:** A few folks DMed asking to explore the data for job searching. I put together a minimal frontend to make the scraped jobs searchable: [https://hiring.cafe](https://hiring.cafe) — note that it's currently non-commercial, unsupported, just a PhD side-project at the moment until I gradute.\n\n**Edit 2::** thank you for all the super positive comments. you can follow my progress on scraping more jobs on r/hiringcafe .Aalso to comments saying this is an ad, my full-time job is my phd, this is just a fun side project beofore I get an actual job haha",

      "text": "I’ve only shared this with close friends and family. In December of 2019, I failed out of my RN program at second semester. At my school, you had to have an 80 in the class and 80 on the final to pass.  I was borderline on OB, needing a 90 on the final to pass the class. I scored 80-something, failing the class. In my adult 1 final, I scored a 78. Despite having a low-90 overall in the class; I was dismissed from the program as I failed 2 courses. I appealed, wrote letters, had a meeting with the school Dean, all of which ended up a waste of time. On a side note, I learned the next semester they changed the policy to needing an 80 overall, no regards to the final. \n\n2020 came, I started applying to other programs. Despite having taken A&amp;P, I had to retake it as it had expired at being 6 years old. Covid hit, and on came the challenges with that. I completed a&amp;p with a B. \n\nI enrolled in a semi-accelerated program, while still struggling with OB, passed my exams, (this program requires a 78% exam and class average to pass) I graduated spring of 2022 and took my NCLEX about a month later, passing first try. I’m now 2.5 years as an RN with plans to further my education. \n\nIf you’re struggling or even get dismissed like I did, don’t give up. Not all programs are created equal and some are just a better fit. \n\nTake some time and think about your future plans and what you intend to do. If you want to be a nurse, check out other programs. Know that failing isn’t always your fault, some schools care more about having a high NCLEX pass % than actually helping students succeed. \n\nEdit-I later learned that schools who advertise 100% pass rate for X semesters fail to mention that over half the class dropped or failed out. \n",

      "text": "Before I make my point, I want to point out...\n\n1. I worked before in fast food, trucking, retail and substitute teaching for many years respectively\n2. I'm in my 6th year as a classroom teacher\n3. I acknowledge all teaching jobs aren't created equal, esp. throughout USA. Some areas pay close to minimum wage while forcing 3rd-world working conditions while other areas pay over six figures. I work in a blue state with decent pay and benefits so this is just from my perspective, so obviously this may not apply for everybody. \n\nYes, the job may be stressful at times. \n\n* It's mentally draining having to multitask and do the work of 5-10 people while teaching, having to print/make copies, grade papers, monitor students, model lessons and answer phone calls from the office all at the same time without the benefit of being able to clone yourself in TEN. \n* I dislike the fact that I \\[can potentially\\] get blamed for EVERYTHING that happens (i.e. student noncompliance, poor work ethic, questionable parenting, etc.) \n* I dislike the fear and nervousness of unannounced classroom observations and my value being determined by \"numbers\"\n* I have a hard time working for delusional admins who expect miracles to be performed and expectations being unclear and always shifted and changed last-minute\n\nBut everytime I'm having a \"terrible\" day I always look back and stay grateful for what I DO have. \n\n* I work 6 hours a day (5 actually teaching) and &lt;190 days a year compared to most jobs (8+ hours a day, \\~250 days a year). \n* I DO spend most of my day active and under stress but I'm so preoccupied with my delivery, performance and meeting deadlines that I rarely if ever, have time to look at the clock. I'd a million times rather be preoccupied than be standing in a spot or a room for 8+ hours where ONE workday feels like an ETERNITY like most other jobs do. \n* My hard work is ACTUALLY benefitting society...CHILDREN. Kids who are mostly starved of love, guidance and affection (figuratively speaking of course) and look up to me as a role model and important figure in life. Unlike most jobs where their hard work is going to make some greedy billionaire richer so he can buy his 15th yacht. \n* My job is secure and \\[almost\\] guaranteed, especially after tenure. I am salaried and my income is stable. I don't have to worry about a cheap greedy manager/owner slashing my hours or benefits for their own personal gain. I don't have to work 2+ jobs to put food on the table or a roof over my head.\n* I have a decent union that makes sure my job abides by labor laws. Our time is respected. Apart from lesson planning and miscellaneous paperwork, nobody takes advantage of us or makes us work a minute later compared to many jobs who break laws and blackmail their employees so more work can get done for less pay. \n* Decent Pension, 401k and Roth IRA options. Many jobs offer none of these and who knows if SS will even exist in the future?\n* No manual labor. My job is arduous at times but when you relatively compare yourself to tens/hundreds of millions of people around the world baking in the 100-degree sun 12 hours a day, 6-7 days a week while getting paid PENNIES, I'm grateful to have what I have. \n* Personal time consumed for Lesson Planing and paperwork varies by job and location, but that time is OPTIONAL and FLEXIBLE. You can plan in your lunch period, before work or the afternoon from your house. Also as the years go by and you gain experience, the time you spend lesson planning gradually diminishes\n\n  \nDo I wish teachers were respected more and things changed for the better? Yes. \n\nDo I wish my pay was higher? Yes. \n\nTeaching may not be the easiest or highest-paying job in the world, but despite all the negatives, there's alot of positives and overall I'm grateful to be where I am today. How do you guys feel?",

During the COVID-19 pandemic, I was a sysadmin and fell into an Azure rabbit hole. Living alone during the stay-at-home orders, I initially devoted 2-3 hours of professional development after work, but my ADHD hyper-focus turned it into 8-10 hours, not including workday hours.\n\nI stormed through my expert 365 admin cert and developed extensive Azure GCC experience. I discovered that the suites loved shiny dashboards and learned to survive on 4 hours of sleep, embracing a dangerous mindset I called “total commitment.” Two months later, I was rocking and abusing my Power BI certification.  \n\nI quadrupled my salary in two years, earning an exceptional salary band even by D.C. standards. However, I ignored warning signs like surging blood pressure, massive hair loss, and fatigue, thinking I needed more discipline. I started sleeping only every other day.\n\nLast year, I completed an ERP project a month early and received an outstanding bonus, professional clout rose. The next day, I randomly fell unconscious for three hours and was hospitalized for a week. I lied at work, said I had a home emergency, and worked everyday from the hospital from my phone, drs advice be damned.\n\nToday, I finished a successful week integrating systems and closing projects early, it only took 80 hours this week. No biggie. My friend invited me to dinner tonight, and to my surprise,my parents (who live 5 hours away), my boss (who secretly logged my work hours), and friends I hadn’t seen in years were there.\n\nThe end result was a very painful conversation, I am on a mandatory leave of absence for three months, and a father who admitted he already prepared his heart to bury his son early.

I don't care to draw attention to my own personal situation but want to provide some background which will hopefully establish some bonafides.\n\nI got started in IT services doing End-User/Small Business PC diagnosis and repair. I spent approx. 15 years doing various degrees of the IT career ladder (Service Desk, SysAdmin, Network Admin, Systems Engineer, etc.) before finding out how exhausting and soul sucking that was. Having been so tired, I asked around to see what I might be able to take my experience and use it for besides what I was already doing.\n\nThe topic of using the skills in cybersecurity was one that came up quite a bit, being recommended to roles in SecOps. This was in roughly 2020/2021. I took the advice and found a place that let me engage in ransomware remediation (more than I had been doing at my level). I was able to keep that one on my resume for a couple years as I was contracting for them on an as needed basis. The work was AWESOME. I operated as the lead for a MSSP startup that was dealing in mostly reactive manners to ongoing ransomware cases. I got to spend 8-14 hours a day digging into how TA's TTP (Threat Tactic Procedures) changes as the event is happening. Working against some of the largest players at the time in the space (BlackBasta, Conti, Lockbit, etc.)\n\nAfter doing that role for a couple of years, I eventually moved into a more consultant based role where I got to be a bit more proactive (with a healthy bit of reactive mixed in). I got to engage in audits based off of the NIST CSF 2.0 Framework and got to remediate the actions items I found during the audits. I thought that this would surely help me round out my security resume and that if I ever ended up back in the job market I would be better off for it.\n\nTo be fair, I wasn't counting on not having a job at any point (then again, who is?) I was fully committed to this company, when one of their customers got hit w/ ransomware because of a decision one of the previous owners had made in creating local accounts on their exploitable firewall that were eventually found and used - I was the one that spent 80 hours over 7 days in that customers office getting things back up (despite the ESXi host being completely encrypted along with the datastores).\n\nBut alas, bad things tend to come quarterly when your industry is considered a cost-center for most companies. After taking vacation in Nov '24 out of the country, I came back and was told \"We don't have enough work to sustain your bosses salary AND yours, so we are laying you off effective immediately. I was as cordial as possible, returned my equipment, and asked for severance since this was a layoff and not a termination. \"We have never done that in the past, so we won't be doing it now.\"\n\nObviously, as someone who likes the work I do I immediately shifted gears, tried to find as many companies as I could to apply to with the experience I have. Trying to use the 80-90% required experience rule (if you meet 80-90% apply anyway) that I was always taught growing up and on my way into this field. But it really seems to have gone absolutely nowhere.\n\nIt's been 10 months now and I am still looking, very actively at that. I spend hours a day on LinkedIn looking for companies (which is how I found the last 4 roles I had prior to this) to apply to. Even ditching the 80-90% rule in favor for a 100% one. I do OSINT on companies and try to connect and DM hiring managers/recruiters/other employees. Again, adding more time to the already miserable process. I was forced to apply for unemployment, which at this stage has come and went - leaving me with absolutely nothing to bring in income (which I can only imagine based on what I see on LI that several others with similar skills and experience are going through the same).\n\nBut when you look at the people that are specifically in charge of that first level of contact? The recruiters? They are too busy making posts on LI about how they \"can't be humanly expected to view every candidate that submits an application.\" Even better is the \"Just let AI handle it, it'll tell you which ones are the good ones worth reaching out to\" people. Because from what I can see, the ATS doesn't like your resume formatting? Low rank. Doesn't understand the similarities between keywords in your resume/profile and the job description? Low rank. What happens when that does finally get to the recruiters eyes? They call the first 20 in their \"top ranking\" list and schedule them interviews. Everyone else gets a crappily worded message (if they are lucky) about how the company loves that they put their time in but aren't going to even do them the kindness of talking to them before assuming they don't have what they are looking for.\n\nThe hardest part? Now there's all these services that will submit your app for you autonomously, inputting in your data/etc and matching you to whatever keywords you tell it to apply for and basically every AI will write you a resume if you tell it to. So what is really going on? AI is reading the resumes that AI is writing? Nobody is getting work?\n\nThere's people with double my time in the field saying they are seeing the same problem. They aren't getting work either. They get completely ignored when 2-3 years ago they were called early into the process and typically saw all of the processes through to the end.\n\nSO back to the point - what the actual heck is going on? (I'd love to be more animated here)  \nHow many times should you edit your LI profile, your resume, your email header, etc. before everyone stops for a second and recognizes something is wrong. Companies like ISC2 ignoring/not validating 5-year requirements and letting SD people that did PW resets in AD for 5 years pass the mark for their minimum requirements, yet somehow are the expected industry norm now?\n\nHonestly, as much as the work makes me feel like a used towel, I'd rather go back to systems engineering making half the money just to avoid these companies that really feel like walking on eggshells. Which makes me super sad, when I talk to others in the industry they say they love the work too. That it brings them enjoyment or at the least fulfillment. But not working for 10 months? No interviews in the last 3? I just don't know anymore if it feels like the place I can keep trying to stay in when there really doesn't feel like much of a foundation to stand in.\n\nTL;DR Cybersecurity job market in the USA feels very shifty, on constantly unsettling sands. Doesn't matter if you have or don't have experience, people all across the sector are saying it feels impossible to get hired or to even get the time of day from recruiters. It feels like something is broken and wrong, and not sure how else to pinpoint the issue other than it feels like a market created by HR/recruiters who don't actually have any knowledge of what we do but disqualify us based on what their ATS tells them (even if frequently wrong).\n\nEDIT: Before anyone else comments here with the same rough advice let me be clear and save you some time. I already reach out to friends/past co-workers extensively when able. No, I do not have a bad relationship with anyone of my recruiters or past co workers just because I respond negatively to your cookie cutter advice. Yes, I do cater my resume to each job I apply to and have done so for at least six out of the ten months I have been in the market. Yes, my experience goes extensively beyond what is listed in the post because I was trying not to bore everyone with my life's story. If you're that interested, look at the comments and I am sure you can put together some of my experience. No, I have not ever had an issue like this in the past 20 years worth of networking and applying to jobs (short of a 5 month window in 2020 after my contract ended for lack of physical work) or in trying to set up business with customers/clients. Lastly, yes I REALLY have been doing this since I was 12 - it's fine if you got to live a privileged upbringing but if I wanted to make enough to eat and have even the smallest amount of required items to go to school and live a decent childhood  I had to work for it early on. I don't care if \"you read that and immediately thought it was bullshit\" nor do I care if you caught one slip I made while writing the original post on TTP (Tactics, techniques, procedures) in the middle of the night. The reality of the amount of ransomware I have stopped, the amount of attacks I have reversed, the amount of companies that wouldn't have been running if not for my help, the amount of courts that have paid me to be an expert witness, frankly - it's enough proof for me. If it's not enough for you, rather than berate me and tell me I am in the wrong industry or that I \"need to edit my resume\" for the 1000th time, why not instead question others in your own network and ask them if they are going through something similar. Because I would go beyond a shadow of a doubt to say that they'd agree. Everyone I know, 3,5,10,20,25 years of experience is going through this. It's not a matter of us just suddenly forgetting how to make a decent resume or how to communicate with people. To even insinuate that is a fallacy built on your own misconception of the job market. Be it based on your own bias from experience or seeing others. Stop trying to give me unnecessary advice that I didn't ask for and getting upset that I am not reciprocating that.  Because things like \"Edit Resume, Message your network, surely you are just not doing it right\" not only are completely worthless, they're already being done and have been being done for YEARS. They just are not working now, and that is my whole point in this post. ",

      "text": "*tl;dr: Title,* [Diagram Here](https://imgur.com/a/5THOIEU)*. 5 YoE, no FAANGs. I have a B.S. in CS + Bio from Berkeley. Primarily Healthcare SWE experience. Job market is not that bad for Senior SWEs. TC &gt;$100k + Fully Remote. I'm a US Citizen.*\n\nI always see the doom and gloom from this sub regarding layoffs and the struggles of people finding a job and wanted to add a counter-story. I got laid off from my job on July 14th. It was an absolute gut punch and all of my worst fears came true. I saw all the posts from people with years of experience struggle with finding a job and thought I was absolutely screwed going into the market. Thankfully, either I have a really good skill set or people are being overly pessimistic (though it is most likely a combination of both.)\n\nI do think that there is still merit to the doom and gloom though. When looking for a job, there were barely any new grad, entry level, or junior level job postings. Most of the jobs that I saw started at senior and made their way up but it seems that the market for mid and senior level roles is still relatively healthy. Almost every position that I interviewed for was hybrid, with a good chunk being 5 days a week in person. A very small minority were fully remote.\n\nAs for how I went about that job search, the day I got laid off I got an invite to a \"Mandatory Meeting\" with my boss + some random person that I didn't know at exactly 9AM. I knew then it was over and immediately started polishing my resume and applying to every company that I could think of. I went directly to the career page and found jobs that I thought that I was qualified for. I may have applied to every company that I can think of, but I only applied to roles that matched my skillset. Every single job that I applied to was either directly on the company page or LinkedIn jobs sorted by last 24 hours.\n\nI did NOT use any AI - this includes auto-apply software or even tuning my resume. Everything was done by hand, manually by me. The only \"automation\" that I did was sign up for a [greenhouse.io](http://greenhouse.io) account so that my name, email, and other info was autofilled by them.\n\nThe first 48 hours was the hardest because it was just sending applications into the void without knowing if it would yield anything. Then starting Wednesday that same week, I started getting interview requests and stopped applying to new jobs. I did not ask my network for any references as I was not desperate yet.\n\nFor context, I am in the San Francisco Bay Area and work in the biotech industry (and if you're on r/biotech, biotech is equally screwed as tech, if not more.) The job I got is in the healthcare field but unrelated to the job I previously had. TC is a nice bump up from my previous position but I will not share it since people in real life know what my Reddit handle is (but I can say that it is more than $100,000 but less than $1,000,000.) I have 5 years of experience as a Software Engineer in various healthcare companies ranging from small startups to large companies with both a CS and biology degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nOf course, this is just one data point. YMMV\n\nTo those still hunting, good luck.",

Just a small sampling of all the benefits of voting Republican. \n\nGuys, you have got to look into this Project 2025. I just looked at it and in 20 minutes I found:\n\n1) Get rid of OSHA, NLRB. Quote from 2025 \"End PLA requirements. Agencies should end all mandatory Project Labor Agreement requirements and base federal procurement decisions on the contractors that can deliver the best product at the lowest cost. l Repeal Davis–Bacon. Congress should enact the Davis–Bacon Repeal Act and allow markets to determine market wages.\"\n\n2) Get religious organizations involved in labor organizations I quote 2025 \"Encourage and enable religious organizations to participate in apprenticeship programs, etc. Both DOL and NLRB should facilitate religious organizations helping to strengthen working families via apprenticeship programs, worker organizations, vocational training, benefits networks, etc.\" They have that in Canada called CLAC, google it.\n\n3) Another one is get teenagers into high risk job training. I quote from 2025 \"Hazard-Order Regulations. Some young adults show an interest in inherently dangerous jobs. Current rules forbid many young people, even if their family is running the business, from working in such jobs. This results in worker shortages in dangerous fields and often discourages otherwise interested young workers from trying the more dangerous job. With parental consent and proper training, certain young adults should be allowed to learn and work in more dangerous occupations. This would give a green light to training programs and build skills in teenagers who may want to work in these fields. l DOL should amend its hazard-order regulations to permit teenage workers access to work in regulated jobs with proper training and parental consent.\" Of course they don't define the age group precisely. Like 13-19? 14-19? Hell why stop there, get them while they are young and start at 6.\n\n4) No OT on retirement or annuities. I quote 2025 \"Congress should clarify that the “regular rate” for overtime pay is based on the salary paid rather than all benefits provided. This would enable employers to offer additional benefits to employees without fear that those benefits would dramatically increase overtime pay.\" Of course this is why employers don't offer more benefits (sarcasm included).\n\n5) 40 hours will not define OT anymore. I quote 2025\" Congress should provide flexibility to employers and employees to calculate the overtime period over a longer number of weeks. Specifically, employers and employees should be able to set a two- or fourweek period over which to calculate overtime. This would give workers greater flexibility to work more hours in one week and fewer hours in the next and would not require the employer to pay them more for that same total number of hours of work during the entire period.\"\n\nLot more goodies in there for the working man/woman.

I would go onto r/StudentNurse and found so much good advice from others who walked the journey before myself and also from those who were going through similar challenges as I was. \n\nFor those who are anxious and nervous... you got this! Trust in yourself and truly take it one day at a time. I was in an accelerated program and the program felt extremely quick (especially when we took Pharmacology in 6 weeks...) \n\nJust some advice... \n\n1) Pay attention and active listening in class. Don't worry so much about taking notes. If you listen, you'll retain a lot more than you think. Just write down major key points. \n\n2) Don't focus so much on what works for others... focus on what works for you. No matter what advice someone gives you on how to study or what to study, you just need to find what works for you. \n\n3) Absolutely sit near the front of the classroom. There's less distractions in the front. This is coming from an introvert that used to hide in the way back of the classroom. My grades were a lot higher when I moved to the front (even the middle is fine!) \n\n4) Don't spend all of your time invested in school! If you're doing well, just take that break and go out with your friends. I noticed the more I was relaxed, the better I did on exams. One night, I decided to go out with friends the night before an exam and I surprisingly made a 94. \n\n5) Sleep early before test dates. It really helps... do NOT pull an all nighter... I did not pull any all nighters and I do not think I could. \n\n6) Take care of yourself :-) Try to find something that will help you relieve your stress. \n\n7) For clinicals... don't be nervous! You're new... you don't need to know everything! But also, stay in your lane. Don't be overly confident and try to do things on your own or question nurses about their knowledge (thats not your job). I knew a friend that had previous medical experience and she didn't leave good impressions with the nurses. She ALWAYS had issues with her clinical experiences, instructors, nurses and it made me realize it had more to do with her than the others. Always ask questions... always jump in when the opportunity comes. If they ask \"who wants to do a foley?\" you should say ME!!!! The best time to learn is when you're a beginner and you have people supporting you. \n\n8) Apply to jobs early. Don't spend so much time trying to perfect your resume like I did. I lost my chance to a lot of positions that got filled up quickly. \n\nI'll be leaving this Subreddit, but if anyone ever needs advice, feel free to message me at any time! :-) For those that are in school... you got this! There's a ton of resources online... you do NOT need to purchase those $100+ notecards or study aides!!\n\nGood luck everyone! ",

      "text": "Yeah, yeah, we’ve all heard it. There’s no money in general surgery, right? Funny, because I somehow made $700K this year while spending most of my life inside an OR and answering nonstop consults at 3 AM for things that definitely aren’t surgical.\n\nHow?\n\t•\tI learned how to bill properly. Turns out, saving someone’s life is actually worth more than a Taco Bell salary, who knew?\n\t•\tI own a surgery center. Because if the hospital is going to make millions off my work, I might as well get a cut.\n\t•\tI say yes to everything. Hernia? Sure. Gallbladder? No problem. Someone stubbed their toe but thinks it’s an emergency? Why not.\n\nI have partners who make over $1M, but they also haven’t seen their kids in years, consider sleeping four hours a “win,” and spend their vacations taking trauma call in a different state.  No, I do not need a “sign-on bonus” or a “stipend” I need RVU multipliers and a real buy-in, thank you very much.\n\nAnd let’s not forget profit sharing. Turns out, when you actually own a piece of the pie—whether it’s an SC, imaging center, or even a stake in the anesthesia group. You get a little extra on top of your base salary. While some docs cry about RVUs, I’m out here getting a cut every time someone orders a CT scan. \n\nOh, and before you cry about loans, I paid mine off in cash within two years. You can do it too, just say goodbye to sleep, happiness, and most of your relationships.\n\nFor any med students wondering if general surgery is worth it. Yes, if you like long hours, high stress, and being the person everyone calls when things go wrong.\n\nAnyway, gotta go, I just got consulted for an “acute abdomen” that’s really just constipation.",

      "text": "\n\nFirst, I fully acknowledge that I may have just gotten lucky through this process, but I also feel that I definitely put in a lot of work to progress my skills faster. \nLong story short, loyalty to a company is dead nowadays. \nI only have (coming up on) a year in the IT industry with just one cert(Sec+)and I have job hopped 3 times in that time. \nI started at $48k for my first job, help desk. After 5 months, I found another help desk job for $62k. Then, 3 months later, I found another role as  system administration role for $80k, then 3 months later, I just now accepted an offer for $100k in networking. \n\nThe things I PERSONALLY feel made made me excel were only small things that compounded. \nFirst, I would always ask what project to be put on that could be improved. Things like bench stock inventory, software documents, or any additional duty. Something that is big enough to show you really made a difference, but not so big you’re in over your head. This gave me something to do in my down time and made me always look busy. I’d always gone a very brief weekly update without being asked to show that I’m still working it, the progress I made, and what I had planned next week. This can show your skills like organization, initiative, and willingness to learn. \nSecond, cross training and finding single points of failure within the desk or job. Someone doesn’t have a secondary for an additional duty, help them out. Only one person knows how to do a specific job, ask to learn. This helps you meet and get to know your cowriters, learn the job better, and help the team. For me, this helped me bond with coworkers via work and not small talk because I’m an introvert and hate that. \nLastly, I took my time with applying to jobs. I applied to only 2-3 a week, but I tailored my resume to each one and made sure I met all or most requirements. Tailoring my resume started giving me about an 85% response rate vs just mass applying. I can’t stress how much this helps. \nThis wasn’t a bragging post, but just something I wanted to share to see if it helps something else and to let them know that it’s possible to speed run the salary ladder to decent pay. \n\nThere’s more I felt I did and I’d be happy to explain if you want more tips.

      "text": "Forever ago when I was a little PA-S, I had a fairly grueling trauma rotation. For six weeks we did five 12-14 hour shifts, on our feet the whole time (we ate while walking the hallways, without exaggeration), and once a week we spent the night and got no real sleep and did post call the next day (once my resident woke me up after 45 minutes of bliss-filled uncomfortable napping on the sad on call room bed - we went down to the trauma bay and it was an obviously non-surgical, drunk guy who hit his head. \"What'd you wake me up for?\" I asked the young doctor. \"Hey man, someone has to check rectal tone!\").\n\n  \nMy preceptor, a hardened trauma attending, was one bad SOB but man the guy must've got burned by somebody somewhere. After we did our 24 hour shift and rounded for post call he'd take me, another sad PA-S, and a couple residents to the conference room and lecture us on the worst stuff possible, like IL-6 and cytokine release. Man you're a board certified trauma surgeon, do you really need to teach this stuff? The room was always a cozy 72 degrees too while the rest of the hospital was always too hot or freezing cold. And if whoever was post call that day fell asleep while he lectured, he'd make an example out of them.\n\nWell all along as a PA-S and on my emergency medicine rotation, the ER docs always had this little spiel where they said, \"You know what separates us from ALL the other doctors?\" *You have no circadian rhythm either, I thought?* \"Other doctors think 'what's the most likely diagnosis.' We think 'what's most likely to kill my patient?'\" You hear this over and over as a PA-S. It's like the most clever thing an ER guy ever said or something. But when they ask for the fifth time you just say \"no, what?\" because they love to tell you the answer.\n\nSo there I was, eyes barely open, drool in corner of the mouth, waiting for this lecture to end after my turn at post call rounds so I could drive back home and hope I fell asleep at the wheel so a semitruck would put me out of my misery. When my preceptor, the trauma attending, asked,\n\n\"Do you know what separates us from ER doctors?\"\n\nOh God, I thought. This is it. The pinnacle of bad-assery in medicine. Because I already knew how ER docs thought, and now I was dying to know how trauma docs thought. My last four brain cells rallied to keep one eyelid open as I waited in eager anticipation to hear.\n\n\"ER doctors think 'what's the most likely diagnosis.' We think 'what's most likely to kill my patient?'\"\n\nI closed my eyes and put my head down on that cold, hard conference room table. Let him yell at me. This bastard can't hurt me anymore than he already has. I'm already cooked.",

I live in Ohio so I have to abide by the July 10 deadline for freely resigning without the boards approval. Well last week, after July 10, I was informed that they would be regressing my salary due to not accepting my post graduate credits. \n\nI never once doubted them taking my credits as my prior district did and the DOE recognized them for my licensure requirements. I really cannot financially afford to make less and have been losing sleep, hair, and weight worrying about it. Well today, I put in my resignation (very professional in verbiage) expressing a bit of the situation and how I would not be able to continue with the district due to financial hardship. \n\nI received an email which was unpleasant in tone and honestly seemed punitive stating that they are denying my resignation and will not allow me out of the contract. I did respond back laying out some facts and what not along with asking them to reconsider. \n\nI just don’t know what to do if they do not respond today as I would be required to go in Monday for an orientation. We have not started school and I have completed no work for them. I just am at a loss that I could be forced to remain in this contract or potentially get my license suspended. How would you expect a teacher to respond to that or enjoy coming into work after that? I do have other options within education in different districts which would pay more but I’m worried the state will come after my license. I don’t even know how to respond if they truly deny my resignation. \n\nI just don’t know what to do and am very discouraged and sad. \n\nEdit: This is the verbiage in my signed contract which was signed in June and I was not informed until July 23 of a change “Notice will be given annually, no later than July 1, to each Teacher who holds a contract valid for the succeeding year as to the salary\nto be paid such Teacher during such year.”\n\nEdit 2: thank you everyone for your advice! I have let them know that I will not be reporting for the 25/26 school year and any further communication will come from my legal counsel. I also got offered my dream job and that district is going to attempt to help me out! The thought of working at that school after all of this was making me sick so I feel better after sending that last email. ",

I get it, no degree required, remote work sounds great, and people hear about six-figure salaries for IT managers and think, “Why not me?”\n\nBut here’s the thing... just because the barrier to entry *looks* low doesn’t mean success is guaranteed. The field is getting oversaturated fast. Everyone’s trying to pivot into tech, especially from physical labor jobs, and while I understand the motivation, the reality isn’t as easy as it’s made out to be. Back in a day if you were a PC gamer you had a good chance. Now everyone is a PC gamer and they all think they can work in this field.\n\nIf you're over 35 and thinking of switching careers, be aware you’ll probably take a pay cut and might not see decent income until year three or four. IT also requires constant learning. New tech pops up all the time. It’s not a laid back job anymore, it’s a grind, and it’s competitive.\n\nWhat really gets me is when someone lands their first help desk role and a few months later starts asking how to become a cloud engineer or how to double their salary. Chill. You're not alone, everyone's trying to climb at the same time.\n\n**Edit:** I didn’t expect this to get so much attention, so I just want to clarify a few things. This post isn’t meant to discourage anyone from pursuing a career in IT. My goal was to bring awareness to the fact that the field is getting saturated and that success takes time and effort.\n\nIf you truly have a passion for IT, keep going, there’s absolutely a place for you. And ambition is a good thing! If you feel ready to move into a better role quickly, go for it. The point I wanted to make is that many people ask how to level up fast, and while that’s understandable... **experience matters a lot**. No one’s handing out senior roles unless you’ve built a solid foundation, or have really strong connections.\n\n**TL;DR: IT sounds great on paper, and yeah, a lot of people are rushing in, but it’s not the golden ticket people think it is. If you land a job, stick with it, build your experience, and take the long road. Otherwise, you’re just adding to the noise.**",

IT management, systems admin, network engineering, technical support, and lately, information security (more on that later).\n\nSome days all I do is reboot computers. Other times I'm negotiating with ISPs to run new fiber lines to our building or working with a web developer to redesign our company website, and other times I've got my head in the ceiling running cable to the new WAPs I researched, purchased, and installed myself, in order to support the boss's initiative of installing tablets on every CNC mill (I had to design that integration too).\n\nI can say with confidence that there is nobody else on staff who could even remotely do my job. I don't think anyone on staff even understands my job, or the true scope of what I do here.\n\nConsidering I'm a massive single point of failure, (at my insistence) we maintain a contract with an MSP who acts as my backup in case I get hit by a bus, but their involvement is minimal. They keep an eye on the server to ensure I'm not messing anything up and I reach out to them for advice every once in a while when I don't know how to do something, but that's about it. I handle 99% of day-to-day operations, as well as a lot of business management stuff that wouldn't be the MSP's responsibility.\n\nI make $30/hr. Same as what I started at when I assumed this position in 2018. I haven't gotten a raise in seven years despite the exponential increase in my responsibilities (when I first started, I as just meant to provide in-house tech support).\n\nWhile I was grateful for that kind of salary at the time, I can't help but feel now that I'm a little undervalued.\n\nWhat's more, management has been pushing for CMMC compliance lately since many of our clients are government. We're in the early stages and we've been working with some capable consultants who've been super helpful, but they won't stick around forever. When they leave, maintaining our InfoSec compliance will fall on me since there's nobody else on staff with the background to handle it and I know management won't want to spend the money on a full time InfoSec manager.\n\nTo be clear, I don't mind the workload. I'm ADHD and easily bored, so the fact that my job is different every day, that I'm always working on cool and exciting new projects is why I've been able to hold down this job for this long. I find it engaging and fulfilling and that's why I've tolerated being underpaid for years. In the past, I didn't want to risk rocking the boat with management and jeopardize a job I enjoy because I got greedy.\n\nThat said, I don't know if I can afford to undersell myself anymore. CoL keeps getting higher, and I'm already doing so much for so little and now management wants me to start handling all our InfoSec compliance too. I like my job, but I'm starting to feel that I'm getting taken advantage of.\n\nOn the other hand, I also know the tech job market is rough right now and in some ways I'm grateful to have a job in my field at all, so now more than ever I'm fearful of disrupting my stability by asking for too much.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice or guidance for me?\n\nI feel like I've got some powerful leverage. I have lost track of the number of critical systems that are wholly reliant on me, and this InfoSec stuff management is pushing onto me is necessary to secure lucrative defense contracts in the future (and retain a number of our existing clients).\n\nThat said, I don't want my bosses to feel like I'm holding their network hostage as a negotiation technique, since I feel that would immediately turn things hostile. Nor do I want to be fired for refusing to take on more work for no additional pay.\n\nSo, what would you do in this situation? How do I advocate for myself in a way that appeals to the owner's best interests instead of threatening them? Any words of wisdom from other IT pros would be greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\n\\[Edit\\] Thank you all for the feedback, I'm grateful. I can't respond to every comment but I assure you I'm reading them all.",

      "title": "From Railroad to IT: Career Change at 34—Now 40 and Grateful I Took the Risk",
      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI wanted to share my journey in case it helps someone who’s feeling stuck or unsure about making a career change later in life. Especially those of us in our 30s and 40s who wonder if it’s “too late” to start over.\n\nAt 34, I left a six-figure job as a freight train conductor. The money was good, but the 60+ hour weeks, dangerous work, and time away from my wife and newborn pushed me to rethink everything. I had no degree, no certs, and no professional IT experience—just a lifelong interest in computers and tech.\n\nI used my Post-9/11 GI Bill to enroll in community college for software development. After two years of pushing through advanced programming classes, I came to a tough but honest realization: I wasn’t built for coding. I just didn’t enjoy it—and that’s okay.\n\nThankfully, I landed an internship in a local school district’s IT department. I started out repairing Chromebooks and running cables, but the experience changed everything for me. I discovered how much I loved support work and being hands-on with users and systems. That internship turned into a full-time IT Support Technician role, where I worked with an amazing team and truly felt valued—for the first time in a long time.\n\nFrom there, I earned my BS in IT, and moved into a Systems Administrator role at a defense contractor. Within the first six months I picked up Security+, and a Secret Clearance. Currently in my second term working towards an MBA. \n\nEventually, I was promoted. Now a year later I am moving on to another Defense Contractor and will begin earning a salary that rivaled what I had at the railroad—but now I work 40 hours a week instead of 60+, I enjoy what I do, and I get to be there for my family. \n\nCareer Path Summary:\n\n2019 - Left Railroad, enrolled into school FT\n\n2020 – IT Intern (School District) – $16/hr\n\n2021 – IT Support Tech (School District) – $55K\n\n2023 – Systems Admin I (Defense Contractor) – $72K\n\n2024 – Promoted to Sys Admin II – $86K\n\n2025 – New Company as Info Systems Engineer II - $110k\n\nI’m 40 now. And I’m telling you—if you’re thinking about switching careers into IT, it’s not too late. But be honest with yourself. Don’t force yourself into a niche just for the salary. IT is a huge field. There’s a spot for everyone—support, networking, sysadmin, security, project management, you name it.\n\nIf I could tell my younger self one thing, it’d be this: Take the risk sooner. You can always recover from a wrong turn, but you can’t get back the time you didn’t try.\n\nIf anyone reading this is at a similar crossroads, feel free to reach out. I know how scary it is—but I also know how worth it it can be.\n\nWishing all of you the best in your journeys.",

      "title": "NO TAX on OT: Explained",
      "text": "If you work 2,080 straight-time hours at $50/hr, that’s $104,000. Add 500 overtime hours at time-and-a-half ($75/hr), that’s another $37,500, for a total of $141,500. For the “No Tax on Overtime” law, only the .5 premium ($25/hr in this case) counts toward the deduction. So 500 hours gives you $12,500 — the maximum allowed for a single filer. At a 22% bracket, that saves you about $2,750 in federal income tax (because it’s a deduction, not a tax credit — it lowers taxable income, it’s not cash back). Social Security, Medicare, and state income taxes are still withheld the same.\n\nThat 22% you hear about is just your federal income tax bracket on dollars in that range. Separately, every paycheck also has 7.65% for Social Security + Medicare taken out, and the new law doesn’t touch that. That’s why the savings are limited to income tax only.\n\nThis example assumes all 500 hours of OT are eligible. In practice, some OT won’t qualify:\n\t\nWeeks where you don’t actually work over 40 hours (like using vacation, holiday, or sick time). PTO counts as paid hours, but it’s not “worked hours” under the law.\n\nMinimum call-in pay (e.g. work 1 hour but get paid for 4) — only the hours actually worked are eligible.\n\nDouble time and any contractual premiums above 1.5x don’t qualify, although the law should still allow you to count the .5 premium portion of those hours.\n\nSo, realistically, it’s about the equivalent of a $1.32/hour raise if you hit the single-filer max. It’s better than nothing, but probably not what people imagined when they first heard “no tax on overtime.” A lot of folks thought they’d save 22% of their whole overtime check — tens of thousands in some cases. In reality, the maximum benefit is capped at about $2,750 for a single filer or $5,500 for a married couple assuming that couple worked 1,000 hours at that rate, equal to about $2.60 an hour on straight time.\n\nThis benefit starts in 2025 and sunsets after the 2028 tax year. The corporate tax benefits like the private jets deduction is permanent and obviously more important to the working class so our bosses can get around to keep making jobs for us :)",

      "text": "So the other day I went to a no-heat call and diagnosed a faulty gas valve. The furnace was about 20 years old, so I recommended replacing it instead of dumping money into it. The homeowner agreed since it made more sense long term.\n\nFast forward to today we went and installed a brand new furnace. My boss went to another job, so it was just me and another tech finishing everything up. After connecting everything, we realized we weren’t getting any gas. Checked the shutoff all good. The other tech asked if I turned off the gas at the meter, I said no but went to check anyway… and sure enough, the gas meter was locked. 🤦‍♂️\n\nSo yeah… that explains the “bad gas valve.” I know, dumb rookie mistake. I’ve been doing HVAC for about 9 months now, still learning every day.\n\nWhen we finished, I called my boss and he asked how the furnace job went. I told him everything’s good, we finished, but there was a slight problem. He’s like, “What happened?” I told him we weren’t getting gas, and he goes, “Don’t tell me the gas meter was locked.” I said, “Yeah…” and he’s like, “Oh shit, let me call you back.”\n\nFifteen minutes later he calls me and says the homeowner was pissed — and he ended up giving them the furnace for free and ate the cost. 😬\n\nHope you guys get a good laugh from my dumbass mistake.

      "text": "I've been seeing a lot of people on this subreddit who are immediately wanting to break into IT without putting in the time and effort to get to that position.\n\nMany people think that you can go into a coding or IT bootcamp for a couple weeks and fully expect to start making a 6 figure salary right out of the gate. \n\nI'm here to tell you that while it is possible, it is **extremely** unrealistic. I think a lot of this has to do with the recent cyber craze on social media where influencers are guaranteeing that you will make 6 figures if you just get into cybersecurity/IT. \n\nWith how the job market is right now, it is **crucial** that you have some IT experience on your resume before you think about going into any analyst or engineering position in IT. \n\nThat's why I believe that your rank in the IT market can easily be boosted by taking the shitty help desk IT positions whether it is fully remote, over the phone, or even in-person.\n\nBefore getting the position that I have now, I solely worked as technical support for multiple companies and I have to say that it has helped me get to the position I have today. It helps you build those soft-skills like probing, troubleshooting, and working with people who aren't as tech-savvy to get the information you need to properly help them. While these positions absolutely **SUCK** they will help you land that IT job of your dreams.\n\nI'd like to know what you all think, I'd love to hear different perspectives from current IT professionals and people who are looking into getting into IT.

      "text": "Just a quick rant. For some context, my family recently found out my grandfather has cancer and needs surgery to remove his tumor. My grandmother (retired RN) often comes to me for medicine advice or to chat about what’s going on from a medical perspective. We are able to discuss it in a way each of us understand, which we are unable to do with the rest of my non-medicine based family members.\n\nMy (28F) sister (30F) found out about that I was informed about my grandfather first, to which I said “[grandmother] trusts me with this to help since I work in healthcare”, and lost her shit. Mind you, my sister has some mental health issues so I am somewhat used to staying cool, calm and collected when we we argue.\n\nThis, however, is just too far. Why dedicate my life to a profession and specialty when this is how my own family members treat me and my career? I’m sick of pharmacists being under appreciated and undermined simply because people don’t understand what we do (and this goes for every type of pharmacist). It’s exhausting having to constantly advocate for our value in the medical field. I work very closely with physicians and APPs, and often provide most of the recommends for medicine treatment plans given the nature of my specialty. I bet if you ask everyone - including MDs, APPs, and support staff - who are the most valuable members of the team? 9 out of 10 would say the pharmacists.\n\nIt’s been a hard, tough week and getting this text just really hurts. I know she’s proud of me, but god damn. All I ever try to do is be supportive despite no one ever supporting me. \n\nAnyways, rant over. Thanks for listening &lt;3",

      "text": "I might come off as complaining, but it’s been 9 months since I started hunting for a new data engineering position with zero luck. After 7 years of doing DE (working with Oracle BI, self-hosted Spark clusters, and optimizing massive Snowflake and BigQuery warehouses) I’m feeling stuck. For the first time, I’ve made it to the final stages with 8 companies, but unlike before when I’d land multiple offers, I'm totally out of luck.\n\nWhat’s changed?\n\nWhy are companies acting like jerks?\n\nLast week, I had a design review meeting with an athletic clothing company, and the guy grilled me on specific design details that felt like his assigned homework; then he rejected me. I’ve spent days working on over 10 take-home assignments, and some looked like Jira tasks, only to get this: “While your take-home showed solid architectural thinking and familiarity with a wide range of data tools, the team felt you lacked the clarity and technical depth to match in the design review meeting.”\n\nSeriously? Last year, I was hiring a senior BI engineer and couldn’t find anyone who could write a left join SQL, and now I’m expected to write a query for complex marketing metrics on the fly and still fall short?\n\nHere’s what I’ve noticed:\n\n* Take-home assignments often feel like ticket work, not real evaluations.\n* Teams seem to gatekeep, shutting out anyone new.\n* There’s a huge gap between job descriptions and technical discussions. e.g., the JD and hiring manager were all about AWS Glue, but the technical questions were focused on managing and optimizing a self-hosted Spark cluster on Kubernetes.\n* Transferable skills get ignored. I’ve worked with BigQuery, Snowflake, Spark, Apache Beam, MongoDB, Airflow, Databricks, GCP, AWS, and set up Delta Lake in my assignment, but I couldn't recite the technical differences between Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake. Nope, not good enough. I got rejected.\n\nDo you guys really know all the technologies? Are you some sort of god or what? I can’t know every tech, but I can master anything new. why won’t they see that anymore?\n\nI’m tired of this crap! It’s not fair. No one values transferable skills anymore; they demand an exact match on tech stack, plus a massive time spent on prep work: online exams and technical assignments, only to get a “no” at the end.\n\n\\-----\n\n\\[EDIT\\]\n\nI'm not a victim here; I already have a job with decent pay, 17 years of experience, and I want to switch to a better team with a 10% pay cut because I have a shitty boss.\n\n\n\\-----\n\n\\[EDIT\\]\n\nGot a job offer after ten months of applying! And for 10% increase in my salary from a hiring manager who fought for me.\n\n I’m over the moon. Companies stole my code, got solutions and designs from me and then told me I lacked communication skills or totally ghosted me, disrespected me, and wasted my time and energy. But finally, I’ve got a solid offer from a decent company.\n\nIt was brutal, but it was possible. To anyone out there still searching: don’t lose hope. Stay calm, be stoic as much as you can, and protect yourself from burnout. This process is a numbers game. It’s tilted and unfair at times, but it’s still winnable..",

Probably 1 and a half years old. Walking, not really talking. She had a bottle in her mouth and she was sitting in the rocks near the street and she would get up and walk a couple steps and sit down and then I saw she wasn’t wearing any shoes or socks and she had a bottle of milk (It’s 111 degrees btw). I don’t want her to get run over by a car or burn her feet so I stop and get out. I walk up to her and say hello.

I pick her up and she immediately puts her head on my shoulder and hugs me. 🥹\n\nI carry her to the front door of what I suspect is her house. No doorbell so I just kinda shout through the screen for whoever is in there. An abuelita shows up and sees the girl and she’s like “oh adios mio! No no no no no! The. She starts yelling in Spanish at someone else in the house and this girl comes to the door and she’s stunned, concerned, embarrassed. She started apologizing profusely and I just said it’s okay.

      "text": "I relied a lot on stories and comments during my nursing school journey that I wanted to give back and share my story. In 2019 I was working as an Admin for a company which was extremely unrewarding. The company leaders didn’t seem to care much about the employees or the customers it was all about making money. Giving them all my time and effort made me feel like part of the problem. I had this desire to do something more meaningful, so I thought hey, I’ll be a nurse! At the time I had zero knowledge of how competitive nursing was where I live (Washington State). I approached a local community college that had a nursing program and despite the advisor telling me not to bother unless I got straight A’s I started taking my pre-requisites Fall quarter of 2019. The advisor was wrong, it’s competitive for sure but it’s also possible w/out straight A’s! I was working full time, so I completed my pre-requisites very slowly (1 or 2 at a time).  \nI transferred to a school closer to home and had to complete 3 more classes since their program was slightly different, but this school was literally 10 minutes from home opposed to my first school being over 1 hour away (it was closer to my admin job). I completed a CNA course, quit my admin job, and worked as a CNA for a year prior to starting nursing school which I loved though CNA’s are extremely underpaid.    \nI found nursing school to be very all-consuming. It’s fairly complex content but then you also have labs in which you must physically demonstrate your ability to complete nursing tasks. It was intimidating being in classes with students who were more my son’s age than mine but everyone was very accepting. My school had an 80% pass rate with tests and assignments averaged together.  \nI would say that nursing school essentially took over my life for the past 2 years. I would study anywhere from 6 to 15 hours per week depending on what was due. I really couldn’t give time or energy to much else and there were times I questioned if it would all be worth it. During the tougher times I don’t know if I would have recommended it to myself but during the better times I would recommend it to anyone looking for a new path. Nursing school was a stressful but amazing journey! I made some great friends and learned a whole lot. I also learned that I was more capable than I gave myself credit for!  \nNever judge if you should try based on your age! If you feel up to the challenge and have a desire to seek out a job that is rewarding and makes you feel like you’re making a positive difference then certainly don’t let your age hold you back!",

      "title": "PSA:  CVS is not worth taking your life over. Please read.",
      "text": "In light of the recent pharmacist suicides, I just felt like I needed to make an urgent PSA to my fellow pharmacists and especially new grads who may feel like they are in or close to being in the same “situation”, especially at the shithole that is CVS Pharmacy. \n\nThe TLDR is: \n\nDON’T. DO.  IT. \n\nDo NOT attempt suicide. Please. \n\nCVS does NOT deserve your life. \n\nYou will get through it and look back and be glad you didn’t. I promise. I have been there. Nothing is permanent, nothing is forever.  This period of time is a nothingburger in the bigger picture of life. \n\nCVS is not the end. THEY NEED YOU MORE THAN YOU NEED THEM. Trust me. \n\n————————————\n\n/////////// STORY TIME /////////////\n\nIn early 2019, I contemplated finding a way to kill myself in the bathroom at the CVS I was managing (it’s always the bathroom). And it wasn’t even a bad location. I just felt…trapped….like most of the pharmacists currently working at CVS. Like this was what my entire future was going to be now, riddled in student debt in an oversaturated field, and I was replaceable….and there was no way out of this life if I wanted to become debt free and start living my life.  \n\nI was stressed, I was trapped….I was clinically depressed to point of no return. It didn’t help that NOBODY in my family understood my pain. I couldn’t talk to anyone. I wanted to cease to exist.\n\nA small part of me, however, was still fighting. \nPartly because of how much I hated CVS. I initially thought killing myself in the bathroom would send a message. I thought I’d be a martyr, that my death would help bring to light the evil that is CVS. \n\nBut I thought more closely and came to realize I was wrong.  My death would be swept under the rug and only my family and friends would suffer.  Time will pass, and nobody would remember me for being brave. I’d just be another statistic.\n\nI wasn’t going to let that happen for CVS.  \n\nSo I decided to leave at the first chance I get. If I was going to be depressed, I sure as hell wasn’t going to be depressed in a sweatshop. Let me be depressed just sitting behind a computer. \n\nI didn’t know if my depression would ever subside or if I’d forever be in this state of pain. They say depression lingers, and since fluoxetine was not helping, I was prepared to live with this pain forever. \n\nBut holy hell.  \n\nWithin 2 months of leaving, one random day…I physically felt the clouds finally lifting! The colors came seeping back into my life. Hopes and dreams of the past came back, optimistic feelings came back. I came back. To life. All in one sitting. It was wild. \n\nIt was a feeling I’ll always remember cause I really didn’t think it was possible. I finally quit the fluoxetine. \n\nLooking back now, I can see clearly that CVS was my source of pain. That what seemed so overwhelming and dramatic at that time….was just merely a brief, tiny speck of anguish in the grand scheme of things. I wasn’t able to see it then because of the nature of depression. \n\nBut I’m SOOOO glad I didn’t go through with the bathroom plan. I’ve been THRIVING and SLAYING ever since….all the while CVS is struggling more than ever. I’m so glad I did not let them win over me.  \n\nAnd I want people to know that.  As cliche as it sounds, there IS a light at the end of the tunnel. You have so much life left to live after CVS. Don’t worry bout your student debt. That too shall pass. Don’t worry bout trying to make metrics or appease your Karens. They’ll always be there. Don’t worry about getting fired. THEY NEED YOU MORE THAN YOU NEED THEM.  \n\nJust do your job, take care of your patients as best as you can, and get out. Easier said than done. But it can happen. Make the moves necessary to make it happen.  \n\nAnd if for some reason you can’t just yet, just keep this in mind:  nothing is permanent. Nothing is forever. Except death that is unnecessary. But you are not trapped or helpless.  You will make it out alive. \n\nPlease talk to someone. Someone you trust and can talk to easily. If I were back in that situation, I’d find a therapist. A good therapist is worth their weight in salt.  You just need someone from the outside with a clearer mindset to bring you back to reality and keep you sane and grounded. \n\n Don’t be afraid to reach out. ",

      "title": "Actual Pharmacist Side Hustles",
      "text": "I wanted to post this to discuss actual side hustles that don't include the typical answers to the side hustle posts.  These are all side hustles I have engaged in, or have personally known witnessed other pharmacists to engage in for money. \n\n1. This is not a retirement and saving post. Please save that advice for an appropriate thread. This post is made with the assumption everyone has done that already. We've already been to our financial advisor, so don't waste anyone's time with those comments. This is for people who wanna  ball out, or people like me who have crazy student loan debt and don't want to wait 20+ years, or sit at a job we don't like and pray to our corporate overloads/rapidly destabilizing government to forgive our loans.  Same thing with FIRE.  I get it; it's excellent, but this post is about MAKING Money, NOT Saving.  So put those comments elsewhere. \n\nThat being said, if you haven't got your savings plan in order, stop reading, see a financial advisor, and return to this when you're done.\n\n\n2. Let's address obvious stuff so once again, the thread doesn't get filled with posts about just working more hours. Duh. Try to get overtime and a PRN job. These are the easiest ways to make more money (but don't count as \"side\" hustles; it's just more of the same stuff you already do. So, let's not waste people's time on this thread with the obvious.\n\nOK HERE ARE THE ACTUAL TIPS:\n\n3. Incorporate yourself-  These are real side hustles; as such, they will require time, money, and effort to make any money. I don't think passive income exists, so if you're looking for ideas about passive income, you won't find them here. The first step is incorporating yourself so that the money you spend getting any of these side hustles started actually comes back to you at the end of the year, and that that money you make from these side hustles doesn't just end up getting funneled directly to uncle sam ( I used Bizee.com)  its super easy they take care of everything for you.  there is no reason not to do so. If you have questions about that, ask in the comments or DM me\n\n\n4. Consulting - Don't sleep on it.  at the end of this year, this will be my most significant source of income. there are several ways to get into consulting, and once you start consulting, there are multiple ways to get paid for a single project and limitless possibilities to grow.  You can start by contacting larger consulting firms that need pharmacist insight.  If you have experience(compounding, Purchasing, or are in a decision-making role, you can make decent money for low to no startup cost and time), I make 60$ per survey and 250/hr on a phone call/zoom meeting to answer questions.  ALpha1 insights is a good place to start. I also started my own consulting firm, which is now my main source of income and will allow me to quit my full-time w2 job by 2026.\n\n\n5. SALES - grew out of meeting and talking to people while consulting. Several Tech companies looking to break into the pharmaceutical industry. It pays handsomely if you can help them converse with healthcare systems or give feedback on their products.  I currently have 5 companies I work with, once again low, with startup costs and high rewards. For most of them, I get 2500/sale, or for managing an ongoing client, I get 1k/month per client for as long as that client remains a customer.  ( it takes a lot of time; I'm always on my phone,  and I'm sure my coworkers think I have a social media addiction, but I'm actually making $$$$ while I'm making $$$ lol ).  A good way to do this is to go to conferences and NOT TALK TO THE PHARMACISTS.  Talk to the people who actually own the businesses and technology. Show an interest in their product.  Understand that most of the people who are actually making real $$ in our industry are not Pharmacist ( hell I know technicians using this strategy that are making more money than any PharmD I know)\n\n\n6. Freelance Medical writing - this one is a bit more difficult but, when done well can actually pivot you into a career in the industry, or you can keep it as a side hustle (my initial intent with this was to try and backdoor myself into the pharmaceutical industry, but I actually just ended up offering it as a service in conjunction with my consulting company).  ASHP has an AMAZING course on Medical writing. It's like 600 $, but I think it's well worth it. I did the course and then immediately went to find some freelance work. Can't find freelance work? It's probably because you suck; write your own stuff for free until you don't suck ( start a health blog or something. Don't worry about the $$ yet). Once you have a portfolio of stuff that doesn't suck, you should be able to get freelance work.  once you have a decent reputation for doing that, you may be able to get some Medical review work (reviewing stuff other people write for accuracy).  Hint (GLP1 - RAs are a hot topic right now.) \n\n\n7. MA for Clinics - Want a fresh slap in the Face as a PharmD? Medical assistants have more prescriptive authority than you do ( at least in my state).  I want some hope as a PharmD - MAs, NPs, PAs, and many young MDs have no idea how to write RXs and hate taking phone calls about correcting their Rxs. Right now, there is a gold rush in the wellness space where MDs and mid-levels are opening independent clinics. They don't have software, and they don't have guidance on how to write for compounds; you can offer to remotely help send (predraft their RXs) and/or take phone calls about RX issues for them. Find a health spa, work out a contract, and get paid; you can literally do as much of this as you can handle. I have yet to be turned down. You can easily talk a spa owner out of their shitty MA; even if you cost a lot more, they have had an MA constantly interrupt their appointments to ask them simple questions; you solve that problem.\n\n\n8. Multi-state licensure - all you can do with multi-state licensure can be its own post.  Im talking 10 + states. It's expensive, but you can write it off once you incorporate it yourself. This is a fantastic move, especially if you are single and unattached.  it takes time and effort.  DM me if you want more specifics about what you can do with multi-state licensure. If I get enough comments/DMs about it, I may do its own post.  I have a post about the fastest way to knock out an MPJE. I got 10 licenses in one year while working full-time with that method.\n\n\n9. ACPE and other accreditation bodies accredited course/content creation - (DISCLAIMER I HAVENT GOTTEN PAID FROM THIS YET). I know some Pharmacists who get paid to create CE content and are currently working on a course ( and guess what? It's not even for pharmacists ). I haven't gotten a dime yet, and I am a lead on the project but not the sole contributor)  this was born out of my medical writing projects. I will only encourage you to try it with a grain of salt.  I have sunk a ton of time into this so far, and I hope it pays off. The idea is that once the project is complete, we can get paid for it regularly until the content's expiration date. It is too early for me to recommend it wholeheartedly, but I will update this thread later(someone holds me accountable for the Update lol)\n\n\n10. Public speaking -  another disclaimer because I haven't actually done this myself, but I personally know someone who does this)  all of these pharmacies (and other organizations) that have all these conferences are apparently DYING to find public speakers.  (yeah, that pit in your stomach you get from just saying public speaking is probably why)   but if you're an actual extrovert in a field full of introverts, you can clean up by taking public speaking gigs to reach out. A lot of the time, even at pharmacy conferences, the people who are doing the talking aren't even pharmacists. You can also get Zoom gigs ( they pay a lot less ). Some of the conference gigs pay 5-10k +. I would reach out to any org/company that does live CE or conferences and see if you can get a slot, build a portfolio. Once again, I'm not writing from a ton of experience, but I have seen evidence that this can be lucrative.\n\n\n\nThis is all I have so far, but please comment if you have other ideas. I would love to hear and try them. GOOD LUCK!\n\n",

      "text": "(EDIT: I am fully credentialed in the state of California and have taught here for 2 years. Some people misunderstood and thought I only held a Texas license)\n\nYes, there is a \"teacher shortage,\" but as someone who moved from Texas to California a few years ago and who is facing an endless loop of the temporary contract/hiring freeze game, I don't think people outside of education get it. I mean, if I had a special education credential of any kind I may have a lot of choices. If I were credentialed to teach Spanish, too. \n\nI'm really frustrated because I am SO overqualified with over 20 years of experience, awards, achievements, blah blah blah, and I WANT to teach EL newcomers which has historically been a difficult position to fill, but there is ZIP out there that I am credentialed to teach. And people are like \"simply move,\" as if I can just uproot my entire family's life. \n\nI really, really don't want to sub and I really, really don't want to teach at a charter. Hell, even charters and private schools are pretty dry right now. Declining enrollment has me pretty bummed out. \n\nAnyway, just wanted to commiserate with anyone in the same situation. I thought I was done hustling and grinding with a more stable job, but here I am with 21 years of experience and a master's degree sadly applying to charters an hour away and sadly looking at the meager salary of online ESL teachers.",

      "title": "My push back against judging parents. ",
      "text": "Someone posted a post about their judgement towards students' work ethic and how these students are simply the product of poor parenting.\n\nI want to critique this. As a teacher, I don't really judge parents. I take it a step further: I judge our entire society and its **failings**. Children are the creations of their parents, and their parents are the creations of society. And whatever subliminal messaging the parent recieved, the child will recieve.\n\nOn the internaitonal stage, the United States rarely ranks highly when it comes to k-12 education, and we especially rank low when it comes to math scores. (sorry for being American centric. I am American; therefore, this is the only country I can speak on).\n\nLet's say a parent comes from a lower socioeconomic background. *Their* parents were not able help them on their education and their mom and dad were always busy working at their low-paying jobs. This parent would go to school, and they struggled in reading and writing AND math and science. They graduated high school with a 1.8 GPA. After they finish high school, they work at the local factory or Mcdonanld's, and at 23, they have a child.\n\nThe cycle of low achievement and low educational prosperity continues in their child. Now you are probably thinking, how is this the fault of American society?\n\nThe schools the parent and child went to didn't have enough funding. The teachers were given a low salary. The class sizes were too big. Because of issues with funding, there weren't any paras or teaching assistants to ease the burden off the teachers. The low-paying job the parent worked didn't assist them with going back to school. They didn'tget any PTO; therefore, if they try to stay home with their kids, they will lose money.\n\nAll of these problems are societal and governmental issues that state and federal governments can help allievate.\n\nAs educators, we need to understand something really important about our education system: we are working within a country that doesn't prize educational achievement for **ALL** of its citizens. Therefore, how I can I throw my nose up in the air at a child or parent who obviously weren't even given a fighting chance to begin with?\n\n**TLDR: As an educator, start seeing the bigger picture. The problem with contemporary American education is more than \"bad parenting.\" It is a societal problem that starts all the way at the federal level.**",

      "title": "20k&gt;162k in 8 years. Here’s how it happened.",
      "text": "This is gonna be long as shit. Sorry.\n\nI keep getting asked about my job progression when I post about my current salary, and I figure it’s about time to post one of these career maps to help others get a sense of how I got here. Keep in mind, when I broke into IT it was definitely easier than it is now, but I still think the path I took still exists for anyone motivated beyond just money and finding a cushy remote gig. This played out in the Greater Boston area where cost of living has skyrocketed so your mileage may vary.\n\nBefore this, I worked retail for 7 years at the same grocery store from 16 to about 23. I went full time training to be a front end dept head because I really had no other prospects and I didn’t yet know IT was a plausible career for me without having a degree. I worked for an extremely toxic manager and got panic attacks about engaging with her at work. I began trying to find any way out and started looking into how to break into IT. This went into overdrive when I quit on the spot one day after I found out she launched an over the top investigation into me being short 15 dollars after I performed a drawer sweep. Anywho, onto the good stuff. I had a few roles on here that I won’t list because I was at them for less than a month each.\n\n**First Role: Cell Phone Repair for 20k from 2016 to 2017**\n\nI was here for one year. This role wasn’t glamorous, didn’t pay well, and was very far from home. Fortunately, I was young and still living with my folks. I didn’t have an A+ and didn’t have the patience to get one, so I did the best I could to find ANYTHING tech adjacent, which landed me here. I fixed phones and consumer laptops. The job sucked monetarily and I hated commuting there but I actually met some lifelong friends there who I am still very close with now. I kept my eyes on the plan, and told myself to stick it out for the good of my career. I did a year there.\n\n**Second role: Imaging PCs and doing light desktop support for 33k from 2017 to 2018**\n\nI was here for one year. Another role that wasn’t glamorous but I was so excited to just be away from retail and doing something that got me on my way to a career in IT. I spent my days imaging laptops for employees, prepping dozens of lab devices for projects, troubleshooting issues that came up during both processes and kinda just dicking around with my Nintendo Switch while PCs ran through scripts. I left this job for a role at an MSP for about 55k that I ended up leaving after 3 weeks due to a highly aggressive commute, a toxic atmosphere, and a profound sense that I made a wrong decision.\n\n**Third role: Small business sysadmin for 55k from 2018 to 2019**\n\nI credit this role with launching my career in a real way. I interviewed for a “Help Desk” job with a small manufacturing company, about 60 people. At the interview I learned they wanted much more than just help desk. They wanted to fire their MSP, and have the candidate run their environment entirely. Systems, network, licensing, budgeting, infosec, backup and DRDA, you name it. Funny enough, when I posted about this role before accepting it a certain cranky system administrator on this board told me the experience was going to teach me awful habits and I’d never be able to transition to a big company.\n\nI was way under qualified but if I learned anything from years of browsing this sub it’s that breaking the sysadmin ceiling is the hardest thing to do in IT and I was eager to do it so I rose to the occasion. I took on way too much for (in hindsight) painfully little pay but I learned a lot. I put SSDs in their old PCs, gutted their old box servers in favor of new hypervisors, set up folder redirection their devices, enrolled them into 365, etc. It was a lot of modernization for them and I learned a lot. I also took on a lot of super unique and weird issues. Weirdest I saw was having to fix the PC that was attached to a 50 year old cutting instrument. Ever try troubleshooting RAM issues in DOS? There’s not much info online I’ll tell you, and finding 32kb of free RAM is harder than you might think.\n\n**Fourth role: System Admin for 65k from 2019 to 2020**\n\nThis job sucked. I was hired to be a sysadmin but was a glorified help desk level 2. My boss was flaky and the job was unsatisfying. The interview process tossed up red flags left and right and I learned a lot about scrutinizing opportunities that seem too good to be true from that experience. I was laid off right before the pandemic. Role lasted about 7 months total.\n\n**Fifth role: MSP System Engineer for 72k (left at 86k) from 2020 to 2022**\n\nSysadmin duties and long term consulting and planning for Biotech startups and small businesses. A lot of cloud planning, a little MDM, a lot of jack of all trades’ing. I don’t find this job to have been very stimulating to my skill set but the perks were cushy and most of my clients let me come and go as I pleased. I worked from home when I wanted and came onsite when I wanted (outside of situations where I was actively needed)\n\n**Sixth and current role: Infrastructure Engineer for 143k (currently at 162k) from 2022 to now**\n\nOnsite three days, work from home two days. Four hours of on call a month and needing to be available for major outages that might impact business the following weekday.\n\nAll sysadmin and engineering duties as needed. This role was where I finally was able to consider myself a network engineer. A lot of our systems are abstracted into datacenters and our core network egress and ingress point is routed states away, so a lot of what I was used to working on (patching, hypervisor management, storage, etc) is being managed by an MSP (who also hosts our datacenter) so I had to skill up elsewhere.\n\nI spend my days doing a mix of everything. A lot of network hardening for our branch locations, biggest project last year was setting up failover DMVPN circuits. I also take part in lots of app rollouts, server and system builds, and the in house automations for the company like SFTP transfers and coordinating privileged access to things like our DMZ. This year the big one is MDM rollout with Intune and Windows 11 (MDM and Cloud I think are my long term aspirations). We are a bank and half of my job is fighting with our limitations imposed because of auditors.\n\nAll of this growth happened without a degree or a single cert to speak of, although I can tell that I’m maxing out on what I can achieve without one of the two. For certs I’m targeting CCNA (I find myself to be able to hold my own on the network side now, but I really want to make sure I have my gaps covered), Azure Administrator, and MDM Administrator in the near future.",

      "text": "This is not just a one time thing, but I’ve actually seen it on NP program curriculums, websites, NP forum here on reddit, and other various online sources that many NP programs only allow preceptors to be “NP or physician” it may initially seem insignificant (which in the grand scheme it is), but it really shows you NP programs and AANP’s true colors. They genuinely believe they’re above PAs to the point that some/many programs don’t let their students be precepted by PAs. It’s honestly hilarious and so delusional. If they believe NP = physician so much we PAs should honestly all stop precepting NP students overall. They already have a hard time getting preceptors. I just am never surprised anymore by the audacity of NPs. Truly tho, the one thing nurses know how to do is talk up about how amazing they are and better than everyone else. Their self confidence is literally out of this world. \n\nThis is not an attack on NPs at the individual level but moreso how the NP profession tries to poise itself as God’s gift to patients. \n\nHere is an example of a very misinformed and indoctrinated NP in the comments. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/physicianassistant/s/S2AXHpztPF\n\nShe says NPs are “more specialized”, “more qualifed”, since “most NPs have a DNP” (which ~14% is not most NPs) and due to nursing lobby really fighting for FPA makes “NPs better to precept PAs”. I’m telling y’all THESE are the kinds of NPs the online NP diploma mills are producing. These NPs then go online to social media where they spew this baseless and incorrect rhetoric to everyone who then believes it because they’re a “nurse”. \n\nShe also said PAs are “med school flunkies” and NPs are better because they went into “advanced nursing”. She MUST be trolling. \n\nThis NEEDS to be a wake up call for PAs. I’m sure there are great NPs out there, but the batches they are churning out now are just awful and have an unfounded superiority complex.

      "text": "Hey folks,  \nThrowaway for normal reasons. I need to get this off my chest and maybe hear if others have been through similar.\n\nI relocated country (EU) for what seemed like a promising hybrid sysadmin role at a mid-sized company. The job was advertised as hybrid, the salary was good, and I was excited. The CEO personally signed off on my relocation package, and I had a good feeling about the company overall.\n\nBut the reality has been brutal.\n\nFrom day one, my direct manager (let’s call him “T”) has been cold, rigid, and toxic. He micromanages obsessively, contradicts himself constantly. When a close family member of my partner passed away, I asked if he minds that I WFH to support her — his response? “I do mind.” That was it. No empathy, no follow-up, no human decency. Other employees in the company work remotely without issue. When I asked why I couldn’t, the excuse kept changing — from “I can’t defend more than one WFH day” (Defend from who? No idea.) to “IT needs to be onsite,” then “the company doesn’t offer remote or hybrid,”(It does) and finally “your job is full-time, not hybrid” even though the job ad literally said hybrid he tried gaslighting me that full time jobs cant be hybrid... \n\nWhen my performance review came around, key projects I had led — including a full Webex rollout, IVR config, and call routing and forwarding that took weeks — weren’t even mentioned. He just said I hadn’t met expectations on 3 things I missed over the course of a year. No coaching, no feedback at the time of, just more responsibilities dumped on me and then used against me later.\n\nSince our service desk role was cut, I’ve been doing both that and my main job. When I asked for flexibility or help, I was told the service desk “runs itself” — but also that I couldn’t WFH because the service desk needs someone onsite. Which is it?\n\nHR seemed receptive when I raised concerns at first. They even suggested a 2-day WFH week trial to him — but he changed his mind without telling me or them. At the latest meeting, I was just *told* that I wouldn’t be getting the second WFH day. No discussion. No Compromise. When I pointed out that I’m already burning out and that I *need* the flexibility to improve my performance, he said I need to *perform better first* before I get the second day. Like asking a plant to grow before watering it. I am so fucking tired.\n\nI feel like I’m being managed out — like they’re not outright firing me, just slowly pushing me to the edge. HR advised I start looking for a role that better meets my needs (so quit). They hinted they might waive my relocation repayment fee, so at this point it feels like they’re leaving the door open for me.\n\nThe rest of the company? Amazing. I genuinely enjoyed working with the other teams. But T has completely poisoned the well. I've put so much effort into this job, learned the systems, supported users, picked up others’ slack. And now I’m being squeezed out just for asking to be treated like a human being.\n\nI've got some hopeful interviews lined up, one in final stages for a fully remote role that would be an ideal fit. But the damage this place has done to my confidence and mental health… it's going to take a while to bounce back. My only silver lining is that T is going to drown in the work left for him ***when*** my role is empty. \n\nAnyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far. If you’ve been through similar, I’d love to hear how you handled it. I feel exhausted, angry, and just really fucking disappointed. \n\n**Warning to younger techs:**  \nIf, like I was, you are early in your IT Support career and lucky enough to have decent management, supportive culture — *do not romanticize moving to “the customer side” for more ownership or technical freedom*. The grass isn't greener, it's just turf over a minefield. Don't end up like me: total responsibility, no support, no trust, and no way out but through. Learn from my pain and trust your guy when the red flags fly — don’t find out the hard way. \n\n— Burned Out Sysadmin",

      "text": "I just began my first clinical and a few weeks before they talked with us about expectations. They said they wanted us to perform certain tasks in front of our clinical instructor before we did them independently. I didn't memorize them, but they were anything invasive or that could cause harm if done poorly. They also made a big deal about being generally available to help out with other patients if ours didn't need us (we are assigned to just one).\n\nFlash forward to yesterday. It is the first day and things are going great. My patient decides to rest up so I go out looking to see what I can do to help classmates or staff. I noticed a call light going off and no one else was nearby. I approach the room and see the patient has wheeled themselves to the bathroom. I ask if they need help and they said they needed help getting on the toilet. They are right there already just need to transfer. They tell me they stand and pivot, so I help them stand up. We are pivoting when I suddenly hear my clinical instructor outside the door. They say in a concerned and stern voice, \"\\*InfamouSandman\\*, are you in there?\" I reply, \"Yes, just helping a patient to the bathroom.\" They then continue in the same voice, \"Can I talk with you out here for a second when you are done?\" \n\nMy heart drops. Am I really not allowed to help a patient to the bathroom without supervision? This isn't even my patient. Am I about to get in trouble for helping a random patient in need? Are they really about to send me home from clinical for helping a patient to the bathroom? I suddenly remember reading about weird stuff like that happening at clinicals. \n\nOnce the patient is on the toilet, they thank me and tell me I have a great bedside manner with a grateful nod. I make sure they know how to call for help when they are done, then quickly exit the room to see my clinical instructor looking pale and concerned. \"Everything went okay in there?\" I'm nervous. \"Yea. They really needed help and seemed grateful.\" They look relieved, \"That's great!\" The color comes back to their face. \n\n\"I should have posted this earlier, but that patient is on our 'do not contact' list because of how they treat people,\" they continue. \"I dunno if they are physically or verbally abusive but they want us to stay away for safety.\"  \n\n\"Oh,\" I shrug. \"Well they were super nice to me and told me I had great bedside manner.\" \n\nThey laugh. \"Well great job then!\"\n\nYou all might have heard my audible sigh of relief from wherever you were yesterday.\n\nEverything else went fine! I just need to get used to patient care plans, but I think I will be alright!",

      "text": "I’ve gone back and forth on the issue of independent practice rights for PAs over the years, but I’ve come to fully support it, and here’s why.\n\nFor the past decade, “supervision” has been mostly symbolic. In most of my jobs, it has meant a physician signs a form when I get hired, and that’s the end of their involvement. I’m the one seeing patients, making clinical decisions, prescribing, ordering tests, and managing follow ups. If I need help, I consult, just like any competent provider would. But the idea that I legally need a supervising physician when they’re not actively involved in my decisions just doesn’t reflect reality.\n\nAdministrators have had far more influence over my clinical decisions than any of the physicians listed as my supervisor. I’ve worked in urgent care, primary care, and rural medicine, and in all of those settings I’ve been expected to carry my own load and manage my own patients. I am responsible for outcomes, and I carry malpractice insurance at the same level as the physicians I work with.\n\nWhat’s frustrating is that if I ever wanted to open my own practice, I would have to pay a physician I may not even know to be listed as my “supervisor.” That arrangement doesn’t benefit patient care. It’s just a regulatory hurdle that restricts PAs from growing professionally.\n\nI totally get that not all fields are the same. In most specialties or high acuity settings, supervision and structured oversight are appropriate. But in general practice, I’ve already been functioning independently for years.\n\nNurse practitioners in many states already have full practice authority, and that is never going to be undone. There’s no reason experienced PAs shouldn’t have the same opportunity. Independent practice does not mean working in a silo. It means practicing with autonomy while still collaborating when needed, just like every other clinician.\n\nIt’s time to recognize what’s already happening in the real world.\n\nAnd to the bitter, underpaid residents on Noctor who love to hate on PAs and NPs: I get it. You’re exhausted, buried in debt, and watching someone make more than you while working fewer hours feels infuriating. But there is a light at the end of the tunnel for you. Once you’re done, you’ll have the autonomy, the income, and the recognition that you’ve worked so hard for.\n\nAs for me, I didn’t have the luxury of going straight through undergrad and into med school. I grew up poor. I was in my 30s retaking science classes while working full-time just to get into PA school. Med school wasn’t an option for me, financially or logistically. I chose the path that was possible, and I’ve built a career I’m proud of.\n\nSo no, I’m not trying to be a doctor. I’m a PA. And like many others in this profession, I’m just asking for the right to practice at the level I’ve already been working at for years, with honesty, accountability, and independence.\n",

This is about science. Chiropractic care, as it is still widely practiced today, includes interventions that are not supported by evidence, and in some cases are actively harmful.

      "text": "I’ve been playing with the “Careless Whisper” side-channel idea and hacked together a small PoC that shows how you can track a phone’s **device activity state** (screen on/off, offline) via WhatsApp – without any notifications or visible messages on the victim’s side.\n\n\n\n**How it works (very roughly):**  \n\\- uses WhatsApp via an unofficial API  \n\\- sends tiny “probe” reactions to special/invalid message IDs  \n\\- WhatsApp still sends back silent delivery receipts  \n\\- I just measure the round-trip time (RTT) of those receipts\n\n\n\nFrom that, you start seeing patterns like:  \n\\- low RTT ≈ screen on / active, usually on Wi-Fi  \n\\- a bit higher RTT ≈ screen on / active, on mobile data  \n\\- high RTT ≈ screen off / standby on Wi-Fi  \n\\- very high RTT ≈ screen off / standby on mobile data / bad reception  \n\\- timeouts / repeated failures ≈ offline (airplane mode, no network, etc.)\n\n\\*depends on device\n\n\n\nThe target **never sees any message, notification or reaction**. The same class of leak exists for Signal as well (per the original paper).  \n\nIn theory you’d still see this in raw network traffic (weird, regular probe pattern), and on the victim side it will slowly burn through a bit more mobile data and battery than “normal” idle usage.\n\n\n\nOver time you can use this to infer behavior:  \n\\- when someone is probably at home (stable Wi-Fi RTT)  \n\\- when they’re likely sleeping (long standby/offline stretches)  \n\\- when they’re out and moving around (mobile data RTT patterns)\n\nSo in theory you can slowly build a profile of when a person is home, asleep, or out — and this kind of tracking could already be happening without people realizing it.\n\n**Quick “hotfix” for normal users:**  \nGo into the privacy settings of WhatsApp and Signal and turn off / restrict that unknown numbers can message you (e.g. WhatsApp: Settings → Privacy → Advanced). The attack basically requires that someone can send stuff to your number at all – limiting that already kills a big chunk of the risk.\n\nMy open-source implementation (research / educational use only):  [https://github.com/gommzystudio/device-activity-tracker](https://github.com/gommzystudio/device-activity-tracker)\n\nOriginal Paper:  \n[https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11194)",

I told him about travelling across the world, working in hospice, having a private therapy practice, and showed him a wedding photo. He was thrilled to hear my reduction in medication and said he knew Olanzapine always worked the best for me. He thanked me for stopping by and said it was a proud full circle moment to see me thriving and happy. He said I always had the passion, drive, and goals— I just had a clouded brain with mental illness. 2 years mania-free probably made him the happiest of all. \n\nNot sure I’ll ever see him again; extremely thankful for this chance though. \n\n—\nI have several chronic health issues, physical and mental. Notably, bipolar that was severely untreated for many years. I got to know the pharmacist who worked overnights because I would be manic at 3am and call him incoherent, manic. He eventually advocated for me to be prescribed a manic protocol so he could *do something* when I was in such distress. \n\nAnd, voila. 10-40mg Olanzapine, 15-30mg Temazapam max 3 day supply. Even as a social worker now I have literally never seen anything similar replicated even by people with similar diagnoses/chronic symptomology. \n\nThat kept me out of the hospital…seriously I haven’t been back to the ER or admitted for MH since. But I’ve used that protocol many times. It works— he knew I’d work because he knew I would get that in crisis at the ER and he thought (I guess) why not outpatient the same thing??\n\nHe really cared for my wellbeing. Went above and beyond and beyond. He knew I got agitated waiting in line. He knew what set me off or made me paranoid. He knew my file even though it was complex and evolving. (15+ PO meds, 3-4 IV— I had a port a cath) \n\nI’m telling you my medications were VERY complicated and I was STILL unwell. Being treated for epilepsy only to find out it was narcolepsy a couple YEARS later. I was severely manic every couple months. \n\nEven when I moved away, if I needed something he would still pick up the phone. \n\nI haven’t seen him since 2020 or talked to him since 2021. I happen to be vacationing where he works and I’m gunna stop by and let him know I recovered, became a social worker, got married, bought a home, and getting ready for a baby. \nAnd…manic protocol no longer active, 2+ yrs no episode. \n\nHe will be proud— but also hella surprised. \nHe never gave up on me when most of the medical system had— lost cause, chronic user of the system, poor prognosis. \n\nSo ya, the customers who are needy and kinda annoying but you also kinda empathize: we do recover. And sometimes that support is a pharmacist. For me, this person was accessible, knowledgeable, and gave a damn. \n\nTy for what y’all do. ",

      "title": "What's your unpopular opinion about teaching? Things you think but can't exactly say in a staff meeting?",
      "text": "I'm unsure if my opinions are unpopular, but these are things I've encountered during my time working in schools.\n\n1) Getting a teaching job is actually pretty hard.  I think it's a competitive field.  Having a Masters degree increases your chances heavily instead of just having a BA+credenital especially when it comes to good districts.\n\n2) First year teachers struggle with classroom management because they're creating a lot of lesson plans / units / curriculum from scratch.  It's very hard not to have down time as a first year teacher and the down time is what makes kids behaviors go sideways.  You're also trying to figure out what lessons have a high buy and and what lessons just flop from the jump.  All the routine, discapline and structure in the world isn't going to mean anything if you can't keep those kids meaningfully busy everyday.\n\n3) Department chairs and veteran teachers typically have the easiest classes.  New teachers are typically stuck with the remedial freshman who are bouncing off the walls.  My department chair taught 12th grade honors classes.  She was always heavily praised for how great her classroom management was, but her kids were all very well behaved and self motivated / college bound.  I think she was kind of oblivious to what our new guy was going through with his inclusion classes.\n\n4) Subbing isn't a good way to get in the door.  I've met a lot of credentialed subs who were passed over for contracted positions.  I also think long term subbing is a scam with all the work of teaching with half of the pay.\n\n5) Cellphones fried attention spans, but I think the real reason why there's so much apathy in teenagers nowadays is because school doesn't equal money anymore.  A lot of their parents and older siblings have student loan debts and are working low paying jobs.  Naturally they look at that and look at school as being outdated.\n\n6) Chatgpt and AI are going to get stronger and stronger in the next few years.  Every person I've met who works in tech is heavily confident that AI is going to completely change how we use the internet here very soon.  Google is 100 percent all in, and telling juniors and seniors to not use it is like telling them to take a horse and buggy to school instead of a car.\n\nI think there should be classes on how to use and navigate AI.  I spent the summer messing around with chat GPT and it's insanity on what it's capable of doing.  It can do a week's worth of graduate level research in 5 seconds with pinpoint accuracy.\n\n7) Coteaching doesn't work well.  It's usually one person doing all the lesson planning, teaching and grading while the other person sort of just sits there and maybe circulates here and there.  Ironically my coteacher was the most apahetic student I've had: always came in tardy, scrolled on his phone and dipped out a few minutes early.  I don't remember him actually teaching anything.  I felt resentful that he was getting paid the same salary I was without...really doing anything?  The weirdest thing was: I was struggling so much with this inclusion class that I complained to the head of the SPED department on the coteacher saying he wasn't helping and would just scroll all period.  She said \"Sounds like you need to learn how to motivate him more.\"  WHY THE FUCK IS IT MY JOB TO MOTIVATE A SALARIED THIRTY YEAR OLD?\n\n8) Some teachers are control freaks to an unhealthy level.  I'm unsure if this field attracts that personality type of if they become that way over time from this job.  I period subbed for this lady's government class during my prep.  I had a brainfart moment and told the kids to answer questions 1-4 when in reality she wanted them to answer 1-5.  I didn't notice until the bell rang.  She absolutely blew up my email the next school day acting like I commited a felony.  A piece of me wanted to tell her off, but I like not being fired.\n\n9) Mentor teachers should be paid to take on a student teacher.  I also think they should be trained on how to support a student teacher.  The lady I was placed with refused to give up any control at all and it was almost impossible to do the things I had to do for the TPA.  Those 4 months were absolutely stressful.\n\n10) The kids make or break this job.  If you work with good kids you connect with, teaching can be hillarious, fun, rewarding and even easy at times.  One year the kids were a total breeze and I truly felt like I was stealing money from this district since my job was so easy.  If the kids are blatanly disrespectful, resentful and rude...it's going to really hurt your mental health.  I put on 40 lbs last year dealing with all the stress. I always get nervous the day before a new school year knowing my fate is decided by the attendance sheet.\n\n11) Schools varry a lot.  There's several high schools in my community and they all seem like they have different vibes / cultures.  People always tell me admin creates the culture, but idk if that's true.  It's definitely very weid how one HS can be an uplifting and fun place while the one a few miles away feels like a prision.\n\n12) Teachers always say how much they love collobrating with other teachers, but everytime I ever asked for something my emails were left on read. I always thought it would be cool to collaborate and do projects with different departments, but I could never get anything to happen.  I kinda just gave up and became an antisocial island even though during the interview process they told me they don't like antisoical islands and like collobrating.\n\n13) I worked at a school with a 5 minute passing period.  The behaviors there were total shit.  I worked at a school with a 9 minute passing period, and the kids and staff seemed a lot less aggetated.  If I was admin, having a longer passing period would be the very first thing I would do for school culture.  Gives us all a breather to get ready for the next class, pee, greet students at the door, decompress / whatever.\n\nWhat are some things you think / noticed?",

He tried to justify it by saying, “Don’t be a mindless monkey,” implying not to do things thoughtlessly or perform tasks without purpose. But this really bothers me. I feel it carries racial undertones, especially since I’ve noticed he only uses this term with Black students—and there aren’t many of us in the program. Beyond that, he has bullied me relentlessly, intentionally calling me names that aren’t mine and making me feel generally uncomfortable. I was also told that his behavior might be influenced by his friend, a past instructor of mine, who doesn’t like me.  I escalated my current issue with the instructor to the director of the nursing program and the college administration, but they’ve done nothing except retaliate. The director told me that if something like this bothers me, I wouldn’t do well in nursing. They also warned me that pursuing this further could hurt my nursing career because of the college’s “good reputation.”  I’ve already moved forward with another strategy, but I’m looking for opinions. Am I wrong for not just letting this go?  For context, I have tangible proof of what happened, so I’m not worried about proving it—there’s no doubt he said it. On top of everything else, this same instructor got a student from a cohort ahead of me pregnant. She had the baby just before graduating, and they now live together. The director of the program was aware of this relationship and the student received special privileges that I felt were extremely unfair. ",

      "text": "We were hired about the same time; she was hired as a Senior with 7 YOE from household F500 companies with an impressive resume. We were originally on different projects, but  6 months after hiring, we were brought to the same team, under another developer for a project that is due this month. \n\nSince then, her only contribution has been to run stand-ups; basically scheduling weekly meetings and asking people what they do in the meetings. Worse still, she regularly misses those stand-ups, locking people out of meetings, and only to comes up with pathetic excuses like \"plumber at my door\" or \"sorry I lost track of time\" (she is fully WFH). Her technical expertise is a puddle, even for things she supposedly has years of experience in. For instance, not knowing how to use modern python dependencies manager (poetry/pdm/uv), or not being able to use Typescript for frontend development. Her PR reviews are outright atrocious: she commented that we shouldn't be committing .gitignore. I can't even say a positive thing about her work ethic either. She would take several weeks to fix a simple PR and generally do everything to avoid having to work. Image files too large to put on cloud? It's a blockage for this week. Upsampling the image to make it smaller? Nah she will just try again till the connection times out and report as a problem... \n\nWhen she was hired, she was supposed to be the most senior and our team lead. When the lead for our project resigned, I became the team lead since she was \"not familiar with our code\" enough, despite the project being developed from the ground up, when she and I joined the team. I assigned her a ticket in January, which is a simple \"serialise the data to a suitable format\" involving calling the equivalence of \\`df.to\\_csv\\`. That ticket has yet to be completed. \n\nAt first, I was not too unhappy, coming from a shittier workplace with a much worse pay. However, now that the deadline for the project is approaching, I am feeling much jaded from the whole experience. Basically 99% of the contribution comes from me: code design, implementation, CI/CD, testing, documentation, deployment. Her employment has been near 18 months and she has not written more than 100 lines of code. She is also fully WFH with at least 20% higher salary.\n\nShould I oust her to our director, or should I just look  for another job?",

She told me,”I hope you don’t stop doing this, you are very caring. We need more people here like you”. During my next rounding she talked to me about how she loves learning languages especially Spanish. I speak Spanish, so we talked a bit about that. Then she said she would love to move back to Texas to see her son and use the language because there’s a larger Spanish speaking community there. She said she really hopes to do that before her time on earth is over……….. when she said that my eyes watered immediately. I had to step outside and collect myself. Reality hit me like a ton of bricks and the stoic attitude I put on display completely shattered. I went to a vacant hallway and cried so no one could see me.

      "text": "In contrast to the vast number of posts which are basically either:\n\n* Announcing they are quitting\n* Complaining they can't get a job\n* Complaining they can't do their current job\n* \"I heard DE is dead.  Source: me.  Zero years experience in DE or any job for that matter. 25 years experience in TikTok.  I am 21 years old\"\n* Needing projects\n* Begging for \"tips\" how to pass the forbidden word which rhymes with schminterview (this one always gets a chuckle)\n* Also begging for \"tips\" on how to do their job (I put tips in inverted commas because what they want is a full blown solution to something they can't do)\n* AI generated posts (whilst I largely think the mods do a great job, the number of blatant AI posts in here is painful to read)\n\nI thought a nice change of pace was required.  So here it is - I'm a DE who is happy and is actually writing this post using my own brain.\n\nAbout me: I am self taught and have been a DE for just under 5 years ([proof](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/lmi2lg/from_a_beginner_to_beginners_from_printhello/)).  Spend most of my time doing quite interesting (to me) work where I have a data focussed, technical role building a data platform.  I earn a decent amount of money with which I'm happy with.\n\nMy work conditions are decent with an understanding and supportive manager.  Have to work weekends? Here's some very generous overtime.  Requested time off? No problem - go and enjoy your holiday and see you when you back with no questions asked.  They treat me like a person, I turn up every day and put in the extra work when they need me to.  Don't get me wrong, I'm the most cynical person ever although my last two managers have changed my mind completely.\n\nI dictate my own workload and have loads of freedom.  If something needs fixing, I will go ahead and fix it.  Opinions during technical discussions are always considered and rarely swatted away.  I get a lot of self satisfaction from turning out work and am a healthy mix of proud (when something is well built and works) and not so proud (something which really shouldn't exist but has to).  My job security is higher than most because I don't work in the US or in a high risk industry which means slightly less money although a lot less stress.\n\nRegularly get approached for new opportunities of both contract and FTE although have no plans on leaving any time soon because I like my current everything.  Yes, more money would be nice although the amount of \"arsehole pay\" I would need to cope working with, well, potential arseholes is quite high at the moment.\n\nBefore I get asked any predictable questions, some observations:\n\n* Most, if not all, people who have worked in IT and have never done another job are genuinely spoilt.  Much higher salaries, flexibility, and number of opportunities than most fields along with a lower barrier to entry, infinite learning resources, and possibility of building whatever you want from home with almost no restrictions.  My previous job required 4 years of education to get an actual entry level position, which is on-site only, and I was extremely lucky to have not needed a PhD. I got my first job in DE with £40-60 of courses and a used, crusty Dell Optiplex from Ebay.  The \"bad job market\" everybody is experiencing is probably better than most jobs best job market.\n* If you are using AI to fucking write REDDIT POSTS then you don't have imposter syndrome because you're a literal imposter.  If you don't even have the confidence to use your own words on a social media platform, then you should use this as an opportunity because arranging your thoughts or developing your communication style is something you clearly need practice with.  AI is making you worse to the point you are literally deferring what words you want to use to a computer.  Let that sink in for a sec how idiotic this is.  Yes, I am shaming you.\n* If you can't get a job and are instead reading this post, then seriously get off the internet and stick some time into getting better.  You don't need more courses.  You don't need guidance.  You don't need a fucking mentor.  You need discipline, motivation, and drive.  Real talk: if you find yourself giving up there are two choices.  You either take a break and find it within you to keep going or you can just do something else.\n* If you want to keep going: then keep going.  Somebody doing 10 hours a week and are \"talented\" will get outworked by the person doing 60+ hours a week who is \"average\". Time in the seat is a very important thing and there are no shortcuts for time spent learning.  The more time you spend learning new things and improving, the quicker you'll reach your goal.  What might take somebody 12 months might take you 6.  What might take you 6 somebody might learn in 3.  Ignore everybody else's journey and focus on yours.\n* If you want to stop: there's no shame in realising DE isn't for you.  There's no shame in realising ANY career isn't for you.  We're all good at something, friends.  Life doesn't always have to be a struggle.\n\nAMA\n\nEDIT: Jesus, already seeing AI replies.  If I suspect you are replying with an AI, you're giving me the permission to roast the fuck out of you.",

      "text": "Been in EMS for 9 years now and I am just sick of it. Came into EMS in my early 20s. I need to vent and guess I need advice on what the heck to do with my life. I have a degree in biology with 3 years of it being an ED tech for my certs.\n\nI don't mind patients at all. I love helping people as cliche as it sounds. In fact, this is the sole reason and will remain my reason for why I stayed in this career. Yes, there's been the frequent flyers, entitled ones, assholes, and everything in between. It's not bad considering you're only with them temporarily. Yet, I still give every one the same high quality care because they deserve it. Each patients get a full and fair patient assessment. Every patient is accomodated that best way I could make it work. If I can't, I'll just apologize and move on.\n\nIt's the culture of that I can't stand. I'm not trying to sound like a feminist, but I swear females get the crappy end of the stick. Granted, I understand this a male dominant field. \"Oh you missed an IV. Looks like you're not cut out to be a paramedic. Girls like you should just stick with being an EMT and drive, which sucks cause women can't drive\". (FUCK YOU Dave. I don't care. I wish I would have said something that day. I was livid.)\n\nI am small. I am 5'1 and 110lbs. But I feel like I get bullied because of my stature. The constant teasing, the constant butt end of the jokes. I was trying to restock my truck and the i-gels are at the top of the shelve. I am so short that I need a step stool. The supervisor says, \"Looks like this is a job for a tall man. Let me get this for you.\" I'm sure he meant no malicious intent from it, but I hear it all the time. Also, I was cheerleader in the past for years. I've helped throw people up in the air before and I still consistently weight lift. Lifting patients remind me of cheerleading where we need teamwork. Earlier this year, a firefighter pushed me away (not hard, but just enough to let me know to get out of the way) while I was holding the mega mover ready to move this patient to a stretcher.\n\nI am that stereotypical cheerleader where I have this bubbly, funny, high spirits (no pun intended lol), and charismatic nature. But this toxicity has turned me into a miserable person that I swore I never would become.\n\nMy washing machine broke one day and all I had was just old EMS uniforms, so I wore that. I wore a thong that day since I didn't have any clean underwear. My partner hit something under the ambulance, so we pulled over and I am bending over look to see if there were any damages. My shirt got untucked while looking and I didn't think anything of it. Then, one of my coworkers started being super friendly and flirty with me one day. I was confused. I told my partner about it and he laughed. I was still confused. Apparently, my partner snapped a picture of me bending over and you can clearly see that I was wearing a thong because my shirt was untucked. I felt so violated, so I went to the director. My partner got suspended for a week, but still worked there. To this day, I don't know how many people got that picture. I quit that agency a month afterwards because rumors got spread and I just got too embarrassed to work there.\n\nIt's the shitty partners, admins, nurses, and doctors that just make this job miserable. Granted I've had a significant fair share of wonderful colleagues and it makes the crappy low-paying job worth it.\n\nCool, thanks for the ROSC challenge coin. Cool, thanks for the delivering baby challenge coin. Omg another EMS shirt. Hey, the hospital just restocked chips and water in the EMS room. Collected a crap ton of coins that is just collecting dust. Oooo cool I got a paramedic of the year in 2022 and 2024. Yayyy. But, where is the pay? I started off making 14.50/hr as EMT in 2016 and 22.50 as a paramedic in 2019. Guess what I make now? A whopping $25.50. I don't care about rewards. I can't pay my bills with a challenge coin. (sorry if this sounded like I am listing accomplishments. I am more frustrated that they spend money on gifts rather than money.\n\nThe constant negativity from previous partners. Whether it's raging road rage, being mean to patients, or the micromanagers. I know my post sounds negative, but I guess I bottled it up for way too long. This makes me dread going into work everyday. When I have a great partner, I love love this job because it makes it more manageable. There were some partners where we were just incompatible after several weeks of trying to work it out, that's no problem. I've been constantly told to \"just deal with it\" by the supervisors when I wanted to just switch partners.\n\nWe get a lot of third rides and I've been an FTOing (lol) for 2 years now. I am very easy-going and supportive of every student I get. My biggest pet peave are those that don't want to learn and have a bad attitude or rudeness. I don't kick people off the ambulance, but I had this one student that had all the characteristics of a bad student/person. He had no business in EMS. I let him practice taking lead on a call and he was rude to this guy to the point where the patient said, \"Are you okay? Is everything okay with you?\" He said, \"Yes, you're being a pain in the rear.\" I understand the patient was being a PITA and the student did not curse, but stay professional. So I talked to the student at the of the call about my concerns, and he said, \"Well he's an idiot.\" I drove the student back to the station and signed off on his paperwork and told him to go home. He said, \"Pfft, whatever dude\".\n\nWhere do I move on from here? I am sorry about the long post.",

And then I found this job. Working on research vessels all over the world. I cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for a crew and staff of 40ish people. I have 2 support people. I work from 5am until 7pm with a two hour break in between. I've been to 40 countries. Snorkeled in Guam. Climbed a glacier in Alaska. Hiked a mountain in Hawaii. I work for 60 days and then have 30 days off. PAID. This summer I'm taking my family to Europe for 3 weeks. Sounds amazing right? You should try it. I want you to.\n\nNOAA's hiring freeze should (fingers crossed) be lifted on July 15. If you are good chef, good at cooking, training and planning then I'd like you to consider coming to work for NOAA. There are some requirements. You need a Merchant Mariners Credential (possibly being waived, NOAA will help you get in first year), a TWIC, a passport, your vaccinations and a basic safety course. It all takes time and about a $2000 investment. But I am telling you that this is an amazing job with excellent benefits. Health, Dental, Vision.

Real time with your family.\n\nI've attached a copy of my latest paycheck to verify what I am saying is reliable.  Sometimes you get laiud up at a dock or do repair yard work and then the pay isn't this good but it's still $3000 or so.\n\nMessage me if you are interested and we'll chat. If you are good at what you do then I'll help you with the process and introduce you to the hiring staff.\n\nLooking forward to hearing from you!",

      "title": "Some quick tips if you want to maximize income as a PA",
      "text": "I've worked in several specialties as a PA for over a decade. This is just a quick pointer for newer PAs given some of the \"compare job offer posts\" we've been getting lately, to help some of you guys steer away from these bogus 100-110 offers we are seeing lately. \n\n#####\n\nONE: Do your research. So, there is a huge variability in PA pay between cities, states, and specialties. While some cities are quite obviously over saturated (you can spot them because they're HCOL and the only job postings are family medicine and urgent care) and some places obviously will pay a lot (super rural, or inner city hospitals in states that aren't considered popular to live in), there is often LITTLE predictability in this. So do your research! Look up salary reports both APAA and whatever Google spits out. No it's not reliable but it's a starting point. Then look for recruiters in your job market, make an email account specific for this and don't give out your cell. Recruiters will often tell you salary ranges before you interview, so this is another way to learn the market. Ask other PAs you know in private some will share numbers. Finally, you can interview at spots and turn them down if you literally have no other way to get market insight. \n\n\n#####\n\nTWO: Apply broadly. If you aren't limited by geography, apply in cities that interest you. Look at cost of living, school districts, things to do. If you're willing to move, sky is the limit on salary. Even if not, apply broadly locally. Some major hospitals only post jobs on their career page but otherwise use indeed, Google jobs, doc cafe, zip recruiter as some places don't post universally. If you have connections use them cuz some positions don't get posted at all. Big hospitals have their own recruiters. Ask them what positions pay the best, if any are in critical need of a PA they often pay above market value for those positions. \n\n#####\n\nI've done multiple specialties and my advice is find the right schedule, pay, and group of people to work with and you can be happy. Don't pigeon hole yourself into one specialty. Every specialty has its pros and cons and anywhere you will learn stuff that transfers universally. Plus getting 1-2 subspecialties on your CV will make you a lot more attractive to employers. \n\n#####\n\nTHREE: go on multiple interviews. Grill potential employers on non financial details of the job like what's a typical day, how often are you out late, how many patients a day, do you get your own MA if it's clinic, how many PAs have they hired and what's the retention on them, etc. If you're forgetful write the info down once you get to your car. But DON'T talk money on an interview. If they ask what your last job paid just say you'd have to check to be sure etc. \n\n#####\n\nFOUR: try to get at least 3-4 offers. Ask every. single. one. if they negotiate. Most will. Make a document comparing all jobs. Convert PTO into a dollar amount. Write down major pros and cons of each job and rank them how bad you want them if money wasn't an issue. Write down red flags and commute time as well. \n\n#####\n\nIf they do negotiate, go to your highest offer, write that dollar amount down. Let's say 160K. Go back to the other employers and say \"I really want to take this job however I had another employer offer a more competitive financial package.\" They're gonna ask what it was. Add 10K or whatever to your best offer so let's say 170K and see what they counter with. \n\n#####\n\nIf they match it, you can maybe go even higher. Tell them you took that to the first employee (the one who offered you 160, which you claimed was 170), and now they offered you 180. See what happens. Keep pitting your offers against each other til they say no more. Then go back to your document and update the salary for everyone. \n\n#####\n\nFIVE: finally after all this, do not make your decision based on money alone. Go back to how you ranked the offers based on if they all paid equal. The best job may be in the middle, say number 2 for pay and 2 for what you want. Or maybe not. But at least this way you've got the best financial offers you can. \n\n#####\n\nSIX: don't take the literal first offer you get. A lot of employers take a month just to review your CV so have a little patience if no one is biting early on. If you're desperate for cash you can always do urgent care since they don't care (usually) about retention anyway. I say this maybe half jokingly. But regardless, if you do take one of these 110K jobs, every six months or so re evaluate the market. \n\n#####\n\nGood luck out there. Remember it is very difficult to become a PA. We offer a significant service unparalleled by most other professions in skill besides doctors and of course. We accept a lot of emotional baggage at work and huge liability. Don't sell yourself short and don't let yourself get taken advantage of. It's ok to take a low paying job if you want but at least make an effort not to unless you're already financially set because that extra money is going somewhere and it isn't patient pockets. ",

      "title": "I optimized my LinkedIn profile and got a job in 2 weeks (I'm a software dev).",
      "text": "Hello. Will try to save your time right away. The one-liner to take away from this post will be: If you’re struggling to get your next job in IT, then go and optimize your LinkedIn profile now. If this piece of advice sounds pretty obvious to you and you already know how to do it properly, then that’s it, you can skip the post :)\n\nI’m subscribed to multiple IT subreddits here related to software dev, DevOps, etc. 2-3 times a week, with pretty impressive stability, I see new posts about how dead the market is right now and how impossible it is to find a job even for experienced professionals. I just want to share my little story, in case it helps anyone. Even if it’s just a single person.\n\nI’m a software dev. Not junior, I have solid experience. I got into a big layoff wave and was looking for a new job. My biggest problem was that I’m currently located in LATAM, but was looking for EU/US-level salaries (I work only 100% remotely).\n\nLong story short. I thought the IT market was very bad right now (and realistically it is worse than 5 years ago, but it’s far from being dead). I had a LinkedIn profile, but I was receiving almost no messages from recruiters. I was applying from time to time to positions and my applications were usually automatically rejected.\n\nThen one day I was having a conversation with ChatGPT about my job search problem, the stability of the IT market, etc. And AI raised an important question: “Is your LinkedIn profile actually optimized for the next role that you’re looking for? Because if not, maybe the recruiters simply can’t find you, because you’re invisible to them.” The next thing I did (and I advise you to do the same) was provide ChatGPT my full dev experience description and ask for help to update my profile. I don’t fully know how it works under the hood of LinkedIn, but the update made my profile more visible to recruiters for the targeted keywords. So what I did is basically going through with ChatGPT section by section and updated:\n\n1. Headline (the most critical part). What I had before was something like: “Fullstack developer / DevOps.” It became: “Senior Node.js Engineer / Fullstack Developer (Typescript, React, DevOps, Cloud)” - it now contains keywords of technologies that I aim for right now in my next position.\n\n2. About section. It was very short. We changed it to something more informative and formatted: short opener (who I am and years of experience) + bullet-point highlights (my tech stack: backend, frontend, DevOps, cloud) + strong focus on impact (what I bring to the table, like scaling systems, leading projects, etc.) + in my case a note about 100% remote work.\n\n3. Experience. My role descriptions for previous jobs. Before, they were focused more on the tech I used in every position + my duties. I extended them with actual achievements in every project + optimized texts for stack keywords (Node.js, React, NestJS, Kubernetes, AWS, and other relevant ones).\n\n4. Skills. I had it almost empty before. So I added all relevant skills (tags). Btw, you can also order this section by putting the most important skills on top (recruiters usually won’t read the whole list). Ah, and another thing: endorsements. I opened profiles of my previous colleagues and endorsed their skills. They got notifications about it, and some of them did the same for me - I didn’t even have to ask explicitly.\n\n5. \"Featured\" section. In my case it’s empty, but you can put your personal website, GitHub profile, downloadable CV, etc.\n\n6. Banner. I had no banner until AI told me I could create one :D I added a calm gradient banner image. Very minor thing, probably no impact, but still cool.\n\n7. Open to work settings. Check if these settings are configured for the correct job type. In my case, it had ticks for onsite and hybrid work enabled, so I was receiving mismatched offers sometimes.\n\n8. Location. In my case it was okay/precise, but check yours.\n\n9. Small posts. This was the hardest part for me, because I’m usually too shy to post stuff, especially in a circle of ex-colleagues, friends, etc. If you have nothing to post about, it can be something neutral: a useful link to an article you liked (with a small comment), some actual news, a piece of advice, maybe even a post-question to the community, or some funny tech stuff. Whatever. The idea is to show LinkedIn’s internal algorithms that your profile is active.\n\nThe outcome: I now receive 1-4 messages from recruiters a day (usually 1–2), vs 1–3 messages per month. Also, these messages are more accurately matched with my profile (for example, before I could receive GoLang offers, even though my Go experience is very limited). As a bonus, I found my next position in 2 weeks after I made the change. I’m starting next month, day 1 (congratulations are welcomed :D).\n\nAdditional piece of advice: If you rely not just on recruiters contacting you but also apply yourself by sending CVs (including on LinkedIn), go through your CV with ChatGPT and optimize it for ATS. Today, most companies use ATS systems that will auto-reject your profile if ATS thinks you don’t match. You won’t even reach HR. Not sure how accurate this data is, but from what I found:\n\n* Big enterprises = 95%+ use an ATS.\n* Mid-sized companies = 70–80%.\n* Small companies = 30–50%.\n\nIf the company uses ATS, when you apply on LinkedIn (Apply or Easy Apply) it gets redirected into the ATS via integration. And ATS scans your CV and makes a decision. Same thing for applying through an external company website. AI helped me optimize my CV to have a good keyword density + still recruiter-friendly text + simple design that won’t confuse ATS systems.\n\nNot trying to advertise LinkedIn or ChatGPT, just sharing my experience which worked extremely well for me.",

(This sounds like an ad but I swear to god this study resource saved me 😭) \n*I used to used ChatGPT to generate these types of quizzes, but I noticed they pull sources from random places online &amp; the platform can’t handle the amount of content I try to upload ( like over 200 PowerPoint slides ). NotebookLM is better in my opinion because it generates it solely based off of the information you provide. \n\nMy school also uses evolve/sherpath so I would go in the Sherpath Ebook for my class and generate EAQ quizzes for the topic I was trying to master. I honestly think there were some questions on the HESI from those generated EAQ quizzes. \n\nPharmacology and fundamentals really went hand in hand with each other, and I noticed specifically with my Pharmacology HESI that it was heavily focused on nursing fundamental skills/processes .. but just adding some drugs lol. \n\nAlso in the pharmacology HESI they give you a lot of context clues where you just need to know the important/notable parts of the type of drug and drug class or what it does.. ik that sounds dumb but for the first pharmacology HESI I spent so much time trying to learn every detail about every single drug &amp; I just wasted a lot of time tbh.\n\nLike for example :\n\n“ Patient is taking warfarin to prevent the formation of blood clots. What should the patient avoid? “\nA. Sun exposure\nB. Dry shaving\nC. Eating chocolate\n\nIt says in the question that it’s used to prevent blood clots so the patient should minimize risk of cutting themselves (aka dry shaving) because they can bleed out 🙂 even without knowing warfarin was an anticoagulant I was able to use process of elimination. \n\n(Obviously not every question will be that straight forward but hopefully you get the point 😭) in my experience, less is more with pharmacology.\n\nThis is truly coming from a student that had no idea how to “study”. Some of my classmates would try to recommend YouTube videos to help understand concepts, but videos don’t do anything for me tbh. My personal learning style is repetition so the more i took these practice quizzes, the more it was beat into my head.  It was especially helpful pre-formatting questions to a HESI style so I already knew what question format to expect when it came to the actual exam.\n\n\nI hope some of this insight helped ! \n\n",

      "title": "Bipartisan bill Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act (H.R. 879) introduced to House to reverse 2.83% payment cuts while also granting payment adjustments for inflations, for a total positive adjustment of 6.62%",
      "text": "[https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/879](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/879)\n\nThe bipartisan bill [Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act (H.R. 879)](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/879?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%22hr+879%22%7D&amp;r=1&amp;s=4) was reintroduced in Congress to try and block the 2.83 percent Medicare pay cut physicians and actually increase the amount paid to cover inflationary costs.\n\nIf passed, this legislation would prospectively stop the 2.83% pay cut physicians received starting Jan. 1, 2025. The bill would be in effect from April 1 through Dec. 31, 2025. Compounded with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates of a projected 3.6% increase in practice cost expenses for this year due to inflation, physicians could face a 6.43% cut unless Congress acts. This bill looks to reverse the payment cuts while also granting payment adjustments for inflations, for a total positive adjustment of 6.62%.\n\nAccording to the [American Medical Association (AMA)](https://www.ama-assn.org/), when adjusted for inflation, Medicare reimbursement for physician services has declined 33% from 2001 to 2025. This has spurred loud outcry from all of the major U.S. medical associations. The AMA and many societies have predicted that Medicare reimbursement cuts for physicians are creating far-reaching consequences for the American healthcare system, particularly in rural and underserved areas.\n\nCosts for staffing and operations continue to climb, and declining reimbursement rates are forcing practices to make difficult decisions, such as layoffs, reduced services, or permanent closures. These closures are disproportionally impacting rural and lower-income areas. The AMA has said some physicians have already decided to no longer accept Medicare patients because the payments do not cover the costs for providing care.\n\nThis is also being compounded by a growing shortage of physicians and an aging population of doctors nearing retirement. These these cuts have exacerbated physician burnout and medical groups have said threaten to further limit access to care for Medicare patients.\n\nThe bipartisan bill was reintroduced Jan. 31 by [Congressmen Gregory F. Murphy, MD](https://murphy.house.gov/bio), (R-North Carolina) a urology and renal transplantation surgeon, along with 37 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle, including numerous physician members of the House.\n\n\"Physicians in America are facing unprecedented financial viability challenges due to continued Medicare cuts. Access to affordable and quality healthcare for millions of seniors is in severe jeopardy,\" said Congressman Murphy in a statement. \"Doctors see Medicare patients out of compassion, not for financial gain. The cost of caring for a Medicare patient far outpaces the reimbursement that physicians receive for seeing them. On top of that, the expense of providing care continues to rise due to medical inflation. This inflation, coupled with declining reimbursement rates, creates enormous financial pressures on physicians, forcing many to retire early, stop accepting new Medicare patients, or sell out to larger, consolidated hospital systems, private equity, or even insurance companies.\"\n\nMurphy said the future of private practice medicine is at stake. Policies such as Medicare awarding higher payments and inflationary increases to hospitals, but not to physicians, has led to a rapid decline in private practices. In cardiology for example, private practices employed about 90% of physicians, but that has eroded to about 12% today. He said private practices are the most cost-efficient and enable the most personalized care for patients. \"This bipartisan legislation prevents further cuts, provides a modest inflationary adjustment to help ease the cost of care, and ensures Medicare remains viable for both doctors and patients,\" Murphy said.\n\n\"Over the past 22 years, adjusting for inflation, physicians have essentially taken a 26% pay cut from Medicare,\" said [Congresswoman Kim Schrier, MD](https://schrier.house.gov/about), (D-Washington) a pediatrician, said in a statement. \"Their reimbursement has been flat or declining, while overhead costs have increased by about 47% for rent, labor, equipment and insurance. I cannot think of another profession whose compensation has dropped by 26% over two decades. Physicians have been holding their breath, year after year, hoping that Congress will act to avert these devastating decreases in reimbursement. Without adequate reimbursement, solo and small practice physicians—most often in rural or underserved areas—are already closing their doors.\"\n\n# March deadline approaches to reverse Medicare cuts\n\nThe AMA said the next legislative chance to reverse the Jan. 1 Medicare cuts comes in mid-March, which is the deadline for the 119th Congress to fund the federal government through the end of the fiscal year. At the end of 2024, The AMA said the 118th Congress passed a scaled-back resolution to keep the government running amid a very politically charged lame-duck session. The AMA said the language that would have stopped the physician Medicare payment cut was removed from the bill.\n\nThe [AMA said it strongly supports the legislation ](https://www.ama-assn.org/practice-management/medicare-medicaid/new-congress-same-legislative-focus-fix-medicare-now)and is working with members of Congress to meet that deadline. The group is also asking members to call their members of Congress in support of the bill, and to attend the \"Fix Medicare Now” event the AMA is hosting on Capitol Hill Feb. 11, where physicians are invited to wear their white coats.\n\n\"We are using this bill...to help position ourselves in the best possible way to be in that \\[March\\] package to reverse as much of the cuts as possible and to try to get an update,” explained [Jason Marino, AMA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-marino-525355173/) director of Congressional affairs said during a recent webinar. “We need to tell the story about the rural practice on the verge of closing because of these cuts. And they can’t afford to see Medicare patients. I’ve heard some stories from physicians that aren’t even taking a salary. They’re keeping the practice open by not taking a salary because the medical payments are going for their staff and technology. They’re not getting paid. But that’s not sustainable.”\n\n# Medical societies applaud effort to stop Medicare cuts\n\nMedical societies responded positively to the bill and said stopping payment cuts and keeping up with inflation would go a log way to improving Medicare patient care, rather than causing frustration and forcing doctors and health systems to make tough choices.\n\n\"The [Medical Group Management Association (MGMA)](https://www.mgma.com/) urges swift passage of the Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act of 2025. Physician practices are now a month into the new year, facing uncertainty and financial shortfalls from the congressional failure to reverse the 2025 Medicare fee schedule cuts,\" explained [Anders Gilberg, MGMA](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andersgilberg/) senior vice president, government affairs in a statement. \"These cuts have negatively impacted the viability of their Medicare business, commercial contracts tied to Medicare rates, as well as Medicaid reimbursement in states that use Medicare as a benchmark. With nearly 80% of all physicians now employed by facilities and larger entities, Medicare beneficiaries in areas of the country that rely solely on community-based medical practices are especially vulnerable to access issues. Without immediate congressional action on this important legislation, more and more physician practices will be forced to close their doors.”\n\n\"The [American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC)](https://www.asnc.org/) is urging Congress to take action, as declining reimbursement and the absence of inflationary updates pose grave challenges to physician practices,” said ASNC President [Panithaya Chareonthaitawee, MD](https://www.mayoclinic.org/biographies/chareonthaitawee-panithaya-m-d/bio-20053255), in a statement. “According to CMS, practice costs are projected to rise 3.5 percent this year. Physicians must have increased financial stability to continue providing care to patients.”\n\n# Physician members of Congress understand the impact of Medicare cuts\n\nThe concerns shared by the AMA, MGMA and other medical associations are being echoed by several congressional co-sponsors.\n\n\"The bipartisan Medicare Patient Access and Practice Stabilization Act is crucial to reversing the damaging trend of cuts that threaten our healthcare providers, especially in underserved communities. We must act now to prevent further early retirement, burnout and consolidation,\" said [Congresswoman Mariannette Miller-Meeks, MD](https://millermeeks.house.gov/about), (R-Iowa) an ophthalmologist, in a statement.\n\n\"Physicians, unlike the rest of the players in healthcare, have never received an inflationary update and consistently received cuts. This bill ensures a more stable Medicare payment system, allowing providers to focus on delivering care rather than worrying about losing their practice. With this bipartisan effort, we are working toward a system that supports both doctors and patients,\" said [Congressman Ami Bera, MD](https://bera.house.gov/about/), (D-California) a doctor of internal medicine and former health system administrator, in a statement.\n\n\"After yet another cut to the physician fee schedule, more physicians will be forced to limit the number of Medicare patients they see, or in some cases, shutter their doors. This will result in a lack of access to care for many Medicare beneficiaries. While the price to administer high-quality care has continued to rise over the last 20 years, the Medicare reimbursement rate for physicians has continued to drop,\" explained [Congressman John Joyce, MD](https://johnjoyce.house.gov/about), (R-Pennsylvania) a dermatologist, in a statement.\n\n\"Rising costs and administrative burdens make it clear that Medicare reimbursement policies must reflect the true costs of providing care,\" said [Congressman Raul Ruiz, MD](https://ruiz.house.gov/about/biography), (D-California) an an emergency room doctor, in a statement.\n\n[https://healthexec.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-policy/congressional-bill-could-reverse-medicare-cuts-and-increase-physician-pay](https://healthexec.com/topics/healthcare-management/healthcare-policy/congressional-bill-could-reverse-medicare-cuts-and-increase-physician-pay)",

It is where your training will continue best.\n\n3. There is no downtime at work. If you have a free moment then read on UpToDate about conditions your patients have.\n\n4. Find a mentor if you are not assigned one. That person should have high expectations for themself and others, lots of experience, and a passion for their job.\n\n5. When you refer a patient to a consultant, make the phone call and ask questions about the work up that will ensure. Learning from consultants is better than any book.\n\n6. In the hospital setting, go to procedures with your patients. Have a radiologist read your CT or plain film. Have a cardiologist review an echo with you.\n\n7. RNs are the frontline of healthcare. Healthcare does not exist without them. They are as much your teachers as are your colleague APPs and supervising physicians.\n\n8. It is always ok to say “I don’t know but I will go find the answer to your question.” No one came out of the womb knowing medicine. It is not weakness to ask for help. It is a strength.\n\n9.

It’s hard. \n\nToday was my third time in 19 months that I had to step out and take a walk. The quick version is, we have a client who was sickly, particularly with diabetes. The client had an injury that caused amputations, so it was a decent sized case. Defense settled out of court for a large 6 figure sum. The problem here is the client’s treatment was through the VA. And I don’t know if anyone has experience in trying to get a VA lien, but the process is ENDLESS. \n\nIt took exactly 10 months to get the lien. From\nOctober through January, my client and their spouse were living out of their car, just hoping and waiting for their settlement. They called me every day. And not in an annoying “I want my money” way. They were always so kind, so pleasant. But my client was always so sick. I wanted to help them badly but waiting on the VA lien tied my hands. In that time, they called me crying pretty often. It was heartbreaking. \n\nI finally was able to make the call in January. WE GOT THE LIEN! They were so happy. I expedited the entire process to get them their check. It was a victory moment not just for them, but for me too. I didn’t live through their struggles but I was sympathetic to my daily conversations with them. They are good people who deserved a place to sleep at night. \n\nToday, one month after I sent them their settlement money, my client’s spouse called me to tell me our client passed away this past weekend. I am devastated. Our client spent the last few months of life struggling to survive (and I don’t mean the illnesses) and when they finally get the means to have a sustainable life, our client died. \n\nMy heart is absolutely broken for the both of them. Our client wasn’t elderly, but she was sickly. I know how to put a wall up, and prevent myself from being emotionally invested in clients, but this one really hurts. \n\nThanks for letting me get this out. ",

      "text": "There's a lot of negativity floating around here, some of it justified, some super exaggerated, but I want to share a different viewpoint, especially for anyone thinking about OT as a profession or struggling in their current setting.\n\nPracticing as an OT is genuinely rewarding. Every day, you have the incredible opportunity to positively and directly influence someone's life. Whether it's helping them regain their independence, assisting them in activities they deeply love and miss, or simply being there as a caring human being. The relationships you form with your clients are deeply meaningful, and every time I have one of those magical moments of my client being excited to see me, all the hard work becomes worth it.\n\nSure, by the end of the day, I'm totally and completely mentally and physically exhausted and often find myself heading to bed earlier than usual. But the important part is this: I never dread waking up in the morning to go to work. I just dread the times I have to take documentation home with me lol. I genuinely enjoy my time spent working with clients, and the days go by incredibly fast.\n\nI get why there's plenty of venting here because our field, as does any field, has its cons, and these can sometimes overshadow all the positives. However, I wanted to share my experience and reassure anyone on the fence: being an occupational therapist can be an exceptionally fulfilling career when you're pursuing it for the right reasons.",

      "title": "I loved my nursing school experience! 🎓",
      "text": "I've officially graduated from my 12 month ABSN! I earned a 3.87 GPA, made the Dean's list, and graduated summa cum laude. I got all As in patho and pharm. I'm getting ready for the NCLEX now, and I'll be starting as a new grad in the ICU this summer.\n\nBefore I started nursing school, I spent a lot of time reading and watching videos about other people's nursing school experiences. A lot of people were really having a bad time! I don't want to discount their feelings, because their experiences may have been pretty different from mine. \n\nHowever, I did want to make a more positive post for anyone who might benefit!\n\n**Backstory (feel free to skip)**\n\nMy path to actually starting nursing school was a little rocky. I started taking my prereqs in Fall 2021 while also working full-time at a non-profit. I *loved* Anatomy and Physiology! I got a 94.7% on my TEAS in November 2021 and finished A+P 2 in Spring 2022. \n\nI applied to the ADN nursing program at my community college, as well as the ABSN program that I ultimately ended up attending. I was waitlisted for the ABSN (likely because I hadn't finished all my prereqs at the time), but was accepted to the ADN program for Fall 2022. \n\nFor personal reasons, I ended up declining my acceptance to that program. I kept working, waffling on whether I wanted to go to nursing school or not, and ultimately reapplied to the ABSN program for Summer 2023. This time, I was accepted, despite having one English class left to complete. \n\nI quit my terrible job and moved to be closer to the school. At the time I was very frazzled and honestly kind of depressed, and terrified that those things would lead to me failing out of the program. \n\nUltimately, I ended up having to delay for a year because I wasn't able to complete my one English class in time. 😑 \n\nThis actually ended up being an enormous blessing in disguise. I stayed in the area and ended up working as a tech on an inpatient psych unit at one of the local hospitals. \n\nI discovered that I loved the work, but more important, wound up being part of a fantastic team. I realized that I had internalized some things at my last job that reflected more about that specific, toxic workplace than they reflected about me as a person. \n\nI became more and more confident every day. I wasn't frazzled anymore. Not depressed. I learned how to communicate empathetically with patients, even in uncomfortable situations. I juggled tasks effectively even when the floor was chaotic. A nurse coworker once called me a \"supertech.\" It made me feel so much more prepared for nursing school than I would have been otherwise.\n\nThis isn't really important to know, but I wanted to include this backstory as reassurance for anyone whose path to/through nursing school doesn't end up being straightforward because of whatever obstacles you might face. In hindsight, I wouldn't have wanted things to go any other way.\n\n**Starting nursing school**\n\nI started my program in summer 2024 at age 30. I was very scared and definitely a little overwhelmed. I worried that I would fail, or, worse, that I would hurt someone in the process. I didn't really click with the other students in my cohort.\n\nMy program was \"front-loaded,\" meaning that the summer and fall terms were the most intense. We had at least one exam every week over the summer, sometimes even more. \n\nFor the first five weeks or so, I felt panicked every day. I was getting good grades in my classes and passing my check-offs, but I was very stressed. I had to [excuse myself from class](https://www.reddit.com/r/StudentNurse/comments/1d5rsbz/just_finished_my_first_week_and_ive_already_cried/) when we first learned dosage calculations so I could hide in the bathroom and cry. I left every exam convinced that I had bombed it. \n\nAfter the first month or so, a weird thing happened: I started to feel kind of okay again! \n\n**Surviving nursing school**\n\nThings didn't really get easy after that, but they did get easi*er*. I eventually stopped panicking after every exam. I started to feel a little more competent and a little more confident. \n\nI was tired as fuck – at the height of the program, we had clinical 4 days a week, and I was still working PRN on the psych floor. But, believe it or not, I was often having a good time. I loved clinical: learning new things, trying out skills, being able to help and talk to patients. I passed all my check-offs, stressful as they were. \n\nI hated sim. That part never got better, lol. \n\nA few cool miscellaneous things that happened: \n\n* In my first clinical rotation, my partner and I noticed that our nursing home resident had adventitious lung sounds (crackles) and reported it to our instructor and the nurse. She got evaluated by the SNF's nurse practitioner and it turns out we caught an early case of pneumonia!\n* I held a baby for the first time! (Even better, my instructor was surprised to learn I didn't have experience with babies!)\n* I got a $5,000 merit scholarship from the school (funded by a large corporation)!\n* I saw someone get born!!\n* Most of the patients I worked with were wonderful and kind, and often very happy to support my/our learning\n* I did pretty well on the ATI NCLEX predictor exam without extra studying (my program encourages us to take it \"cold\" to establish a baseline). I did get every single question on professionalism wrong somehowbut that's okay\n* Overall got really positive feedback from my instructors, including my favorite compliment: \"You care, and that's something I can't teach you.\"\n\n**Surviving capstone**\n\nI did not get the kind of unit I wanted for capstone. I was so sad! In the end, my unit wound up being exactly the right place for me. I had a preceptor who was an excellent teacher with a great sense of humor, and even clicked with some of the floor staff (I am quiet/reserved so this is big for me). \n\nEvery day got a little easier, and by the end, I felt so much more prepared for the future. I got offered a job on the floor more than once (and might have taken it if I lived closer!). \n\nOverall, it had its ups and downs, but it was a really great learning experience.\n\n**TL;DR**\n\nNursing school was probably the hardest thing I've ever done. To be honest, it felt like a transformative experience for me as a person, and I feel like I've grown so much over the last year. \n\nI do think to some extent I got lucky – my school didn't have a bullying issue in our cohort, and the staff were so supportive. So I dodged two of the biggest issues that people seem to face. \n\nI'm so fucking scared to start in the ICU – but I'm also really, really excited for what the future holds. I'm glad I went for it, and I'm so happy to almost be a real nurse. \n\nThis sub was also honestly a really wonderful support for me through the whole process – thank you!\n\n**Advice for prenursing students**\n\n* Get healthcare experience if you can. People with CNA/nursing assistant/patient care tech experience were noticeably more comfortable and adept with hands on skills, especially toward the beginning of the program. EMTs to some extent as well. \n*  For A+P: understand the big concepts first, then memorize the details. I highly recommend flashcards – I used [Anki](https://ankiweb.net) extensively in A+P/microbiology and then again in my nursing classes. I really like the spaced repetition features, but it does have more of a learning curve than Quizlet. \n* With Anki, you can make flashcards with images from your lab manual or lecture slides. Really great for memorizing structures, bones, muscles, etc. \n* Make your own flashcards. It forces you to review the material, consider what's important to know, etc. \n* Do *not* cram last minute for A+P and then forget everything. It will absolutely come back to bite you in the ass in patho and pharm.\n* Research the programs you're considering and ask the hard questions. I went to our admitted students event and asked some pointed questions about the culture and what the faculty were like. I would also highly recommend finding out the attrition rates *and* NCLEX pass rates – you don't want a program where a lot of people fail the NCLEX, and you also don't want a program with high NCLEX pass rates because they yeet everyone at the first sign of struggle.\n* I listened to the [Straight A nursing podcast](https://straightanursingstudent.com/podcast/) a lot when I was a prenursing student. The NCLEX/disease-specific episodes might not be as helpful before you're in nursing school, but Nurse Mo has some great episodes in there for prenursing students as well.\n* Find systems that work well for you NOW. You don't want to be trying to figure it out after you start nursing school. This includes study systems and also planners. I personally ended up using my phone calendar and Notes app because they sync to my laptop (RIP to the beautiful paper planners I bought but they weren't efficient for me).\n* Deep clean your house before nursing school starts. I post this all the time but I'm so serious about this. You won't have time or energy for much more than basic upkeep, if that. \n* You are not too old to go to nursing school!\n\n**Advice for nursing school**\n\n* Try to learn or do something new every single clinical day. A nursing student told me this before I started and it was really good advice for me.\n* Jump on every single learning opportunity that comes your way. **If your instructor asks you if you want to see/try something, the correct answer is yes.** Nurses are more likely to go out of their way to offer you opportunities if they can tell you're eager to learn, and it's a great way to make an impression on instructors who might be job references down the road. I'm like 98% sure that I got my job in the ICU because a specific instructor thought highly of me. \n* Try to take a sincere interest in everything that comes your way, even if you're not planning on going into that kind of nursing. I went in thinking I was going to be a psych nurse, and I'm glad I didn't limit myself by acting like anything else was unimportant. You never know.\n* The way my school taught dosage calculations was really confusing for me. I ended up using Nurse Mo's [Confident Calculations course](https://learn.straightanursingstudent.com/confident-calculations) and it made a huge difference for me. Would recommend.\n* I would actually die for Sarah [RegisteredNurseRN](https://www.youtube.com/user/RegisteredNurseRN/).\n* If you can, find a nurse mentor or a friend or SOMEONE who's been there. My nurse friend has been like 85% of my sanity. \n* Keep a \"wins list.\" This idea came from my nurse friend and it was brilliant. Anything good that happens goes in the wins list so you can remember later. Good grades? Good instructor feedback? Patient said something really nice to you? Made it through sim without craving the sweet freedom of death? Into the wins list it goes. Mine has ended up being a really lovely narrative following my nursing school journey and I'm so glad I have it.\n* I'm a really heavy sleeper and I can turn off alarms without actually waking up. Bad combination. This [shock watch](https://www.amazon.com/Pavlok-Shock-Clock-Customizable-App-Controlled/dp/B0BGYY45DY) saved my ass for real.\n* Communicate with your faculty and instructors. If you're struggling, it's way better to reach out for help sooner rather than later. \n* If you can, advocate for your learning. If there's something you really want to see or work on, letting your instructor or nurse know can really help them find you opportunities.\n* Ask questions! Especially in clinical.\n* Be patient with yourself. Try to give yourself grace. \n\nAnd with that, I'm officially changing my flair. Thank you for reading! ",

      "title": "As a new grad RN, here is some advice that I learned while being in school",
      "text": "1. Learn when to ask for help.\n\nDuring school, I worked full time at a restaurant because I was trying to keep up with my bills. Luckily I split the bills with my gf so it was easier on me. I hate asking for help from anyone but I finally mid way through schooling asking for my parents to help us with some of my rent so I wouldn't have to work as many shifts in a row. This saved me some time to spend my weekdays studying after school. Don't be afraid to ask for help, the worst thing that can happen is they say no.\n\n2. Study smarter not harder\n\nI used to be a C student when I was in highschool but years later I was making As and Bs in nursing school because I changed my mindset and the way that I study completely. I figured out my learning style which a little mix of everything. I would not use my textbook unless something very specific was repeated in lecture to highlight in our textbook or PowerPoint (some charts or a specific concept). I would watch YouTube videos from levelupRN and registered nurse Sarah online and take their quizzes linked in the videos. I would write out notes while I watched the videos and replay certain parts if I didn't understand something. I did all my flashcards using quizlet or would find some that match our content in class. We used ATI so I mainly read through the ATI books that they gave us and did questions online (a lot of questions) and made sure to write out the explanations on the ones I got wrong and try to rationalize out loud why it was wrong compared to the right answer. I would not study for hours, I studied for about 2 hours a day and took a lot of breaks. Sometimes I studied a few more hours if I really was lost on something but I mainly watched a bunch of content about a subject even while I was eating dinner. Over studying would just numb my brain and lead to burnout. \n\n3. Anxiety is the worst and is a theif of good self-esteem\n\nI had a very difficult time adjusting to the environment of nursing school and especially clinicals because I was always afraid I would harm someone or make a huge mistake. It didn't help that my first clinical instructor was extremely strict about every little thing and yelled at us multiple times over things out of our control. My advice is wake up very early for class/clinical and adjust yourself to the day. Make a coffee, watch some TV, and just relax before you go. Be at clinical 30 mins before so you can mentally prepare yourself and review what you need to review. Listen to music on the way there if it calms you. As a student, you know nothing and that is completely okay and even the nurses and everyone else know that you know nothing as well. That is fine, you are there to LEARN and do what you need to do to pass. No one is expecting you to do every IV known to man and chart as though you've done the job for 20+ yrs. If you need help or have a question, always ask the nurse or tour instructor if you are comfortable with them.\n\n4. The NCLEX is not a hard test.\n\nIf you are studying for the NCLEX right now, stop thinking that you need an everyday of the week 5 to 6 hr Study plan to pass. You don't. You just don't need that at all. I used Archer and did readiness assessments every single day and only focused on the easy and medium questions mainly. The NCLEX just wants to know if you know what everyone else knows. It doesn't care if you know the most complex questions. If I needed a refresher on a concept, I listened to the Mark K lectures on spotify and took notes. Don't forget that if you are like me and need absolute silence when taking your NCLEX, not only will they offer noise canceling headphones but they have actual earplugs that you can request as well!\n\n5. Passing nursing school is all about your mindset\n\nI would constantly tell myself things like hey if you made it through A&amp;P then surely you can make it through your TEAS test, if you can make it through that then your can make it through Fundementals and etc. If I had 2 careplans due the next morning and I only had my nurse notes done then I would just get started and think that it would be okay because once I get this done I will feel more prepared and if I can't complete something then I'll wake up early and finish it to the best of my ability. Don't overstress yourself and try to pull an all nighter to finish something because you need to rest while you can.",

I was discouraged by this and even more, by my background and lack of modern systems experience.

      "title": "AAPA salary report is a leash keeping PAs humble since... forever?",
      "text": "The PA Salary Report is that ex you still text even though he wrecked your car, stole your dog, and somehow still has the nerve to send you a \"you up?\" at 11:47 PM.\n\nI’ve been a PA for 3 years and at this point, I’m convinced AAPA report is ruining our lives. \n\nHear me out....its ruining us not in some abstract way. It's screwing us in real life, In our bank accounts, tax bracket where you remain to be making just enough to get no help but not enough to ever afford more help.\n\nMy first job paid 125K. I was fresh out of school. It felt good. wRVU bonus sprinkled on top...I thought I was on my way to greatness. Year two rolls around... still 125K. Bonus? Vanished! Ghosted! When I asked, they blinked like I’d just told them I wanted to start doing surgeries...“You’re already in the upper tier of PA salaries” they told me.\n\nUpper tier? Bruh, I drive a car that needs prayer, patience, and a floor tap to turn on AC when I need it...which is every single day in Texas!\n\nShockingly (not really) every single clinic I’ve interviewed at since says the exact same thing! The moment I mention I want “135K base and a quarterly bonus,” you can see them glitching! Their pupils blow up like they just spotted a chart with no vitals... PA Salary Report has opened in their head like a mental CT scan..w and w/o oral contrast! They smirk at my audacity before they start putting me back in my place\n\nI can hear their inner monologue:  \n“LOL at your AUDACITY, you peasant!!! HOW DARE YOU! You… little stethoscope-wielding gremlin. You thought your value goes up with experience, just 3 yr of experience? Have you not seen those before you, the ones with 5+ years of experience sitting gratefully at 125k...YOU Fool. You are not here to grow. You are here to pre-chart, over-chart, re-chart and keep charting to cross that milli, turn it into a billi, do more refill fluconazole, and die quietly at your desk…and while dying, make sure you remind yourself how lucky you are to be making 3 figures right out of PA school! You’re not the captain of the ship. You are the The Groom of the Stool... The one who empties the urine bucket wipes captain/king after he takes a dump..you are important to a degree just like THE GROOM OF THE STOOL is/was (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groom\\_of\\_the\\_Stool)\n\nThe AAPA report was supposed to help us. Instead, it gave every clinic owner and admin a number to weaponize. It’s not a benchmark anymore. It’s a trap. You hit that number, and suddenly asking for a raise feels like demanding Jeff Bezos’ yacht.\n\nAnd you know who isn’t living like this?  \nDerm PAs. The chosen ones. They escaped. They have their own subreddit now. They’re getting paid for productivity, procedures, lasers, fillers, botox, maybe even inner peace because of financial security. Good for them. They figured it out.\n\nOver here, someone with eight years of experience is clapping for 140K like they just got a full ride to Harvard. That’s not okay. If you're ten years in, doing specialty work, managing patients, and still showing up with clean scrubs and semi-functioning eye contact, you should be making more than a derm shave biopsy every 10 minutes.\n\nAs a new grad, I wanted to “do real medicine” but then real bills happened. Now I’m not poor enough for food stamps and not rich enough to buy a new HONDA Civic without another loan. I hate loans…I don’t want more loans… right now I'm just stuck in the middle, watching my student loans age like fine wine.\n\nFew months back when I was low key job hunting, didn't put my resignation yet- I met a PA who had slithered his way to become a manager. He offered me a position: 15 solo night shifts a month (how generous), 12hr each, No PTO, MD available \"by phone.\"...Pay? 140K and that already included night differential.  After this amazing offer, with dead eyes of someone whose soul left during managerial training, he says,  \n“We’re hoping you’ll pick up extra night shifts and you will remain nights for at-least 1 year”\n\nSir… you are not a manager.  \nYou are a marrow suppression event.\n\nAnd of course he closed with the sacred line every trash offer comes with:  \n“That’s not the usual salary for someone with two years out”\n\nNo. Just no.\n\nBurn that line. Burn the report. Burn the spreadsheet.  \nIf AAPA doesn’t lock that report or burn it and then flush it down the toilet, we’re all gonna be trapped in hellish time loop where every day is Monday, the coffee machine is broken, and the pt wants abx “just in case.” for his viral infx\n\n**P.S.** I know some pre-PAs and PA students are lurking here as I once did, scrolling reddit posts thinking,  \n“OMG what is wrong with this PA… she is soooo ungrateful. 125K?? That’s AHHMAZING! I’d cry tears of joy for that.”\n\nAnd I get it. I really do. I was you. But here’s what u don’t know…\n\nWhen that 125K doesn’t move after 3 years. When you’ve maxed out your learning curve in your field… When your schedule is full, the collection reports keep climbing to milli, and instead of a raise or even a gift card, they hire two more NPs to triple the clinic income while you just... keep swimming?\n\nYou realize something dark, u have officially maxed out, not because you’re not growing, but because the AAPA salary Report told them so.\n\nAnd when financial stagnation hits...It’s a whole new flavor of existential dread because your raise this year was emotional resilience.\n\nIf I were 60yr old, maybe I’d shrug it off. Retirement’s around the corner. But I’m not. I still have to buy a house, pay off loans, maybe own a car that doesn’t start with prayer ;) …\n\nAnyway, to the students, yes 125K is amazing on year 0  \nUntil it isn’t \n\nGood luck out there",

      "text": "Guys, I'm here sitting on my back yard on a beautiful Saturday and I am about to sign an offer letter with a Fortune 500 company — with a 25% salary increase.\n\nBut just a few months ago, I was getting rejected from interviews that didn’t even last 10 minutes. I was so embarrassed on how bad I did on the interviews. With over a decade in IT — supporting Windows and Linux systems, solving tough problems, and holding a high-level security clearance — I thought I had a solid foundation. But in the world of DevOps, I kept hearing the same message:\n\n“You don’t have enough experience.”\n\n“You’re not worth senior-level DevOps pay.”\n\nAnd ironically, being a high earner already seemed to work \\*against\\* me.\n\nI was turned down from at least eight interviews. Some didn’t even give me a chance to speak. I started doubting myself — hard.\n\nSo when another recruiter reached out, I told her:\n\n\"I don’t want to waste your team’s time. My background might not align.\"\n\nShe said:\n\n\"Actually, we really like what we see. Let’s get you in front of the hiring manager.\"\\_\n\nAfter the first interview with the \\*\\*hiring manager\\*\\*, I asked for \\*\\*two weeks\\*\\* to prepare for the technical round — not to delay, but because I was \\*determined\\* not to fail again.\n\nAt that point, I didn’t even have a home lab. But I went all in.\n\nIn those two weeks:\n\n\\- Built a full homelab from scratch\n\n\\- Deployed the Sock Shop app using ArgoCD\n\n\\- Provisioned infrastructure with Terraform\n\n\\- Set up monitoring with \\*\\*Prometheus, Grafana, and Kuberhealthy\\*\\*\n\n\\- Studied nonstop for a HackerRank I had never heard of\n\n\\- \\*\\*Watched DevOps interview Q&amp;A videos on YouTube while driving — even while taking my dog to the vet\\*\\*\n\n\\- \\*\\*Skipped volleyball — something I love — and turned down social invites from friends just to stay locked in\\*\\*\n\nThe \\*\\*technical interview was round 2 of 4\\*\\*, but after one hour of walking through my setup, architecture, and decisions — they said:\n\n\"We’re skipping the rest. We're making you an offer.\"\\_\n\nThat moment changed everything.\n\n\\*\\*My clearance didn’t get me here. My title didn’t. My past salary didn’t.\\*\\*\n\nBut \\*grit, sacrifice, and proof of ability\\* did.\n\nAnd the cherry on top? I’ll get to \\*\\*work from home eventually\\*\\* — a goal I’ve had for years.\n\nTo anyone trying to break into DevOps:\n\nDon’t wait until you’re “ready.”\n\n\\*\\*Start building, start learning, and never stop showing up.\\*\\*\n\nYour breakthrough might be closer than you think.\n\nSorry English isn't my first language and I use ChatGPT to help me with this but it's truly my experience.

However the details of it seem bizarre to me and I am wonder if this is how other places have implemented the policy too. \n\nSo the basis is 4 days a week any monday thursday or friday can be taken off. The expectation is you'll work 32 hrs a week, but be as productive with the expectation that you will also become more productive (which makes sense, this is the whole point of these programs) However, you will lose also 20% of your salary and time off accrual for sick, vacation and personal days. The trial is 1 year so once you start youre also stuck for the year.\n\nSo to me this seems like they want more work done in less time for less pay??? \n\nAm I crazy or does this not defeat the entire purpose of implementing this policy? Its supposed to provide better balance and mental health, but this seem so counterinitiative. \n\n  \nWould love to hear from other devs who have had a chance in a 4-day work week environment, how did your org implement it? Did it stay? Did it work for you?",

I hit 2 years yesterday and I remember how terrible my trainer was. Some stuff you learn as you go, backing being one of them but this is a dangerous job and the last thing a trainee needs is to feel as though they’re being rushed to learn how to handle the vehicle.

I was laid off ~1.5 months ago from my previous firm and worked with a specialized headhunter who focuses on placing prop trading SW and FPGA engineers. I didn't personally submit any applications—everything was handled by my HH. We applied to eight firms/quant funds in a targeted fashion. My HH's relationship with certain firms allowed me to bypass a few bureaucratic HR stages and get in front of hiring managers immediately.\n\nThis was my first time on the market as a Senior and my interview experience mostly aligned with how I chose to prepare. The mix of questions I encountered was roughly 9:1 domain-specific C++ to LeetCode-style DSA. There were a bunch of questions on deep C++ features, trading-specific minutiae (exchange protocols, executing a low latency strategy on a particular exchange), lock-free algo knowledge, etc. Ironically, the rounds that tripped me up the most _were_ LeetCode-style questions, so I regret not doing more than the 10-15 questions I practiced but overall my preparation was accurate.\n\nI withdrew from the interview process at three firms since I received a solid offer from a firm I liked (on a desk/team I liked as well). I anticipate I would've gotten another 1-2 offers had I seen those through to the end but I was satisfied.\n\n* Timeline from start of search to offer: 1 month\n* TC: ~$500K\n* Location: Chicago\n* Preparation: 10-15 LeetCode questions and implementing dozens of lock-free/high-performance data structures in C++. Reading a few intermediate to advanced C++ books to refresh (think Nicolai Josuttis, et al.). Playing around with some language features in the newer standards (C++23/26).",

      "text": "Third day.\n\nWhen I arrived today, I was mentally prepared for the tortellini, so I reported myself to the sous chef for assignments and asked if I should start with them—but he said not today. Apparently, I made enough for the week, so the tortellini will have to wait.\n\nI started with peeling some cucumbers, and then he showed me how to dice them into pretty fine cubes. I diced them all, and then he showed me how to marinate them. After that, we blanched some cherry tomatoes for tomato mayonnaise and marinated a few big ones for tomato vinaigrette.\n\nThen we had lunch, and service started.\n\nDuring service, I had a bit of autonomy. I was making amuse-bouche and desserts and helping the other two chefs with plating. When the service ended, me and the sous chef baked some biscuit cakes and made crème for them. After that, we had a short break.\n\nWhen we started working again in the evening, the chef taught me how to make “boats” out of potatoes. The inside had to be a perfect 8 cm, and the total weight had to be between 60–65 grams. I broke a few, but it was my first time. All the waste is going to be used to make potato purée, which is what fills the boats later. They took me a really long time, and I had to stop making them when the service started and go back to preparing amuse-bouche.\n\nThe service was once again great, and we had a new reinforcement from a mini-jobber who used to work in other Michelin restaurants.\n\nWhat struck me most today is when I was making amuse-bouche and couldn’t find the Parmigiano. I started to look for it, and one of the chefs came to me with it and told me:\n“You are not alone. We must work together and together we are strong.”\nThis really hit me, because I used to work in a really toxic environment where every man was for himself and everyone had an ego as big as the Empire State Building. So I was shocked—and I mean it in a good way.\n\nWhen there was just one table left, the sous chef asked me if I could decorate the cake and told me to use anything I find, but to remember that the star is in everybody’s hands, not just the chef’s. I made it—it’s not the best of the best, but I don’t think it’s super bad for the first time. The sous chef said it’s good and sent it out.\n\nAfter that, we cleaned and went home.\n\nNow I just want to say this:\n1. Sorry for not replying actively.\nI need to concentrate on the job, so I’ll usually reply later.\n\n2. Why I write all of this.\nI spent 5 years in a really toxic place. I love food, I love the process, but I said to myself: I will travel into the world for 2 months, and if I learn something, I’m going to stick to this job. But if I don’t—maybe it’s better to leave now.\nTo explain: I got abused by my coworkers and the chef. Once, after 25 straight days at work—doing breakfast every morning and finishing at 23:00—I was tired and burned my foot. The chef saw it and said I needed to finish the service or I wouldn’t get paid my monthly salary. I finally stood up to him and said, “Fine, we’ll see each other in court,” and he left the kitchen during a busy dinner service.\nIt was up to me to either go to the hospital or help my coworkers—so I stayed, like an idiot, jumping on one foot in constant pain, and managed sauté.\nAfter that crazy day, I went to the hospital. The burn was bad and they insisted on sick leave, but I went to work anyway. I had to go every two days to get the bandage changed so it wouldn’t get infected. The chef told me I had to do breakfast that day, and I said no, I need to care for my foot. He took me by the neck, bashed my back over the kitchen counter, and said, “You think you’re special that you don’t have to do breakfast?”\nAfter that, it all spiraled down.\nThe burn is still there. I still have problems with small movements in that foot, in case anyone thinks it was probably just a small burn.\n\n3. To all chefs out there:\nPlease treat your cooks with respect. We are trying. We are working just like you. We don’t deserve to be treated like trash from the streets.\n\nThe image is of the cake I made this evening.\n\nThank you for reading this and for all your support and tips—I really appreciate it.",

      "text": "Hi everyone,\n\nI'm the opinion editor at STAT, the health/medicine publication owned by the Boston Globe. I've been reading this sub for quite some time now and have long wanted to publish an essay from a chain pharmacist about the difficult environment at the moment. \n\nIt finally happened last week, when I published a [fantastic op-ed](https://www.statnews.com/2025/12/12/pharmacists-crisis-union-patient-safety/) by a pharmacist at a (unionized) CVS in Rhode Island. He writes:\n\n&gt;Anyone who has visited a chain retail pharmacy knows that we are understaffed. It becomes obvious as patients stand in a long line, watching one of the few technicians waiting for the pharmacist to finish verifying an order before they can help the next customer. That pharmacist has a phone to one ear and is helping another technician with an antibiotic to be mixed for a sick child at the drive-thru window. Another patient stands at the counter waiting for a consultation on a potential drug interaction as the phone rings, unanswered, with a doctor on the other end. The waiting room fills up as immunization appointments begin to run behind.\n\n&gt;These working conditions have become so normal that all pharmacists like me can think is “it could be worse.” For us it has become just another Tuesday.\n\nI hope that it will resonate with those of you who work or have worked at chain pharmacies.

OK no problem, let's go house hunting so we can get out of our 1 bed apartment in the ghetto. \n\nAt 6 mos pregnant, her plant shuts down permanently and she's out of work. Goodbye house hunting...I'm stressing the fuck out on how I'm supposed to take care of the 3 of us on my salary alone.\n\nStart applying for jobs everywhere. Even out of state. Find the most ridiculous dollar/hr job out there and apply.

After nearly 10 years in industrial maintenance in 3 different industries, I finally found a job that I actually enjoy AND pays me what I think is a pretty incredible wage for a younger guy with no fancy degrees or schooling apart from trade school and apprenticeship. I honestly feel like any good maintenance electrician should be making at least 100k a year base if they know their stuff and an asset to the team.\n\nI feel extremely blessed to have had this happen to me.

We got tons of AI generated and fake applicants.

We provide a competitive base salary (near the bottom of our region's range but still competitive), benefits (standard benefits package) and competitive TC which is driven entirely by RSUs. On top of this we are 100% Remote with anything in office being handled by 5 people who live local (includes myself). We are posting to LinkedIn and have a strong LinkedIn presence. The job postings are posted by our company and not the hiring agency. The listing passes my filter for \"I'd apply for this\".\n\nThe only thing I can think of is that we are not \"Big Tech\". I work at a small company (&lt;50 employees). Is this hurting access to the job pool? Are our recruiters being too restrictive in filtering?

      "title": "Mid Level Engineer's Job Hunt Experience",
      "text": "After all the doom and gloom of the market I wanted to post my experience. Especially since I am younger in my career (4 years) in comparison to many here who are job hunting. I recently went through the whole shebang and wanted to shed some light for those who are definitely not a junior but may not be a senior yet.\n\nTLDR: I started searching in late July. Sent out about \\~80 applications until mid August which is when the interviews started to kick in. Out of those 80 I had 5 callbacks (i.e. actual chances to interview). I went through the interview process with 4 out of 5 companies and received 4 offers. The offer I accepted was a significant pay increase both base salary wise and especially total compensation.\n\nOkay so the details\n\n**Why'd I start searching?**\n\nI started searching because I reached a tipping point in frustration at my previous role mainly due to my apathetic coworkers, blame-oriented management, and because of where I am in life outside of work. What I mean by that last part, is that I am young and have no big responsibilities, which allows me to take the risk of making a large jump in my career and even going somewhere to \"grind\". I also recognized that I was starting to stagnate in most facets of an engineering career such as pay, technical expertise, and breadth of knowledge. \n\nI very clearly defined what I **needed** and **wanted** in my next job, those being:\n\n* **needed** to be in a different industry\n* **needed** to make at least the same total compensation\n* **needed** the new team to pass the \"vibe check\"\n* **needed** the job to not be through a contracting agency\n* **wanted** to have a different tech stack\n* **wanted** to be in the same city I was or a specific other city\n* **wanted** to be closer to hardware instead of pure software\n* **wanted** to make more than current total compensation\n\nNOTE: *One thing that is not a* ***need*** *or* ***want*** *for me here that is different than many other people is WLB. This just isn't super important to me at this point in my life and I am hungry to grow.*\n\n**How did I apply?**\n\nWith this and an updated resume I set off on my job hunt. I won't go too into details about my resume simply because I don't have an anonymized version. I don't really think my resume was the biggest differentiator here. However, it was parse-able for ATS systems and contained a ton of \"key word\" technologies like Kafka, AWS, React, Springboot, Kubernetes, etc.\n\nI had a pretty simple routine. I'd go grab a coffee and some breakfast in the wait room or a private area. Then I'd spend the first \\~45min-1hr of every work day applying or preparing/studying. Leetcode and practicing my behaviorals was how I studied in the beginning but once I was comfortable with any easy level problems I kind of just stopped leetcoding. IMO, there's heavy diminishing returns with leetcode very quickly. For applying, I first created a list of companies I was fairly confident hit my **needs** and **wants** and scoured their careers pages. After that, it was just straight LinkedIn jobs. Of the 4 interviews I went through 3 of them came from Linkedin and 1 came from direct careers page. As far as applying I sought after anything that hit my **needs** that was recently posted (last week?). I very quickly ran out of recently posted jobs that hit my needs which is when I set my goal of 5 applications every workday. So like the first 30 minutes of this routine would be applying, then the latter half would be searching for postings for the next day. Near the end of my 80 applications I was really struggling to find jobs that were worth applying to and called it quits, then I started getting interviews.\n\n**Interviewing**\n\nOut of the 80 applications I got 5 different companies wanting to interview which really surprised me after hearing how bad the market was. I really think this came down my tech stack, my location, my willingness to go in office, the fact I am \"cheap\" to hire compared to seniors, my pickiness of where I applied, and just dumb luck.\n\nThe 1 company I declined to interview with was simple, they didn't meet by **need** to make at least the same total compensation. I also already had other interviews lined up and did not have the bandwidth to prepare for another even if I was just gonna use it as practice.\n\nSo for the 4 I had I started studying fairly hard. Some light leetcode, working on THREE different personal projects, behavioral, and company research. Once I finished my first interview and bombed my first ever system design portion that was then added on as well. Out of this preparation I think studying the companies and really honing in on my behavioral helped the most. There's a base level of competency expected via leetcode or other technical interviews, but once that is met I think these matter so so so much more. Studying the companies really helped me prepare for what the interview was going to be like and if there was specific tech or problems they'll bring up give me foresight.\n\nThis is also where there was the most turmoil.. Companies either got the process over with immediately and wanted an answer with 1-2 days OR they would flip flop around on scheduling because of various issues. For 2 of the companies the jobs either got filled half-way through the process OR the job went away completely due to budget cuts or restructuring. While, in my instance, both of these companies came back with other opportunities it really scared the shit out of me and I could see how unstable the market was. \n\nAll interviews had at least these portions:\n\n1. HR screening\n2. Technical test (leetcode, practical, something else)\n3. Behavioral test\n\nDuring this time is also when I'd conduct my \"vibe checks\" of the teams. Like is often said this is your opportunity to interview them as they are doing to you. 2/4 of the companies failed the vibe checks hard. You could just tell I'd be walking into an impersonal dumpster fire. If I did not have a chance to interview with the direct team I'd be working with, I flat out wouldn't work there regardless. That's too big a risk in my eyes.\n\n**Accepting offer**\n\nI'll just quickly lay out the companies:\n\n* Company A - Big company in different industry, same enterprisey tech stack, fair total comp, lowest base pay, vibe check was utterly failed\n* Company B- Direct competitor to my current company in big banking, same enterprisey tech stack, high total comp, highest base pay, vibe check was off\n* Company C - Startup vibe of company but matured (10+ yrs old), different industry and tech stack, total comp was the lowest of all but the base pay was nice, vibe check passed\n* Company D - More of a true start up (again mature) but gearing up to go public in next couple of years, different industry and tech, total comp was fairly close to company B, base pay was second highest, and I would have worked much closer to hardware\n\nWhen I first started getting offers, company D was one of the ones who dropped out of interviewing. So I initially accepted C. It was the least pay of all 4 but that's not what I was after, I was after growth and learning, plus I still made more than my current job.\n\nLiterally the day I accepted the offer company D reaches back out saying the position was open again. This was a dream company for me so we went through the process and I ended up getting the offer. I accepted it and renege company C which understandably ghosted me as soon as I sent that email. This again scared the piss out of me because the instability in the market made me worried who I accepted would just rug pull me and be like \"jk you have no job\". \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nI know without a doubt I was very lucky in my search. My interviews expected me to have way more ownership and breadth than I would have expected for someone at my level, luckily I did have that experience. In retrospect I think the biggest differentiators for my success in the search was being really picky on the jobs I applied to, willingness to be in office, and a lot of ownership/breadth from previous role. I didn't end up taking the highest paying job because that wasn't what was most important to me. So far the new role has been great and filled a lot of void I was missing at my previous role, but only time will tell if it was the right choice!",

      "title": "Late to clinical... Automatic fail",
      "text": "So, I'm in my 5th semester of the nursing program and today was the third and final clinical of the semester. I accidentally slept through my alarm this morning and ended up being 30 minutes late to clinical, my professor tells me she has to send me home due to being more than 15 minutes late. She went on to say that because of this, I automatically fail the entire course. The ENTIRE course .... Devastated, I began crying uncontrollably, because I have been killing myself to get through this program as a mother of two young kids and a husband who works two jobs (bless him). I am never late to lectures or labs and have been maintaining good grades from the start. Here's the kicker though, to retake this course, the school will make me wait until January because the next cohort has too many students and they can't fit me in. Currently, I'm reaching out to another school to see about starting in their nursing program in August. Overall, this all just feels like a huge punch to the gut and I'm feeling so incredibly defeated. I feel like a failure, even though I really know I'm not. I'm aware being late is nobody else's fault but my own, I just wanted to get this off my chest. It's been a rough morning. Has anyone else experienced something like this with their school? I'd like to hear thoughts and opinions.\n\nUPDATE: Sorry everyone, a few days late on updating you. It's been a lot to process. So, the meeting with the Dean went much as anticipated. She said there are no make ups or exceptions for being late to a clinical unless there was some sort of extreme illness, injury, or other extenuating circumstance of equal severity. This means that they are indeed failing me for the course. However, they won't know for a few more weeks what the final headcount of the next cohort will be yet. Until they have that information, I won't know if I can retake the course next semester or if they're going to have to make me wait until January. So until then, I'm just focusing on my other courses and those assignments for now. I haven't had the opportunity to speak to a counselor at the other school I'm considering yet due to the 4th of July holiday/weekend, but I will reach out to them Monday to ask all of the questions. It's a pretty disappointing update, I know. I'm feeling pretty disappointed about it myself, crushed would be a more accurate term, actually. \n\nOverall, I take responsibility for my mistake, being late was on me. But, I will say one thing, after reading all of your comments and thoughts on this, it is frustrating knowing that so many other schools offer some form of clinical makeup in situations like mine and it isn't such a major setback for students. Going forward though, I will be making some changes and taking the advice I've received from you all about setting multiple alarms for myself to ensure this never happens again. I'll provide another update once the Dean gets back to me about the timeline for retaking the course. \n\nThanks so much everyone for the love and feedback I've gotten, it's so much more than I expected and it has helped me get through this more than you know ❤️",

More than 4,200 teaching positions remain vacant, with a majority of them being filled by substitutes or other part-time solutions.\n\nIn a poll sent to school districts and charters, of the 4,200 teaching positions that remain vacant, 30% are being covered by long-term substitutes, nearly 24% are filled by existing teachers who are working through their prep or planning time and nearly 23% are covered by “agency temporary personnel,” ADE said. After that, about 1,400 positions remain completely unfilled.\n\nI'm not shocked that AZ is having this issue. Starting salary in a district I began my career in was $34,700. In over 20 years, that starting salary has gone up only $8k. What a joke. If they paid a living wage and treated teachers with respect, then the shortage wouldn't be so large.",

      "text": "I’ve seen a lot of posts for inspiration lately and I wanted to chime in. You can do it! All I can say is that you have to put yourself out there and network. \n\nI quit my job as a property manager beginning of 2023 as my wife was employed so she could support us while I focused on my career change. Due to unforeseen circumstances she got laid off a month later which put us in a difficult position. I studied my butt off for certs and got my A+ with about 2 months of study. By this time it was April and I started applying like crazy. I was getting no responses at all and had to pick up a server job to support our bills as our savings was running out. I was getting interviews here and there but no results until one day I was serving a customer and they were wearing an IT shirt. I asked him how he got into the business and what I can do to propel myself and get noticed. We chatted for quite a bit and he ended up passing me a number to a recruiter. I reached out to the recruiter and was set up with an interview immediately and got the job about a week and a half later as a PC Tech I for the city government as a 6 month contract employee. The pay was $20/HR with zero benefits or holidays but I made sure to keep improving and gained my Security + a few months later and stood in great standing with my peers. \n\nThey ended up offering me a full time position but by this time I got an offer for Technical Analyst II at an MSP as a fully remote employee. This job was for a small MSP that paid $55K a year with benefits. Within 4 months I was up for promotion and was promoted to a Cloud Solutions Analyst which brought my pay to $60K. I enjoyed working there but the growth didn’t align with what I wanted to do so I started applying again with my newly learned skills and updated resume. \n\nI ended up getting an interview with a real estate software company and negotiated my salary to be $30/HR which is roughly $62,400 a year with full benefits and more flexibility albeit in the office 2 days. Currently, I am enjoying my position here and learning as much as I can. Also making sure I’m putting myself out there to expose myself to different technologies. \n\nSo from August 2023 to August 2024 I went from a $20/HR contract job to full time $30/HR full benefits job. I know if I can do it then you can do it! Don’t give up!",

      "text": "OT is a wonderful and rewarding profession. However, if you're considering OT school, it's crucial that you have a clear and realistic financial plan to manage your student debt. Understand exactly what you're committing to financially before diving in.\n\nHere are some practical suggestions to minimize debt:\n\nStay with family during your program if possible, or share housing expenses with roommates or a partner.\n\nOpt for an affordable master’s program rather than an expensive doctorate. Doctorate degrees usually do not lead to significantly higher salaries, despite costing substantially more.\n\nConsider completing your undergraduate degree in three years, especially if you have AP credits. This can reduce overall costs significantly.\n\nWork and save money before entering OT school, perhaps with a bachelor's degree in a related or alternative field.\n\nIf feasible, live with family after graduation to quickly reduce your student loan burden.\n\nDiscuss openly with your partner about strategies to collectively handle your loans (such as dedicating one income to loan payments for a few years).\n\nExplore less expensive routes into healthcare, such as becoming a PTA or COTA first, to greatly reduce educational expenses.\n\nThink about working in travel OT, home health, or skilled nursing facilities, which often offer better pay to help manage debts.\n\nBe aware that some states have entry-level OT positions paying as low as $28/hr (\\~$58k), and even long-term salaries may not surpass $67k in outpatient pediatric settings. On the other hand, nurse practitioners and physician assistants, requiring similar amount of education (master's degrees), typically earn significantly higher salaries, often starting above $100k.\n\nOnly choose OT if you're absolutely sure that it's the right career path for you. While OT can be deeply fulfilling, many students enter programs accruing tens of thousands in debt without a clear strategy to pay it off, causing financial strain and stress. OT salaries generally range between $60k to $70k annually in many areas, so meticulous financial planning is critical.\n\nThis advice isn't meant to deter you, but rather to ensure you're informed and confident about your decision. Ultimately, you're the best judge of your personal finances, goals, and life commitments. Make your choice thoughtfully to ensure a fulfilling and sustainable career.\n\nEdit: Glad this post could serve as a place where a lot of you can offer your own opinions, as obviously above is just my own. Its important we as therapists talk about these things to each other and show it to perspective therapists, so people can enter the profession for the right reasons. I actually love being a therapist but the pay and productivity/documentation requirements, as well as treating taking a lot out of you does make it a challenging job. \n\nFor those of you who are newer to the profession or are at times struggling just like I do here are some of the best resources. (A little bias cuz I work in Peds) \n\n  \nFor helping planing intervtions and tone of activities with my kiddos : [this ](https://www.toolstogrowot.com/)\n\nFor accessing research articles once your school's log in stops working: [this](https://www.academia.edu/) \n\nFor making documentation faster/easier: [this](http://trynonotes.com)\n\nHere to only offer my perspective and I actually think its important that if you disagree with me you should comment, so people do get a good idea mix of opinions and not my own. I hope any of this helps you. ",

This information wasn’t on the district website (or else I wouldn’t have applied) and I’m assuming they’re not honoring more years due to budget cuts. Anyway, I asked if there was any way I could speak to someone in HR to see if we could discuss it since I had the experience that the school/district was looking for and bc I was very interested in the position (the salary that they were offering just wouldn’t work, especially since I was already taking a pay cut in general). The principal explained the next steps in the hiring process, said that someone from HR would call me with the job offer and we could discuss everything. Two days later I get a call from the principal (not HR) saying that she spoke to HR and that they decided to go with a different candidate. It was a huge slap in the face bc I was super excited to work for this district. I know nothing is set in stone until contracts are signed, but there wasn’t an inclination that they’d revoke their verbal offer. It all felt very shady and made me dislike the education field even more than I already do. It’s disgusting how cheap these districts are. And they wonder why teachers are leaving in droves. Rant over. ",

      "text": "Hey guys, I posted this here back in mid-september after being laid off (Reduction in Force in the US) from the company I was with for just shy of 15 years. \n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1ndzitt/rifd_after_14_years_355_days/\n\nAs an update, I put my resume in a few places and did some social networking and although I had initially only put my resume in at a few places, I did get a hit back and accepted a job offer.\n\nOne of the two places it was a Sr Network Engineer - Unified Communications position with the company itself, and the second is a Systems Engineer position for an MSP.\n\nI went with the MSP, primarily because the other company didn't offer (lol). I could tell in the interview for the Sr. Network Engineer position that I had been pegged as an \"Operations guy\" given that I worked at an MSP for 15 years. \n\nIt's a little tragic, as it makes me feel like I'm an MSP guy for life.  I've done countless upgrades, planning for such upgrades, compatibility checks and advisement on other products that need to come in-line on versioning, brought up new call centers, sunset others... I've done it all, so it's really depressing to hear the remark \"Ah, so you're an operations guy\" and the next day hear they aren't interested in continuing. Bah.\n\nFor me, maintaining income and avoiding unemployment was paramount. I was able to secure a new role with less, but relatively comparable salary as I had previously, and I accepted the job offer about 3-3.5 weeks after I was let go. I was amazed I was able to get into a place that quickly.\n\nAt any rate, it's back to MSP land for me. I'll be working with some lovely sysadmins on their Cisco Unified Communications environments, cursed to manage upteen environments instead of a single one. :(\n",

If you live in one of the high cost\nof living cities, YOU are more than likely underpaid.\nThese days, unless you're content with being a troglodyte with an hour+ commute, eating shit food,\nand saving a pitiful amount, you need to ask for\nmore. A lot more. Get out of the pre-COVID\nmentality, not that you were getting what you were worth then, either. Everything is so fucking expensive. Inflation happened and so did corporate greed. No\none is making enough to have children let alone give\nthem a good life. No one is making enough to own a\nhome. No one is making enough to even feel like the\nphysical and mental toll on yourselves is truly worth it. Meanwhile your boss is driving a new truck, shmoozing with clients, bought a boat, new SUV for wife, kids, house, organic food, vacations, everything - then has the audacity to complain that people are asking too much or he can’t find any good help. NO SHIT, it’s supply and demand! If your city is overrun with tech salaried people like SF, Seattle, Austin, or just HCOL like NYC, LA, San Diego everyone with skill has been priced out or is demanding to be paid more. $50/hr isn’t even enough to have a good life in some of these major HCOL cities, and that is what wages are mostly topping at across the board for LEAD carpenters. If you’re even “lucky” enough to be offered benefits: Fuck the benefits, we want enough money to pay for our own healthcare, our own time off, and our own investment choices. We don’t want to be owned by a company that is underpaying us but keeping us on a leash by controlling our health, our time off, and our retirement. Humans want freedom. Money is freedom in our society, and we all need more of it for what we’re doing. \n\nEdit:\nI hope this post inspires some of you to go in tomorrow and ask to speak to the boss, HR, whoever it may be about getting a raise. These companies need us and are hurting for labor. Talk to your coworkers, well, the ones you can stand and who aren’t mouth breathers. I’m not talking about unionization, I’m just talking about demanding more. There’s a reason we are employees and not union - we value our freedom. Money is freedom. Go and get yours. \n\nEdit 2:\nAs of now, 86,000 people have seen this post. Imagine the impact it could have if all of those people talked to their coworkers and all demanded a raise. ",

      "text": "  \nI’m reaching out because I’ve been struggling with something that I think many of us might relate to: our pay compared to the responsibility and investment it takes to become a PA.\n\nI work in critical care medicine in NYC and have been practicing for the last year. Recently, I found out that my sister, an RN who graduated just 6 months ago, is taking home the same paycheck that I do. We both make about $3,800 every two weeks after tax—with no overtime for either of us. The difference? I went through graduate school, invested nearly $200K in my education, and carry a very different scope of responsibility. She completed an accelerated nursing program for a fraction of the cost.\n\nOn top of that:\n\n* She earns **1.5x overtime** pay for extra shifts, while I only get a flat \\~$20/hr increase for PRN shifts.\n* She gets a **pension**, while I do not.\n* She has scheduled breaks, while I rarely do.\n* And she works in a suburban area with much lower cost of living, while my NYC rent is almost double hers.\n\nMeanwhile, I see RNs in my own hospital with these same benefits and protections. To be clear—I’m not upset at nurses; they’ve done an incredible job advocating for themselves in NYC, LA, SF, and other metro areas to secure fair, often excellent, compensation. My question is: **how can we as PAs do the same?**\n\nI want to learn from experienced PAs:\n\n* What steps can we take collectively to **elevate our profession** and negotiate for better compensation and benefits?\n* On a personal level, what moves have you made to grow **financially as a PA**—whether through job changes, side work, investing, or even shifting specialties—that made the career more worthwhile for you?\n* Are there organizations or advocacy efforts we should be rallying behind to make sure PAs don’t get left behind in the larger healthcare pay landscape?\n\nI love the work I do, but I need to see a clearer path to financial growth and professional respect.

Some of us grew up around people with certain medical problems, like maybe seizures or kidney disease or alcoholism, or we may have health problems ourselves. We may know more about some random aspect of EMS just because of life happening to us, and this may give us a leg up on helping certain patients better than others.\n\nIn both the hospital and on the ambulance, I used to make a point to repeat my patients' symptoms in detail to other people, especially if it was neuro, psych, or musculoskeletally related. An athlete broke their leg and has sensation in just their big toe but not the others? Cool, let's put that in that chart. A seizure patient is seeing red and blue swirls and hearing buzzing 2 minutes before their seizures? Put that in the chart. I would make a point to tell the nurses and docs at the hospital these same details on hand-off, even if I got a weird look. I figured that these kinds of things matter to their doctor, who has to call the shots on a near stranger's health.\n\nI don't know about you guys, but some of the folks that I have worked with have treated me like I'm naive for caring about these details. There's a retort of, \"Oh, you don't have to put that in the chart. It doesn't matter.\" Or, \"You can just put 'toe numbness' down.\" More ER and floor nurses than I would have expected take this approach as well. The lack of care for detail is a bummer, because I know from my biology and neuro background that all of this shit is connected. The kidneys affect the heart affects the brain affects the immune system, and it goes on and on. Details matter, and putting them in the chart matters. Like, why even have this job or keep taking CMEs if I just to write on every little grandma's chart, \"RLQ stomach pain x3 days,\" and then go fuck off to the station and take another nap? There's more to this patient's story, even if I am technically allowed to forget that they exist once I clock out.\n\nAnyway, I was talking to one of the neurosurgeons at the hospital about one of their patients as they were reviewing the chart, and the reports from all of that patient's multi-physician team were insanely detailed. It was stuff like, \"Experiences psychosis after eating bread,\" and, \"Sees red and green blocks in upper left of field-of-view in morning only.\" It was unreal. Just wildly detailed things that were written exactly how the patient experienced them. No vagueness. No judgment or laughing about the patient \"making things up\" at the nurses' station. Just attention to detail and trusting the patient.\n\nI looked at the doctor and asked, \"You guys care about this stuff?\" The doc said, \"Yeah, absolutely. If a person usually hallucinates red and green shapes before brain surgery, but now they're seeing blue and yellow shapes after, we need to know. Maybe we have to go back in or change their meds.\" I told the doc that more folks in EMS than they would have guessed have expressed irritation about noting these kinds of things, but the doc said, \"If I read something that detailed in an ambulance report, I would want to know where they worked, so I could give them a prize.\"\n\nI don't know your experiences in EMS. Maybe you have worked at places that championed detailed charting and Michelin star medicine. I'm also no medical genius, and I have much to learn. The medics and nurses who chastised me about charting also taught me other cool things that my dumb-ass didn't know. Some medics and nurses were also just as jazzed about the details as I was. With that being said, this conversation with the neurosurgeon showed me how EMS and ED charts matter and that the details that our patients tell us can actually help their doctors fix them. It didn't feel like my extensive charting marked me as some greenhorn EMT grad at that point. Our charting of some seemingly superfluous symptom may actually change our patients' treatment weeks or months down the line. If some salty bastard is going to make you feel like a gullible child for caring about that and being curious about your patient, then that is their own prerogative.\n\nDoes this fit with your experience? What do you guys think?\n\nNote: slightly changed details about the patient and the doc, because HIPAA/PHI.",

Obviously, this is heavily dependent on districts and mainly whether you're in a strong union state or not.  \n  \n99% of our headaches at work come from other adults - be it admins or parents, and the former folds to the craziest of the latter. Every job has BS bureaucracy, and education administration tends to be particularly frustrating, but it's not just education. Crazy parents have always existed, but if you have competent administrators, they should shield you from that. 99% of parents are awesome and just want the best for their kids - the crazies are just the loudest. \n\nMost of the kids are awesome, and even though we see a lot of posts about crazy behaviors here, most of them are awesome. They're kids and will do kid stuff, but if they don't have an admin or a parent enabling them, 99% of them will recognize it and take accountability. \n\nPlenty of people in education love their job, plenty work it as just a job for the pension, it's just not represented here. If I were in university right now, I would still choose this line of work. I wouldn't tell people not to do so, as long as they are aware of the realities of the bureaucracy/behaviors ",

      "title": "20+1 Tips: The Unofficial Survival Guide for New Grad PAs",
      "text": "We all know about onboarding &amp; CME… but I’ve come up with a list of real-life hacks, shortcuts and tips that make the chaos of your rookie year more survivable. Like an unofficial cheat sheet.\n\nThis is mostly tailored for acute, inpatient settings (ER, ICU, etc) but honestly everybody can use a few of these.\n\nHere goes: \n\n1. Find your pooping bathroom on Day 1. Not the one on the unit that everyone uses. The one wayyy down the hall in the corner that barely gets any sunlight. It might even be on a different floor. This is more important than your login credentials. \n2. Learn all the nurses’ names ASAP. The good ones will save your ass. The great ones will quietly warn you before you step in shit. \n3. Say hello/good morning/good afternoon to everyone, from custodial staff to other providers. It forces people to look at your face when they otherwise wouldn’t have. Being a familiar face will save you one day … and it’s just good manners.\n4. Especially ER or anything procedure- heavy. Keep one set of backup scrubs in your car. There WILL be blood, vomit, poop, or something unidentifiable and the hospital issued scrubs fit horribly. \n5. Figure out the food situation early on. What is the shortest route to the cafeteria? Where’s the microwave/fridge? Which nurse/provider always has a snack? When do reps bring lunch? This is survival intel.\n6. Learn which attending will actually teach you and which will roast you. Seek the teachers out. They’re worth gold.\n7. Save dot phrases early. If you write something more than twice, turn it into a template or dot phrase. Your future self will thank you.\n8. Identify the gossip triangle and avoid it. Every workplace has one. Stay out of it or you’ll be the topic by Friday.\n9. Similar to the above tip, limit the amount of personal info you share at work. Chat casually, but your coworkers don’t need your entire life story. (Pro tip: being young, childless, or unmarried may make you the “go-to” for short-staffed coverage… reveal details with caution)\n10. Wear layers. Hospitals are hot and cold zones. Sweaters and undershirts are your friends.\n11. Learn what you can delegate early. You’re not a martyr, you’re a provider. Use techs, nurses, RTs. It keeps patients safer. \n12. Similarly, remember you’re NOT too good for anything. You’re not too good to ask for (and OFFER!) help. Don’t let the hierarchy get to your head. At the end of the day, we’re all here to help patients. \n13. Create your own cheat sheet. Common meds with dosages, top 5-10 complaints with management, treatment algorithms, short list of most important phone numbers. I have a one page Word Doc saved to my email that I pull up before even logging into the EMR for the day. You won’t need it after a while but it certainly helps early on.\n14. A really good backpack/work bag, travel mug, and set of pens are worth their weight in gold. \n15. Learn who actually runs the place. Hint: probably not the doctor. Sometimes it’s the charge nurse. It’s usually the unit clerk or front desk lady. \n16. Get comfortable saying “I don’t know.” Faking it gets people hurt.\n17. Know your escape route. Find your spot to cry, to vent, to breathe for 5 minutes. Map it out before you need it. \n18. Pick your battles. You don’t have to fix every broken process on Day 1… as much as we all want to. \n19. Find your “phone-a-friend.” It may be a doctor, it might be another PA. It might be your friend in a totally different state that has experience in the specialty. Have someone you can text about a weird lab value or a scary case without feeling dumb.\n20. Have a post-shift ritual. Especially if you work long blocks in a row (looking at you 7on/off-ers &amp; 12 hour shifters) Find your small thing that signals to your brain that work is over. For me, I listen to the same song on the way home. I’m almost conditioned now. I get SOOOO relaxed when I hear it in the wild. \n\n\nAnd perhaps the most important one… Celebrate regularly. Treat yourself. You’re learning fast &amp; deserve to celebrate. I keep a “mini-win” list for when I get discouraged. \n\n\nYour first year will be chaos, but it’s where you grow the most. Stay humble, stay teachable, and when in doubt: snacks, nurses, and bathrooms are the holy trinity.”",

My manager supports me tremendously, has always believed in me, and is literally fighting these months to get me an additional promotion before my next rotation. She makes me visible to upper management, gives me interesting work, tries to develop my skills, speaks highly of me to everyone.\n\nMy entire department is being moved to India. Instead of doing a “normal” rotation as planned in the program, I was asked to stay a few extra months for the transition. \nThe director, not my manager, even created a custom role for my third rotation once this transition wraps up. A role that’s never been opened to anyone else in the program and it’s definitely interesting (similar scope to what I’m getting in my new offer). It signals trust and visibility.\n\nThen this offer comes through. 90%+ raise, significant title bump, from a larger multinational. For the same salary, I’d probably need another 3–4 years where I am now.\n\nObjectively irrefutable for my career stage and cost of living.\n\nBut here’s the drama: I know for a fact that leaving now puts her in a difficult spot. The India transition gets messier, my manager loses her only real ally on the team (it’s just the two of us), and all the work she’s done to advocate for me… yeah.\n\nI understand rationally that this is the right move for my career.

Or am I just being too empathetic and should prioritize myself, full stop?",

The presentation will be followed by Q&amp;A and Mr. Moon will be available to sign books.\n\nJohn Moon began his EMS career in 1972 with Freedom House Ambulance, after seeing the impressive crews in action while he was working as an orderly in a local hospital. After completing the necessary training on his own, he was hired by Freedom House and changed the course of his life. Mr. Moon demonstrated his competence and determination at his new-found calling and was selected by Dr. Peter Safar to be the first medic to perform endotracheal intubation on patients in surgery. After succeeding on his first attempt in the operating room, Moon went on to perform what is believed to be the nation’s first intubation in the field by a paramedic. When the City of Pittsburgh ended its contract with Freedom House in 1975 and instituted its own ambulance service, Moon was one of the few Freedom House paramedics who successfully made (and endured) the transition.

      "title": "Third NPTE Retake, PASS, and tips",
      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI made a post back in July that I didn't pass on my second attempt, but I'm making another one now because I FINALLY PASSED on this third try. It's definitely been a rollercoaster of emotions these last couple months of restudying for it. I honestly really contemplated giving up on PT all together because I was so burnt out from studying. \n\nI want to let everyone know who weren't able to pass on this most recent attempt that I BELIEVE in you. For those who are planning to retake it in January, one of the best advice I got was to make sure you take breaks. If you're anything like me, I always tend to overstudy but we need to remind ourselves that these breaks helps refuel our energy to study again. We're not robots and we need time to consolidate the information. With that said make sure to enjoy the holidays. Spend time with friends and family and make sure you don't put your life on hold for this test. The NPTE will always be there, but the memories we choose to make now won't. \n\nAlso, if you're wondering in terms of the material what helped me pass. I HIGHLY recommend purchasing for the NPTE breakdown report for 100$ and TherapyEd's 3x practice exams for 100$ (total of 200$). The NPTE breakdown report helps show what your strengths/weaknesses are for the subjects, at which points of the test did the fatigue kick in, &amp; etc. The therapyed practice exams were BY FAR the closest thing to the NPTE that I've taken. What's cool about it is like the NPTE breakdown report it'll show what your strengths/weaknesses on the subjects are and rationales for why questions you got were correct/incorrect, and a score which indicates how ready you are after taking the test. I've taken so many practice exams like the PEATS from the NPTE website, final frontier practice exams, practice exams I found online, but TherapyEd BY FAR was the best in my opinion. \n\nAdditionally, HONE in on your MSK, cardiopulm, neuro, and differential diagnoses material. I've taken over 3000 questions during my second attempt and taking questions mindlessly will get you nowhere. If you have a really good understanding of the 3 subjects, you'll pretty much understand 80% of the test. For example really understand what the purposes of this special test is, why this muscle has this action/innervation will cause this impairment ex: during gait, why would a patient with a damaged deep fibular nerve demonstrate circumduction during swing phase of gait (because they're unable to clear their limb due to a weakened anterior tib muscle that is not dorsiflexing during swing), differentiate diagnoses like if a patient demonstrates bilateral LE edema, is it CHF, lymphedema, kidney failure, etc. Understand cardio pulmonary diseases restrictive vs. obstructive, different neurological diseases, and outcome measures! The outcome measure questions come out alot in those 3 part case scenario questions so be able to understand that this outcome measure for example the Stroke IMPACT scale (SIS) is a SELF-REPORTED questionnaire vs. NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is an actual measure of stroke severity. These were just random questions that popped into my head while restudying it, but REALLY UNDERSTAND the 3 core subjects and not move on if something is not making sense to you. It is not a waste of time. \n\nLastly, if you made it this far. YOU ARE GOING TO PASS AND NEVER NEED TO STUDY/TAKE THIS STUPID TEST AGAIN. Believe me when I say I know all the emotions you're feeling because I've been in your shoes twice already. YOU WILL PASS AND I BELIEVE IN YOU. My friend once told me that life is tough and will probably only get harder from here, but you can only get stronger 💪💪. GOOD LUCK on this last time you will ever study for this test and HAPPY HOLIDAYS from the bottom of my heart!!!!!",

      "text": "Previous post:\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/ems/s/jiIWp20kvM  \n\nI think I mentioned in the comments that I was visiting the ER for post-exposure rabies shots.  This means four visits to the ER, and each time I've said or done something stupid.  \n\nFor my latest visit I went at 09:30 to beat the rush.  They process traumas about as well as Frank Castle, so I knew there wouldn't be any morning commute accidents.  I did the same routine, check in at the admission desk, they scan my ID, I get my bracelet and chuckle that it says \"dipshit\", then park my ass in the empty waiting room for about thirty seconds before the nurse calls me in.  \n\nNow, it might've been that I hadn't slept much for a couple days, or that she put the autocuff over my two shirts, but my BP read as about 20 points below normal.  I haven't run my stupid mouth for about five seconds at this point, so I ask:\nme: **Am I gonna live?**  \nNurse: **I'm afraid so**\nme: ***goddamnit***\n\nNo chuckle, no acknowledgement at all from the nurse.  That's fine, not everyone loves the dark stuff, even when it's corny.  A few keystrokes later she says **\"ok, in case it gets busy we're gonna put you in another room over here while I go get your shot\"**  and has me take a seat.\n\nI recognized the room immediately, having transferred patients to and from this room.  This holding room.  **This. fucking. behavioral. holding room.**  i can't believe with all the dumb shit I've said and done, that it's an \"am I gonna live\" that gets me a fucking three day time out?  No, no, I talked myself into this, I can maaaaaaaaaybe talk myself out of it.  \n\nThe nurse comes back with the vial and syringe.  **\"Heyyy, I thought this room looked familiar.  This is behavioral holding, isn't it?\"** I ask, already knowing the answer.  **\"it used to be, but now it's just our fast track.\"**  I don't let on that I know she's bullshitting me, the bed and chairs still have BH signs and numbers above them.  After giving me the shot, she says **\"ok, just hang out a few minutes and someone from registration will be with you shortly.\"**  Well that can't be right, and I tell her I registered when I came in, they even scanned my license.  **\"oh, it's to give you your discharge papers\"**.\n\nMy spidey sense *knows* I'm being lied to  now.  Nurses, PA's, even doctors give you your walking papers, as long as it's someone who can clarify something or answer questions, not the front desk.  After a minute, a lady with a clipboard comes in, surely the travel agent for my grippy sock vacation.  She verifies my name and date of birth, and asks one more question with a very serious tone:  \n**\"Do you know who might have changed your preferred name on your profile?\"**  \n\n***fucking. dipshit.***\n\nThe isolation and stalling was because my nurse had to show it to the charge nurse, thinking that someone on their end was commenting on me as a patient.  I poked my head out of the room to see clipboard lady go up to the charge nurse and relay my explanation of having changed it myself.  The charge nurse just looked down at the floor, her belief that she had seen everything was just proven wrong, and somehow it was still disappointing.   \n\ntl;dr - I went in for a shot and thought I got put in a holding cell because I made a joke about not wanting to live, but it was because I'm a dipshit.\n",

I have a girl and I want to be with her now, not in 120° heat of the kitchen all day.\n\nHypothetically this would be a great time for me to put together some awesome seasonal menus, really show people what can be done when I’m leading the kitchen, but I fucking am exhausted already, and I don’t think with all the work I’m doing, Ill be able to put out the creativity as when I was a salaried cook or sous with a little less responsibility.",

But what our industry has become is toxic and unbearable. We’re drowning under overwhelming patient loads, breaks are nonexistent or unreliable at best, and we’re constantly pressured to finish mountains of documentation on our own personal time. And yet, nobody dares to challenge this. It’s just accepted as “part of the job.” PTs don’t have unions. If we don’t advocate for ourselves, literally nobody else will. I tried speaking out this past year and was swiftly punished with false accusations and watched my performance rating plummet from “excelling” to “developing,” just a step away from termination. I vented on the PT subreddit, desperately seeking support, only to get reprimanded by administration for doing so. Tell me, where else are we supposed to turn? Facebook and other platforms are monitored, and we’re actively punished just for being honest about our struggles. Please don’t silence one of the only safe havens we have left. This isn’t an exaggeration; this is the grim reality of PT today. Without unions or advocacy, we’re left alone and penalized for even daring to speak up.",

Now I'm 37 so it makes roughly 15 years of experience. I also have a couple of successful startup + cash out under my belt.\n\nA few years ago I got promoted to tech lead, but after a few months I asked to switch back to senior backend because I was spending too much time managing people instead of dealing with tech problems. I always thought that what matter is money, and currently I feel like I have a good salary.\n\nAm I wrong in thinking I can be an engineer forever? Should I be more career focused? I got the doubt because I see some of my coworkers became directors, head of, .... While I roughly have the same title since forever, but I both hate and am bad at political / people topics\n\nEDIT: Thank you all for your kind words.

      "text": "Developed in the early 1900s, the Plug-Type Cutout is considered to be the very first commercially produced primary cutout in the industry. \n\nPrior to its introduction, primary protection for pole transformers was all but non-existent, and outages on entire feeders due to transformer faults were fairly common. This type of cutout was developed and produced when companies such as General Electric and Westinghouse saw the need for transformer protection to alleviate these problems. Typical ratings for these cutouts were 2,500-3,000 volts, with fuse sizes from 30-50 amps maximum. \n\nThese early cutouts relied on expulsion action to interrupt current flow, just as most modern cutouts do, albeit unconfined in a barrel or tube. Internal energized parts were in close proximity to each-other (and the operator), and were prone to arcing when attempting to break load. \n\nInjuries and fatalities sustained among linemen during operation of these cutouts were a frequent occurrence. They would often explode when closed in on a fault, sending porcelain shrapnel in every direction, or arc and burn/melt when pulled open under load. These characteristics, coupled with the fact that these had to be operated by hand, quickly earned them the nickname (suicide boxes) among linemen at the time. \n\nA practice was quickly developed among linemen of tying “monkey tails”, a short piece of rope tied to the plug handle, with a monkey’s fist knot at the other end. This allowed a lineman to grab and pull the plug from a greater distance, helping to lessen the hazard. In later years, special wooden “safety sticks” were developed to operate plug-type cutouts from a greater distance, increasing safety. These “safety sticks” would later lead to the development of the insulated switch stick. \n\nThese cutouts saw widespread use, well into the 1920s, before feigning obsolescence in the 1930s, replaced by porcelain “chocolate boxes” and open-type cutouts, which are the main type used today. \n\nPictures 1-5 are of GE and Westinghouse plug-type cutouts, showing the stab/plug, and the inside contacts. \n\nPicture 6 is of a typical early 1900s transformer installation, showing plug-type cutouts mounted to the top crossarm. \n\nPicture 7 shows some new-old stock fuse links for plug-types. These links are 100 years old!\n\nPictures 8-12 are vintage ads for plug-type cutouts, 1915-1921. \n",

I am located in the US.\n\nI've been talking with a company for months now and had several interviews even without a specific position available. Well they finally opened two positions, one associate and one senior with salary ranges of 66-99k and 130k-180k respectively. I applied for both and when HR got involved for the offer they said they could probably just split the difference for 110k. Sure that's fine. However, a couple days later, they called again and offered 60-70k, below even the lower limit of the associate range. So my question is has this happened to anyone else? Is this HR's way of trying to get me to just go away?\n\nMaybe I'm just frustrated since HR said the salary range listed on the job req isn't actually what they are willing to pay",

This is really intended for PAs who 1) feel burnt out at work especially early in the career (and I have noticed a fair amount are in IM and FM) who are interested in potentially changing specialties or jobs, and 2) those who feel bogged down in clinic work due to patient visits going over the limit and prolonged inbox work. \n\nThe first half will address picking a good job fit for you (there's another guide floating around about how money isn't everything and one about negotiating so I'll try to avoid overlap).\n\nThe second half is how to optimize clinic and inbox workflow to enjoy a lunch and getting out on time every day. Feel free to skip to whichever part you're interested in. As always my intent is only to help and never to offend. I am always open to feedback and people adding their own pearls of wisdom in the comments (invariably I always wish after seeing great comments I could edit my original post).\n\nVery briefly, I'm years over a decade in the game now having done many specialties and roles as a PA. I've been lucky to have a job that checks many boxes but I've also had jobs that made me want to pull my hair out. I also will say upfront that being able to move geographically (and I totally understand not everyone can) opens up substantial possibilities. The underserved healthcare areas (both rural and urban) often are a sweet spot for us PAs in terms of good pay, high autonomy, and reasonable cost of living. But there's many other factors to finding where you belong as a PA. So without further adue...\n\n___________________________\n\nI. Finding the right job fit \n\nQ: What specialty or job should I go into?\n\nPAs are a bit different than doctors in that the job itself has more to do with job satisfaction than the specialty. For example, some dermatology positions (a great lifestyle gig for docs, by which I mean good pay and good schedule with minimal call or dumpster fire emergencies) have poor pay and schedules for PAs. Alternatively some gunner positions such as neurosurgery (meaning jobs with high acuity, complex patients, but rough hours) can have a very accommodating schedule for PAs where the doctors deal with most the call and super stressful situations. \n\nThat said, fields that generally lead to high burnout are marked by two things: too many problems in a short time span, and too many high risk responsibilities without enough support. I had a job like this for years and loved it but after having kids it quickly became not for me. The classic fields this describes are CT surgery, neurosurgery, trauma and critical care, emergency medicine, NICU. I'm sure I'm forgetting some but those are typical examples. \n\nFamily, internal, hospitalist, and pediatric medicine while not always high acuity have high complexity and often pressure you to see one hundred problems an hour (sadly not pure hyperbole as four patients can easily have twenty five problems each in today's world) and belong on this list of high burnout jobs despite not being high acuity. \n\nThese jobs are great... For people who are impassioned by this line of work. An analogy: very social people would love to go out three nights a week for years on end. Others of us would just as soon stand in a corner before doing so. The important thing is matching the quality of work with what fufills you and doesn't leave you exhausted in your off time. \n\nThe more lifestyle specialties include dermatology, sleep medicine, wound care, low acuity plastics, low acuity ENT, pure clinic urology, radiation oncology, of course many others. \n\nIn the middle are various medical and surgical subspecialties. As you will fulfill a specialist role you get to focus on a few problems at a time (usually) and avoid a fair amount of scut work. This includes most surgical subspecialties that are mixed inpatient/outpatient/OR (Ortho, surgical and I'll add also medical oncology, head neck oncology, not purely outpatient urology [which is what I do], cardiology and EP (though this can be high acuity if mostly inpatient), burn medicine. Obviously many others here as well. \n\nFinally there are very niche fields including those that are purely OR based, purely procedure based (IR), and then the options for people who don't want to practice clinical medicine (occupational medicine to a degree, veteran exams, admin, education, or men's clinic or medical spa to a degree). \n\nAnd then there's of course urgent care. If you know, you know (jk my UC PAs, much love!)\n\nMy advice is think more about your lifestyle (enjoying yourself at work, good hours, enough time off, enough time with patients) twice as much as what specialty interests you. Granted some things just aren't gonna fit (I could never do OB GYN for example) but in general, better to be happy in a less \"interesting\" specialty than miserable in one that sounds really cool. I also would say really worry less about specialty than you do about getting the right fit. Which brings me to...\n\n___________________________\n\nQ: How do I find the right fit?\n\nYou need to get your priorities straight. You can have it all sometimes but often not. Decide what matters most out of:\n\n- salary (10K more a year to be miserable ain't worth it. But 40K more a year to deal with 25% more stress is quite reasonable for most of us)\n- schedule (hours that match your spouse or kids, versus shift work [three twelves or seven on seven off], days or nights)\n- how much time off, especially for those who love to travel\n- good education and positive vibes from colleagues, good support staff in clinic or OR\n- how much you wanna be challenged (you want the disaster patients often or more solveable problems?)\n- room for growth\n\nWhen you interview you need to be as honest as possible about what you want. In surgery how, much dedicated first assist time? If you love OR and hear \"let's get you set up in clinic first we'll figure that out later\" think twice. If you had a bad first job and need training and hear \"oh you'll shadow for a month then don't worry the doc is only a text away\", don't be fooled twice. \n\nGreen flags (not a slam dunk but a good sign): other PAs there happy, high staff retention, half days or admin time, doc who wants you to become autonomous (\"if you're interested you can also learn XYZ!\")\n\nRed flags (not a hard no but proceed with caution): never had a PA or they don't last long, high general staff turn over, call or significant extra hours without clear extra pay, working at multiple sites, people seem unhappy (trust your gut!)\n\n___________________________\n\nQ: But I really need a job / I already took a job I'm unhappy at\n\nGreat advice: the best time to job hunt is while currently employed. Grass isn't always greener but life is like a bicycle. If you just sit there, you fall on your ass. If you start pedelling (interview elsewhere even if don't accept it), you learn to ride and can easily begin to navigate the road and get to your destination. \n\nIf there's nothing better and you can't move, pause and try again in a couple months. \n\n___________________________\n\nQ: I'm unhappy in primary care, did I make a mistake being a PA?\n\nMy background originally was EM and IM. These PAs are true front line heroes and deserve the upmost respect (along with general surgery PAs, the front line of the surgical world). However the work is hard and underappreciated and not for everyone. Learning and seeing everything isn't fun forever for all of us. \n\nSwitching to subspecialty surgery for me was a game changer. No more ten problems, how about two or three or even one per patient. Inpatient I can do my thing and be done, no dispo problems. I still moonlight IM and have mad respect for it but always love going back to my real job where I don't have to think nonstop about everything. Generally the same applies for medical subspecialties (cardio, oncology, endocrinology, maybe not GI sorry y'all have it as rough as the PCPs!)\n\n___________________________\n\nQ: I'm unhappy and in a damn subspecialty, what about me?!\n\nYep, grass ain't always greener. IM you get a lot more autonomy especially compared to surgery or sub-subspecialty roles. Your patients often bring you Christmas gifts to clinic. So there's no one size fits all. The point is if you're unhappy don't ask \"did I choose the wrong field?\" Before first seriously ask \"am I in the right role for me?\"\n\nAgain, for PAs, job description often trumps specialty. I know urology PAs working fifty hours a week and IM PAs doing 32 hour work weeks. \n\nOkay so moving on. \n\n___________________________\n\nII. How to get home on time and enjoy lunch everyday. \n\nThis is getting long so I'm gonna focus purely on clinic for this post and in honor of the House of God, make this a ten commandments type situation. \n\nNow some may find this list harsh. I did too for a while. But wanna know what was harsher? My family seeing me get home late, tired, and grumpy consistently. So I decided to be \"harsh\" at work and let my family get the happy, please others version of me, not the other way around. \n\n1. Thou shall not do inbox work for free \n- if I can't tell my MA how to answer it for me, they're coming in to clinic to discuss whatever it is (obviously special circumstances merit exceptions for this and any other rule)\n- if I order a CT or specific lab panel, my patient will call and schedule to review with me in clinic, not discuss over the phone\n- if labs are overdue or last visit was missed, see me before a refill\n\n2. Thou shall demand patients respect thy time\n- if you're late and I can't spare the time, you're going to have to reschedule \n- when your time is up it's up. We can reschedule next available appointment to finish. I'll do my best to guide my patients. I'll block thirty min slots for known difficult patients. Those who want a half hour face to face for fifteen minute slots Will have the visit ended and be unhappy\n\n3. Thou shall do work of a PA\n- I don't expect my MA to diagnose and prescribe. My MA doesn't expect me to step on their toes either\n- scheduling and admin stuff? Sure, with dedicated admin time. Otherwise, thanks but no thanks!\n\n4. Thou shall use technology to work smarter not harder\n- Scribe AI becoming an absolute game changer. Heidi is free and works well. FreedAI is a bit nicer if you wanna spend CME money on it but Heidi alone is enough IMHO for those that want to stick with free. Many others and almost all have a free trial\n- OpenEvidence is free with your NPI and like chat gpt for us\n\n5. Thou shall stay in thy lane\n- PCP PAs use your consultants! We have time to discuss one problem at a time, you don't. I can see a clinic patient for such a problem if Everytime you try he wants to discuss ten other things. Send them over!\n- Consultant PAs stick with what you know best. If you're not comfortable managing something bring in your doc or consult out to sub subspecialty as appropriate\n\n6. Thou shall not be a perfectionist (with care, explanations to patients, notes - self explanatory)\n\n7. Thou shall live and learn. To err is human. Don't beat yourself up, learn and move on. And somon and so forth. \n\n8. Thou shall have fun at work. It's crazy how much drama can stew at the clinic or nurse station. Lighten up! Humor is the best medicine after all. \n\nK guys. I'm really dragging to hit ten tbh. Hope you all enjoyed!",

      "title": "We're waiting 3+ months for a software vendor to tell us if they will support their product on Windows Server 2025",
      "text": "We replaced an on-prem server last fall.  Simple setup with a VM as DC and a VM as File/Print/Application server.  Both run Server 2025.  There is also a totally separate LOB application that the software vendor says must run on a dedicated  VM.\n\nFor 3+ months we have been asking the vendor if they will support running on Windows Server 2025.  They either don't respond at all or say that they will get back to us.  And they never do.  Meanwhile, we continue to run the application on 2012r2 which violates the cyber insurance coverage mandating \"only supported O/Ss\"\n\nLast week I sent another email to the vendor's senior engineer asking about 2025 support.  The response was \"We don't have any customers running it and we haven't tested it.  But will ask the Dev team to follow up.\"  So you're telling me that customers aren't running the software on an O/S that you refuse to test.  Imagine that.\n\nThe vendor has been growing by leaps and bounds and the original owners sold a majority stake to Private Equity.  Since then the support has gone downhill.  The usual story.\n\nIf we have to revert to Server 2022 I guess we will but that seems dumb. Has anyone here seen an application that was OK on Server 2022 but won't run properly on Server 2025?  Looking for some advice.   TIA.\n\nEditing my post to add some context, which I think is important because I'm seeing so many comments that are critical because \"You let things get so bad.\"\n\n\\* This is local government where a Mayor and Council, none of whom have an IT background set the annual budget.   There are two budgets each years: an operating budget, which covers things like salaries, utilities, insurance, etc. and a a second budget for what are called \"capital projects\" that are for new equipment (police cars, truck for public works, and just about anything IT related that costs more than a couple of hundred dollars).\n\n\\* I have no direct contact with the Mayor and Council.  Each year I put in a request to the Town's Administrator who puts together my requests along with the requests for every other department (Police, Public Works, Recreation, Senior Services, etc.) into a spreadsheet of projects.\n\n\\* In mid-2021 I was notified by the server manufacturer that the only server we have (outside of the Police Department, which has its own equipment) would not be eligible for a hardware maintenance agreement after 2022.  In addition, the server was maxed out on storage bays and was running an O/S that was going end-of support in 2023 which would be in violation of the Town's cyber insurance coverage.  All of these factors combined caused me to make a new server and O/S a top priority for 2022.\n\n\\* In 2022 the Town opened a new municipal building that went WAY over the original budget for a variety of reasons including Covid era price increases.  Each department was told that most capital requests for 2022 would be denied.  The server project was nixed.\n\n\\* At the end of 2022, I put the server into the budget request for 2023 citing the same reasons as I did the prior year, this time indicating that the server would already be operating without a hardware maintenance agreement and unless they wanted to take a chance that the server could be down for days (or longer) if there was an equipment failure they really needed to approve the project for 2023.\n\n\\* In 2022, the local election caused a shift in control from one party to the other.   The Town Administrator, who can be fired without cause and was brought in by the party that lost the election, was concerned that he was going to lose his job.\n\n\\* When the Town Administrator put together the list of capital project requests for 2023, he didn't include the server project at all, possibly in an attempt to show how fiscally responsible he was in hopes of saving his job.  He was fired anyway and a new Administrator was hired.\n\n\\* I again pleaded my case for new hardware and software in 2023 to be included in the 2024 budget.  The new Administrator agreed to put the project into the capital budget request for 2024 and that budget was approved late summer/early fall of that year.  There is a statutory waiting period of 4+ weeks before approved money can actually be spent and I was finally given approval to get a purchase order for the new server.  Delivery of the server was in late 2024, almost 3 years after I made it clear that replacing the server was a top priority.\n\n\\* One more fun fact: the \"new\" Administrator was fired and a new person was hired earlier this year.\n\nFun times working in this environment for sure.",

There's the thought that 'well that could be me'. So this leads to people working on side projects out side of work etc, because 'I just need to be better than the other developers, then I can I get the 500K job'. Great for the employers. \n- We've probably all worked with other software developers who we thnk aren't particularly good, and there's a thought that the purpose of a union/association/guild shouldn't be to uphold mediocre standards. \n- I think agile is suffocating the profession. It's before my time, but I think previously software developers had more power in determining how things got done, because they were able to get together and plan it out. Now, it's all broken down into Jira tickets and the developer is just assigned 'do this thing'. It means we get shoddy solutions and the job sucks. \n\n",

      "text": "Congratulations to all of class of 2025!!!! 🎉\n\nI recently graduated from a BSN program, and I never thought I would make it this far. If you’re doubting yourself, this message is for you. I failed one semester, took two semesters to finish one, and got held back semester due to a med dosage exam (that wasn’t my fault), and had a mass in my groin and was able to make it this far! But, I couldn’t do it by myself. I had family, friends, colleagues, and faculty who helped pave the way for me. No I did NOT graduate with a 4.0, I actually finished with a 2.5 nursing school gpa and that’s okay. And this is a reminder for my future self and you guys to let you know that YOU CAN DO IT!! I’m not the smartest or brightest and would even spend weeks to study to just get a 70 on an exam, but I got through. Here are small little tokens:\n\n- Find a way to study! For me it was videos. I would make sure to write every little detail. A 30 minute video suddenly became a 2.5 hr session but at least I came out knowing the pathophysiology and nursing care. Yes I didn’t like it but it what was worked for me. Some might be using the PowerPoint or audio and that’s okay. Someone else’s way of learning doesn’t mean it has to be yours.\n\n- Talk with people. Friend/study groups helped me incase I missed any small details or just be able to discuss the topics. Teach-back method helps solidify your understanding. \n\n- Get a job if you can in the specialty you want to work in the future. This helped me build my confidence and skills. I had teachers and faculty put me down due to my scores being low meaning idk nursing skills and won’t ever be a nurse. Guess what? Holyairball. Getting a job helped with networking and being able to prove to myself that I can do this!! Also, get a job in the specialty you want work after graduation but mainly for ED or ICU. Not very common to get these roles if you don’t have the “experience.” In my case I landed it but it’s very rare. Getting a job helped me also gave me confidence to work with my clinical instructor than just shadowing. It helped me create relationships with people and to get out of my comfort zone.\n\n- Your grades DO NOT DEFINE YOU!! Yes it’s good to have good grades, but I’ve seen many people who have good grades that fail clinically and vice versa. Don’t sell yourself short. YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES!!!\n\n- Take care of yourself. Health is wealth. It’s easy to say but not easy to do. Find what helps you heal or relax. For me it’s family time and binge watching, for others it’s going to the gym or going out. Find what works for you.\n\n- Build your time management skills. If you manage your time well; you will be able to find that you can work, study, and relax. Also these skills translate to your work in the future. \n\n- Always take practice exams. For me I knew the concepts and pathology of disease processes. But because I didn’t do practice questions and tests, I was always was a poor test taker. Yes it might not help you at work, but it will help prepare you for the NCLEX and how to understand the question and not overthink it. \n\nI hope this helps someone out there. Incoming classes, you guys got this!!!! Good luck future nurses!!",

Use free resources like YouTube if you need a better explanation. Read your PowerPoints from lectures. Read the book. Relisten to lectures. Study with friends to come up with stupid ways to remember info. \n\nAnd use the resources your school gives you that you’re already paying for! My program included the Saunders NCLEX prep book that came with practice questions on Elsevier. For the NCLEX I studied that book and did those questions. I wrote notes in the book for the rationales of questions I got wrong to review. I googled a list of common meds on the exam. I watched a free NCLEX review on YouTube. That’s it. I spent 2 weeks very casually reviewing. You don’t need a 6 week study plan 8 hours a day if you did well in school. Trust yourself that the knowledge is in there somewhere! \n\nI just wanted to give those that are worried some reassurance. If you’re tight on cash or just find the concept of spending MORE money ridiculous, you can still do well with what you’re given. ",

      "text": "It really is incredible how suddenly the world changes. Many of us are now unemployed, facing layoffs, taking salary cuts and enduring grueling work environments to try and get through the worst tech recession since 2008.\n\nI myself now work in a fusty, old and stable government department in Europe.\n\nBut I once worked for a couple of 2010s ZIRP startups. And what places they were.\n\nPeople from across Europe and the world would rock up to these places and bring their seductive cocktail of cultural insight, experiences and languages. And they were motivated primarily to create something new and cool. The types who would have hated the fusty corporate offices that many of us now flee to in search of job security.\n\nAnd the energy was explosive. Sure most of their companies didn't make much profit or, in many cases, even  revenue - but the magic was palpable. Not least because the company socials brought together so many people from different cultures and countries.\n\nLove, friendships (and even startup founder partnerships) were forged in these places. And this magic was often sparked overseas at global socials that the startups flew everyone to so that we could all party in foreign lands. I myself was flown to New York alongside everyone else in the London office to party for three days. It was crazy.\n\nMuch of that magic was captured in photographs that disappeared not long before those bankruptcies were declared.\n\nMany of those people have since moved on to more sensible lives, corporate jobs and the bright beginnings of early middle age.\n\nBut for a moment, it was magic.",

They will regularly announce it on their website or newsletter. \n* Have your career advisor look over your resume and try to get a mock interview\n\nI wish you all the best of luck in school and finding jobs!",

Sure this is high when you compare this with the average salary of people in other jobs is only around 200USD. You don’t get into it for the money right, but then how are you supposed to feed your family, take care of self and make support for the ward. Respect and dignity don’t feed you. \n\nAlso the violence against doctors in India is ridiculously high. I have seen doctors beat up, i have even broken up a fight during intern period. I was attacked once by a patient who tried to stab me with a glass shard because the govt didn’t think it was necessary to offer security services with in the premises. Also we get only 12 days of leave which cannot be taken more than 4 days continuously.

The things she described were incredibly twisted and far from the truth and what I stand for as a teacher. I don’t even have any way to defend myself since the e-mail wasn’t addressed to me. I even saw the mom in school that day and she was smiling at me as if nothing had happened and when I told her I’m always available to speak, she showed no interest. \n\nI have been doing anonymous student feedback and never heard about the issues mentioned in the email. I feel so terrible, my teaching reputation has been hindered and I have no way of defending myself. \n\nUpdate: Thanks to everyone for your compassion. I still have a lot of resilience to build. The principal was very reasonable and I had another chance to explain my perspective. She also said she does plan to do observations next school year. She will try to schedule a meeting with the mother in September with me and another person present. My salary will be reduced this month due to this incident, because otherwise she would have to put this into my file.🙄 I foster cats and use a lot of my own money for saving them so thanks to these privileged rich people for reducing my salary to even less🤦‍♀️\n\nUpdate 2: had a meeting with the mom and the principal. It was terrible and full of insults and hate adressed towards me. Clarifying my good intentions was of no help as this was seen just as empty excuses and I was still seen as a villain by the end of the meeting. I cried during most of it and was told to just sit quiet and listen. - that speaking up for myself would actually confirm the bad accusations. The mother also did not want to shake hands with me and gave an evil glare instead.

Then on compensation expectations the recruiter said, “You mentioned $150K earlier.” I clarified that I was targeting the upper end based on my fit and experience. They responded with, “So $180K?” and I just said yes. It felt a bit like putting words in my mouth.\n\nNext day, I got an email saying that I have to wait for the offer decision as they are interviewing  other candidates. Haven’t heard back since. I don’t think I did anything fundamentally wrong or if I should have regrets but curious what others think.\n\nEdit: Just to clarify, in my mind I thought that’s how negotiations work.

      "text": "Hey all,\n\nIm 7 YOE. I have worked in the defense industry my first few years (RTX, Lockheed Martin, BAE, etc), then during the hiring height of 2020-2022 I went to FAANG-level company and spent a few years there in their cloud based system. THis year I got laid off and after a few months I was able to get a job in a big tech cloud based system. I wouldnt consider my current company FAANG level but id say most people would know it. I will pre-face this that it is my experience. Im not saying every project in each industry is like this, I've known people in AWS who claim to not have to do anything past 5 pm and get great reviews and bonuses.  I know people in defense who say they work a shitload of hours to get things done.\n\nHere are some of the differences I've seen from all three jobs:\n\n# Onboarding:\n\nDefense - didnt really have an onboarding. It was just kind of, build and run the system. I remember they gave me a task to change the headers of a few files just as an excuse to get me to build.\n\nFAANG - they bascially gave me an onboarding doc, that didnt even seem official. It was just a doc that got passed around with steps. I was surpriused nobody had ever took time to put it in a version control style doc system. It was just in the middle of some doc sharing system online.\n\nCurrent: to my surprise their onboarding was the best and most chill. They gave me clear indiciation of where they expect me to be. The first week was just 3 hour courses each day of onboarding for my company. The second week was a self paced class for onboarding for my team. The videos were very instructive, and easy to follow along and my favorite part was they basically gave us guidelines for how to get promoted.\n\n# work life balance:\n\nDefense - probably had the best work life balance of the bunch. I never had to think about work after 5pm. By 6 the building was a ghost town with a few stragglers. They worked on a 9/80 schedule so I had 3 day weekends 2-3 times a month (26 times a year). I could also work for extra PTO, where if I worked extra hours one week I could save it in a \"extra time\" bank and use it as future PTO.\n\nFAANG - definetely the worse of the 3 so far. It was expected ot be available practically 24/7. I went to that FAANG company because I had heard it was one of the few that you coould have a life, but I never realized that cloud was the exception to that rule. People were respodning to emails late at night, getting on calls late, responding on vacation, etc. THey were cool about taking time off but it felt like if you weren't drinking the kool aid and doing 10x more like verybody else was doing, it wouldnt go well for you.\n\nCurrent - still early to tell but it seems that there isnt as much of a \"work late\" culture here. People set their own times, some work a bit later but Ive never seen any crazy discussions happen at 11 pm like I did in my last job. A few principal engineers have gone on vacation and not yet have I seen any of them get on a call or message thread to answer any type of question.\n\n# Expectiations:\n\nDefense - really didnt have much expectations. I practically worked 20 hours, coasted the rest, was my team's scrum master, etc and over excelled in their eyes. There was no real due date on things because contracts in defense last multiple years. I remember when I got there the expectation was to complete the project within my first year. It took 3 years to finish and nobody batted an eye.\n\nFAANG - expectations were very high. If you were finishin up with a major task, theyd throw another one at you before you were even done with the first. Seemed even as aJr/mid-level I was expected to lead meetings, always be available, etc. I worked way more at this job than I did at defense and felt like i was underperforming because if I did 8-10 hours, most others did 10-12 hour days. In reviews it seemed like I was compared to my teammates, not so much compared to what the expectation of the job was.\n\nCurrent - again still early. But seems like their expectations are pretty fair. A quote from the first day I like was \"if you want to be the person that does 40 hour weeks and gets your job done, you can have a long career here. If you want to be the person that does 50+ hour weeks here for that quicker promotion, you can do that but just respect your work-life balance\".\n\n# Time and meetings:\n\nDefense - hardly had any meetings. We did standup evertday (except fridays) for 30 minutes but it mostly lasted 15 minutes. We hardly went over. I never learned the concept of parking lot until I got to FAANG lol. It was in office so just walking to someone's desk was really just the norm.\n\nFAANG - seemed like if your day didnt have 4 hours of meetings, you were underperforming. Everything was a discussion. Parking lot would take an extra hour and most of it was discussing things that I felt didnt really have to take that long. At times some of my tasks were pushed back due to someone wanting to discuss about one simple change. If you had to talk to someone, it was hard to get them on a call and when you did they didnt appreciate their time being wasted. In meetings it seemed everyone was stressed to have the meeting finish.\n\nCurrent - seems nobody is really stressed about meetings. Parking lot items get resolved pretty quickly. Everybody doesn't mind hopping on a call and lasting an hour with you.\n\nEdit: someone asked for interview styles. I wont give exact details but ill say more or less how it was.\n\n# Interview:\n\nDefense: I was a college grad so I got invited to an all day hriing event by the company. It seemed like the interviews didnt ask anything technical, they jsut wanted to get ot know me. At the end of the day they had me list my favorite teams and told me theyd let me know. I've interviewed for other defense companies, tbh there were no leetcode questions or anything like that. Technical questions were more like \"what is OOP?\" or how I would design a simple code.\n\nFAANG - first was a pre-round codesignal style question to see if I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that I went through 2-3 rounds of interviews asking leetcode style questions and then a manager meet.\n\nBig tech - similar to faang. Pre-interview exam to make sure I knew what I was doing. Once I passed that it was 2-3 rounds of code/system questions.\n\nEdit 2: people asked about TC\n\n# TC\n\n\\- Defense: as a college grad in a HCOL state I started at about 78k wiht a 5k bonus. Within 4 years and 1 promotion I was making 90k and yearly bonuses that was around 5k-8k.  No stock. I know people who jumped to other defense company and they are around 120k. Promotion seemed like it happened every 2-3 years.\n\n\\- FAANG - I never got promoted in my few years though I doubt I deserved it in their eyes. I never really saw anybody get promoted really. Like one mid level SWE had been working more than most seniors and she didnt get promoted. AS for TC it was about 220k between base stocks and signing bonus. I moved to a low COL state shortly after joining and my base pay dropped by 20k so it ended up being around 200k\n\n\\- Current company - TC is about 200k with just basepay and stock (no signing bonus) but according to them, im promised up to 10% bonus that would bring my total pay to around 215k.\n\n# Benefits\n\n\\- Defense: 3 weeks of accrued PTO. But since there was timsheet we technically were not allowed to do overtime. A work around was if I worked 90 hours in a 2 week period, I could use 10 hours and save it in a special bank that I could use later on. So If in a 4 week period I worked 200 hours, I could set 40 hours to that special bank. And if I had a 2week vacation I could use the special bank for the first week and my regular PTO for the second week. It was good benefits outside of that, tuition reimbursement which I used to get my master's degree without taking on more debt. Discounts on personal travel (it wasnt amazing but good enough) etc.\n\n\\- FAANG - Unlimited PTO. Some of the best benefits i've ever seen will probably will ever have. There were multiple different types of reimbursement programs for almost anything. Discount codes on almost any store that were actually pretty good discounts. Similar benefits when it comes to tuition reimbursement, etc.\n\n\\- Big tech - unlimited PTO. Again good benefits, just not as good as FAANG. Company will give random 3 day weekends to employees that they announce pretty early so people have it prepared.",

      "text": "I've been in IT for 5 years with a BS degree and I'm currently making $55k. My goal is to reach around $80k, but I'm starting to wonder how realistic this is in today's job market.\n\nFrom what I've observed, the IT field seems increasingly saturated. I didn't go into this field because I'm passionate about tech - I don't play video games in my free time, and if it were up to me, I wouldn't touch technology outside of work. I chose IT as a practical career path, but the industry seems to be favoring those who are tech enthusiasts.\n\nI'm wondering about others' experiences trying to advance in IT without making it your entire identity. Is it still possible to reach $80k for someone who sees IT as just a job rather than a passion? How long did it take you to reach that salary level, and what was your path to get there?\n\nI dont meant to say I didnt expect this career to take work. Of course any field takes work to get promoted.. But with entry and mid positions getting incredibly saturated the expectations are rising. I never got into this field to be rich, but to live comfortably enough to own a home, travel a bit, and raise a small family. That doesnt feel in reach currently and with the trajectory of the market it doesnt seem like things will get easier.\n\nedit:  \nI live in Raleigh NC\n\nMy background\n\nBS in IT Management/Cybersecurity (2019), CompTIA Security+ (2022)\n\n* IT Intern at community college (4 months)\n* Help Desk Specialist (contract, 2 months)\n* Tech Support Tier 1 (10 months)\n* Tech Support Tier 2 (3.5 years)\n* Current: Director of IT (inflated title) at a school (7 months) - managing Chromebooks, ticketing system, IT policies, and support\n\nedit: I am not saying I hate It. I just dont go home and tinker with computers in my free time for fun. My passions make no money. Art, music, running, cycling, photography... I had to choose a career that made money and tech just made sense to me. I dont want to set up servers or play with networks in my free time though, unless its necessary career development.\n\nsaying find a job your actually passionate about doesnt work for everyone.",

      "title": "Ace The Interview - SQL Intuitively and Exhaustively Explained",
      "text": "SQL is easy to learn and hard to master. Realistically, the difficulty of the questions you get will largely be dictated by the job role you're trying to fill.\n\nFrom it's highest level, SQL is a \"declarative language\", meaning it doesn't define a set of operations, but rather a desired end result. This can make SQL incredibly expressive, but also a bit counterintuitive, especially if you aren't fully aware of it's declarative nature.\n\nSQL expressions are passed through an SQL engine, like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and others. Thes engines parse out your SQL expressions, optimize them, and turn them into an actual list of steps to get the data you want. While not as often discussed, for beginners I recommend SQLite. It's easy to set up in virtually any environment, and allows you to get rocking with SQL quickly. If you're working in big data, I recommend also brushing up on something like PostgreSQL, but the differences are not so bad once you have a solid SQL understanding.\n\nIn being a high level declaration, SQL’s grammatical structure is, fittingly, fairly high level. It’s kind of a weird, super rigid version of English. SQL queries are largely made up of:\n\n* **Keywords:** special words in SQL that tell an engine what to do. Some common ones, which we’ll discuss, are `SELECT, FROM, WHERE, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, JOIN, ORDER BY, GROUP BY` . They can be lowercase or uppercase, but usually they’re written in uppercase.\n* **Identifiers:** Identifiers are the names of database objects like tables, columns, etc.\n* **Literals:** numbers, text, and other hardcoded values\n* **Operators:** Special characters or keywords used in comparison and arithmetic operations. For example `!=`, `&lt;` ,`OR`, `NOT` , `*`, `/`, `%` , `IN`, `LIKE` . We’ll cover these later.\n* **Clauses:** These are the major building block of SQL, and can be stitched together to combine a queries general behavior. They usually start with a keyword, like \n   * `SELECT` – defines which columns to return \n   * `FROM` – defines the source table \n   * `WHERE` – filters rows \n   * `GROUP BY` – groups rows etc.  \n\nBy combining these clauses, you create an SQL query\n\nThere are a ton of things you can do in SQL, like create tables:\n\n    CREATE TABLE People(first_name, last_name, age, favorite_color)\n\nInsert data into tables:\n\n    INSERT INTO People\n    VALUES\n        ('Tom', 'Sawyer', 19, 'White'),\n        ('Mel', 'Gibson', 69, 'Green'),\n        ('Daniel', 'Warfiled', 27, 'Yellow')\n\nSelect certain data from tables:\n\n    SELECT first_name, favorite_color FROM People\n\nSearch based on some filter\n\n    SELECT * FROM People WHERE id = 3\n\nAnd Delete Data\n\n    DELETE FROM People WHERE age &lt; 30 \n\nWhat was previously mentioned makes up the cornerstone of pretty much all of SQL. Everything else builds on it, and there is a lot.\n\n**Primary and Foreign Keys**  \nA *primary key* is a unique identifier for each record in a table. A *foreign key* references a primary key in another table, allowing you to relate data across tables. This is the backbone of relational database design.\n\n**Super Keys and Composite Keys**  \nA *super key* is any combination of columns that can uniquely identify a row. When a unique combination requires multiple columns, it’s often called a *composite key* — useful in complex schemas like logs or transactions.\n\n**Normalization and Database Design**  \nNormalization is the process of splitting data into multiple related tables to reduce redundancy. First Normal Form (1NF) ensures atomic rows, Second Normal Form (2NF) separates logically distinct data, and Third Normal Form (3NF) eliminates derived data stored in the same table.\n\n**Creating Relational Schemas in SQLite**  \nYou can explicitly define tables with `FOREIGN KEY` constraints using `CREATE TABLE`. These relationships enforce referential integrity and enable behaviors like cascading deletes. SQLite enforces `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE` constraints strictly, making your schema more robust.\n\n**Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**  \nERDs visually represent tables and their relationships. Dotted lines and cardinality markers like `{0,1}` or `0..N` indicate how many records in one table relate to another, which helps document and debug schema logic.\n\n**JOINs**  \nJOIN operations combine rows from multiple tables using foreign keys. `INNER JOIN` includes only matched rows, `LEFT JOIN` includes all from the left table, and `FULL OUTER JOIN` (emulated in SQLite) combines both. Proper JOINs are critical for data integration.\n\n**Filtering and LEFT/RIGHT JOIN Differences**  \nJOIN order affects which rows are preserved when there’s no match. For example, using `LEFT JOIN` ensures all left-hand rows are kept — useful for identifying unmatched data. SQLite lacks `RIGHT JOIN`, but you can simulate it by flipping the table order in a `LEFT JOIN`.\n\n**Simulating FULL OUTER JOINs**  \nSQLite doesn’t support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but you can emulate it with a `UNION` of two `LEFT JOIN` queries and a `WHERE` clause to catch nulls from both sides. This approach ensures no records are lost in either table.\n\n**The WHERE Clause and Filtration**  \n`WHERE` filters records based on conditions, supporting logical operators (`AND`, `OR`), numeric comparisons, and string operations like `LIKE`, `IN`, and `REGEXP`. It's one of the most frequently used clauses in SQL.\n\n**DISTINCT Selections**  \nUse `SELECT DISTINCT` to retrieve unique values from a column. You can also select distinct combinations of columns (e.g., `SELECT DISTINCT name, grade`) to avoid duplicate rows in the result.\n\n**Grouping and Aggregation Functions**  \nWith `GROUP BY`, you can compute metrics like `AVG`, `SUM`, or `COUNT` for each group. `HAVING` lets you filter grouped results, like showing only departments with an average salary above a threshold.\n\n**Ordering and Limiting Results**  \n`ORDER BY` sorts results by one or more columns in ascending (`ASC`) or descending (`DESC`) order. `LIMIT` restricts the number of rows returned, and `OFFSET` lets you skip rows — useful for pagination or ranked listings.\n\n**Updating and Deleting Data**  \n`UPDATE` modifies existing rows using `SET`, while `DELETE` removes rows based on `WHERE` filters. These operations can be combined with other clauses to selectively change or clean up data.\n\n**Handling NULLs**  \n`NULL` represents missing or undefined values. You can detect them using `IS NULL` or replace them with defaults using `COALESCE`. Aggregates like `AVG(column)` ignore NULLs by default, while `COUNT(*)` includes all rows.\n\n**Subqueries**  \nSubqueries are nested `SELECT` statements used inside `WHERE`, `FROM`, or `SELECT`. They’re useful for filtering by aggregates, comparisons, or generating intermediate results for more complex logic.\n\n**Correlated Subqueries**  \nThese are subqueries that reference columns from the outer query. Each row in the outer query is matched against a custom condition in the subquery — powerful but often inefficient unless optimized.\n\n**Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  \nCTEs let you define temporary named result sets with `WITH`. They make complex queries readable by breaking them into logical steps and can be used multiple times within the same query.\n\n**Recursive CTEs**  \nRecursive CTEs solve hierarchical problems like org charts or category trees. A base case defines the start, and a recursive step extends the output until no new rows are added. Useful for generating sequences or computing reporting chains.\n\n**Window Functions**  \nWindow functions perform calculations across a set of table rows related to the current row. Examples include `RANK()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `SUM() OVER ()`, and moving averages with sliding windows.\n\nThese all can be combined together to do a lot of different stuff.\n\nIn my opinion, this is too much to learn efficiently learn outright. It requires practice and the slow aggregation of concepts over many projects. If you're new to SQL, I recommend studying the basics and learning through doing. However, if you're on the job hunt and you need to cram, you might find this breakdown useful: [https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively](https://iaee.substack.com/p/structured-query-language-intuitively)",

      "text": "So I work at a trauma hospital in radiology . And it seems like every few months, our lead tech finds a new coworker to hate on and talk bS about to other departments . So to paint a good picture - she isn’t the best “leader” to us.  So recently  A few coworkers and I have been under the suspicion that our lead tech has been recording our convos every time she steps out of the room. We noticed she’d bring up convos that she was never included in and it would make us wonder how she knew this info. Everytime she leaves the work office that we all sit in, she flips her phone face-down and “hides” it. \n\nSo one day, she left the room for a long time and had her phone face down and I kept hearing a phone ringing and vibrating and thought it was coming from her phone so I flipped it over to see if it was hers, turns out her voice memo was open and on record the whole time. \nI know for a fact we talked about patient information while she’s been secretly recording us . So now I know I’m not paranoid \n\nAlso I can’t go to my manager about this because they are both really close to one another . And im afraid if we all take this to HR she will only get a slap on the wrist or written up and then she will still be our lead tech and know what we did and still continue to make working with her very awkward and weird . \n\nSo my question is … does this violate hippa and was it illegal for her to be recording us without our consent? Also how do I go about this now that I know? Do I contact HR? Do I need to get proof? How do I get proof? \n\nThe state I live in says wiretapping law is a \"one-party consent\" law. (State) makes it a crime to intentionally intercept any wire, oral or \"electronic communication\" to overhear or record a phone call or conversation unless one party consents to the conversation.",

      "title": "LIneman in South Korea",
      "text": "Hello! I'm someone working as a lineman in South Korea. I became curious about how linemen work overseas, so I searched and ended up here.\n\nIn the case of the United States, since the supply voltage is different from Korea, I thought the work might be different as well, so I have a lot of questions. After reading through the posts, I noticed that the most fundamental difference seems to be that. In Korea, outdoor work without using aerial work vehicles is strictly prohibited. We are not allowed to perform work on utility poles with wearing fall protection gear. Two years ago, there were too many falling accidents, so Korea's public utility company, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), enforced this ban.\n\nIt’s probably due to differences in industrial structure and culture. Korea’s power market is regulated by the government and is not privatized. Therefore, Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) is responsible for the electricity supply across the entire country. For new installations, demolitions, maintenance, and other projects, they outsource the work to partner companies like the one I work for. So, field workers in outdoor construction cannot decide on the work methods autonomously.\n\nAlso, in Korea, 90% of the work is done as \"live-line\" work, meaning without cutting off the power. Because of this, when working on 22.9kV high-voltage lines, the only possible method is to use insulated sticks to work from a distance. The work of directly touching high-voltage lines with insulated gloves was prohibited three years ago.\n\nI’m not sure about overseas, but in Korea, there is a specific process to become a lineman. You start as a ground-level assistant doing general tasks, then move on to work on utility poles while wearing fall protection gear, and finally, you get trained to operate aerial work vehicles to become a lineman. Due to the ban on working with fall protection gear, it has become really difficult for new workers, or apprentices, to learn the job in Korea.\n\nFortunately, I’m transitioning to a new company where I’ll be responsible for aerial work vehicles starting next year, becoming an 'live-line' worker, even though I had to give up better conditions to join a company with worse ones. Currently, in Korea, if you want to become a lineman, you have to give up living like a normal person for the first few years, hahaha\n\nIn Korea, a ground-level assistant worker earns $223 for a 10-hour day(not 8hrs lol). Linemen without their own aerial work vehicles earn $373 a day, while linemen with their own aerial work vehicles earn $746. These amounts are based on the current broken exchange rate in South Korea.\n\nAlso, the salaries above are for a small number of freelancers who are members of labor unions. The majority of workers are full-time employees at subcontractor companies of Korea Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO), with entry-level workers earning $1,700/month, mid-level workers earning $2,700, and senior linemen earning around $7,800. ...I want to go abroad....\n\nIf you have any questions, free to ask. My English isn't that great, so there might be some mistranslations here and there! If my English level improves, I would love to work in a country like yours, but realistically, it might be impossible, right? lol\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/dr15ympnnk9e1.jpg?width=2992&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1a353b87aea7e199dee35cdf7e5d142ae578004a\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/p834vppnnk9e1.jpg?width=1800&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c32c69d4ab0190dda81028f3bd444ac343c589a8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/jz6pappnnk9e1.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69cca81a786755d40024abca5c37d198f364d844\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/c21dfqpnnk9e1.jpg?width=3024&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=785922577ede0d1706758ef0240a23aae506badf\n\n",

      "text": "Good Morning Everyone,\n\n\nAs part of our new community outreach program, I'm excited to make our first reddit post and begin our ongoing dialogue. As we've interacting with clinicians in the beginning of 2025, we've heard about the numerous challenges you've been facing. The cuts to reimbursements, the interactions you've had with other types of providers, and the concerns over the financial health of the profession. We know how stressful this can be, especially now with more uncertainty regarding the overall economy. I personally see this everyday when interacting with the clinicians in my local area.\n\nAnd many of you have asked, how does the APTA plan to react to this?\n\nRest assured, we've already begun taking action to make things better. In March, we ordered top of the line Herman-Miller office chairs for the new building, so employees can turn easier as to not have to look at what we call \"the poor side of the building\" where the Athletico is in view. Second, we hired my niece to do fun Tik-Tok dances and tag #PTcanBFun to help boost morale and improve social outreach. We expect this to increase the referrals to your clinic dramatically.\n\nWe've also come up with a comprehensive new budgeting tool to help PT's address their financial debts. We're proud to be partnering with DoorDash, in a program were calling \"oh by the way\", which we think will increase the awareness of the PT profession and help people #ChoosePT. APTA members should expect a detailed email in the coming days, with the general population probably hearing about it on the news in the coming weeks.\n\nBut remember, it won't be for the weak! #Grit\n\n-APTA",

We have finally added the Actuary roles to the site - **see / add salaries here:** [**https://www.levels.fyi/t/actuary?countryId=254&amp;country=254**](https://www.levels.fyi/t/actuary?countryId=254&amp;country=254)\n\nThis has taken a while because we do things fairly manually to ensure the data remains clean. This means there's been a ton of prep work to ensure we understand the role, different sub-specialties of the role, adjacent roles, leveling at companies for the role, etc. I've spoken with a few of you in this subreddit and reached out to several folks on LinkedIn in my research.\n\nIt's not perfect still - we are working on adding certifications to the site (which I know is a big deal for actuaries). That will take a few months though and I didn't want to block the launch on that given knowing pay by company + level is super helpful to people already.For now you can add your certifications in the 'Other Details' field on the [salary submission form](https://www.levels.fyi/salaries/add). If you know the [Actuary career levels](https://www.levels.fyi/t/actuary?countryId=254&amp;compare=Nationwide%2CThe+Hartford%2CErnst+and+Young%2CMercer) for your company please [add it here](https://www.levels.fyi/create.html) or DM me!\n\nI hope we can make pay more transparent and fair for Actuary roles as we've done with engineering roles. Please lmk if you have any other feedback!",

So I sit outside in the car while she does her 2 sessions back to back. Her speech is 30 mins and her OT is an hour long. So they called me in 10 mins early to pick her up I thought something happened. I walked in and my daughter was laid asleep across her therapist chest and it was the sweetest thing ever. She said she did good today but she was just a little grumpy &amp; fussy and she was tired. It was just the cutest thing ever. I really appreciate her speech and occupational therapists. They really understand my daughter and don’t overstimulate her and let her take breaks when needed. Seeing my daughter so comfortable with someone she just met a few weeks ago was such a positive sign to see. She has been really doing so much better after her sessions I wish I would’ve put her in therapy a lot sooner but nonetheless, I just want to say I really appreciate all the hard work you guys do. You guys are a safe and soft spot for a lot of these kids and your hard work never goes unnoticed. 🩷",

I immediately get that sinking feeling. Really it's disbelief at this point. How??? \n\nI have been at my current agency two years and have never, not once, not even have I *imagined* refusing an order to stay over. Mandatory. Force, whatever it's called where you are.\n\nNot one but TWO people above me on the list say no. One of them is only here 9 months. The other just over two years. They do this frequently. Neither of them work tonight like I do. They don't give a fuck. They are going home to a nice warm bed while I will have to do an 8 hour turnaround when I live 45 minutes away for my 4th 12 in a row after a 16. \n\nI hate the fact that we are so short staffed that management knows they can't enforce the refusal rules to the letter or they will lose another 25% of the staff. These insensitive and callous people have learned that. Last year when things were staffed they would be looking down the barrel of a 3 day suspension. Not now. So the people like me who care and will do anything to not have \"refuses orders\" on their name and reputation get fucked over again and again.\n\nIt gets old. I refused OT one time in my career and that was on Christmas morning to stay for a double when I had just done 32 hours of OT to be bottom of the list and it STILL got to me. 14 people refused before me. I still hate that I have that one on me but I was not missing Xmas morning with my kids for those assholes.\n\nIt gets old and I am tired.

The only training I received from the company was sales tactics and how to condem systems. I got into the trades because Im a social person and enjoy helping by providing good service. \nWell now I'm starting off at a Ma n Pop shop where everyone seems to be legitimate service techs (so far) and I'm actually getting an apprenticeship style training. That first job was good exposure and I definitely had to hit the ground running. Sales training helped me have those uncomfortable conversations with some customers but in the end I guess that part of the industry doesn't align with my morals. I understand sales is what grows business and revenue. Commercial is great but residential is more my thing. Helping someone and feeling good about. Maybe I'm crazy but I'm sure there's still tons of $$$ to be made through honest work \n\nTLDR: Left my first HVAC job because ridiculous up selling and premature condemning doesn't feel ethical.

His oral health had always been solid, but when he came in that time, everything had changed. I won’t go into all the personal details, but life hit him hard. He lost a long-term partner and his job all within a month. You could see the toll it took—not just emotionally, but physically, and especially in his mouth. The neglect was clear. It broke my heart.\n\nHe told me he had “tried everything” but nothing was working. Same story, different day. Six months ago, I decided to have a real talk with him. I downloaded a toothbrushing timer app on his phone right then and there, and explained that he needed to start treating his whole mouth, not just brushing one side. (The tartar buildup was only on one side—seriously!)\n\nThis week, he came back… and I’m not exaggerating—his oral health has completely turned around. I’ve only seen this kind of transformation a few times in my 8-year career. His gums were healthier, plaque was minimal, and for the first time in a long time, he smiled with confidence.\n\nHere’s what really got me: he thanked me 😭 He said that one little push helped him start pulling himself out of his funk. He showed me a 164-day brushing streak on his phone (better mouth app). He said it became part of his routine and gave him something to feel good about every day. It helped him get out of that dark place.\n\nDental health *is* mental health. We do so much more than just clean teeth. So to all my fellow RDHs: take those extra 5 minutes to talk home care. Think about what your patient’s going through in the six months between appointments. We have the POWER to change lives! \n\nWhat a way to start a Monday.",

      "text": "Just need to vent. I am 12+ years into my PT career, outpatient ortho, and pelvic floor for the last 5. I am so tired. Just weary on a deep, soul level, of being there for, empathizing, supporting, caring, encouraging, coaching patient after patient after patient. I am most distressed that I have no emotional energy left for my own family. Is this career supposed to suck this much???\nI have loved this work but I'm socially exhausted. \n\nEdit: After many prayers, tears, and discussions with my spouse, I have decided to leave my job. I'm very thankful to have accepted another offer and I will be returning back to general outpatient ortho and take an indefinite break from pelvic health. I love the specialty but I've realized I cannot be a pelvic health therapist on a traditional outpatient ortho schedule. My managers have been so amazingly supportive but all the things we've done to improve my work sanity are getting destroyed by my company being bought out and the new regime demanding more productivity. Our big boss thinks we can see 4 patients an hour. I fear they will turn this place into a patient mill, and turn my amazing manager into a stressed out micro-manager. But I have the option to leave. So I am leaving. My hope is to eventually start my own small cash-pay, high quality, holistic wellness and pelvic health PT service, where I can treat patients in a way that helps them optimally AND allows me to be sane and healthy. For now, this new job will be 1:1 general PT, three 10 hour days. I'm praying it will give me a much less emotionally demanding job and let me decompress and recover from burn out. Thank you all for such an outpouring of support and understanding!",

No one says “Man, my hand fracture is making my daily occupations a real bother.” But they might associate the word “function” more commonly with an ailment. I thought “functional therapy” might be a better fit. I know it would be insanely tough to implement this but sometimes a total rebrand can change the course for a business or organization.

I have admits from UIUC Gies (MSF with no scholarship), Johns Hopkins Carey (MSF with 44% scholarship), Stony Brook (MSF with no sch), Rutgers (MQF with no sch), Bentley (MSF with 30% sch and GA Job for 2 semesters), Stevens (MFE with 30% sch), Northeastern (MSQF with 20% sch).\n\nAnyone who has ample idea about the programs, student life, pros and cons at a deeper is more than welcome to share their opinion. My main point of confusion arises from this situation-\n\nI wanted to target top quant programs initially but a lack of programming and math background proved a hurdle, hence I applied to some \"Beyond Top 10\" quant programs like Stevens, Rutgers, and Northeastern. Stevens and NE I am discounting for lack of repute and brand value. Rutgers is still in contention although I haven't received any scholarship.\n\nAdmits from Bentley and Stony can be comparable maybe but Bentley has a weird program and lacks any flexibility. Although, the reported numbers for employment post MSF look strong. SBU is a good name in SUNY schools but I have access to NO DATA about employment, avg salary, % employed at 3m, 6m, etc.\n\nNow, the big guns. UIUC and Johns Hopkins. UIUC allows A LOT of flexibility in MSF, as much as allowing me to take some financial engineering courses. The campus life looks very promising and vibrant. It's almost 6,500 acres. Access to Chicago but no other big city nearby. Brand value better than the colleges mentioned so far, except one. Johns Hopkins. JHU isn't as flexible as UIUC but also not rigid as Bentley. Quant isn't that much of a priority, hard and fast coursework for me. I am opting it only because of good salary. JHU is offering me the Washington DC, right in downtown next to Capitol Hill and the White House. Networking opportunities cross UIUC by a mile (I think). Brand value is immense. No such focus on quant, but instead on public policy related finance. I will target landing think-tank, policy making, govt finance jobs. Is that a viable plan? I’m willing to let go of a pursuit of a quant job hypothetically, because the job types mentioned above are more DC-oriented. But, the business school at JHU isn't THAT well known (I think). I don't know how far will JHU brand tag carry me? Is the downtown DC an ACTUAL plus-point? I've been offered a 44% scholarship but still the fees amount of 53K for the whole thing.\n\nTLDR, 7 uni admits. 2 with brand value, 4 with quant programs, 1 with GA job offer, 1 in NYC, 0 clarity on what to do.

      "text": "I’m not a PT but a PT has changed the trajectory of my dad’s recovery and life so I wanted to just send an encouraging thank you to this profession. \n\nOn September 7th, my mom woke up to find my dad not breathing and without a pulse. She immediately called 911, and the dispatcher walked her through performing CPR until the ambulance arrived.\n\nOn the way to the hospital, the EMTs were able to resuscitate him with CPR and epinephrine, since he wasn’t shockable due to the lack of pulse. He was intubated immediately upon arrival and remained unresponsive, so they began targeted temperature management (cooling and rewarming) to help preserve brain and organ function.\n\nAfter 72 hours, he woke up and recognized me and my mom, and had movement on his left side, but not his right. A CT scan revealed that, on top of the cardiac arrest, he had suffered a brainstem stroke.\n\nHe spent 13 days in the ICU and was later transferred to the stroke unit, where he began physical, occupational, and speech therapy. His speech, swallowing, and cognition came back pretty quickly, but he was still very weak from both the stroke paralysis and being bedridden for nearly a month.\n\n\nDuring this time, the case manager applied for acute rehab. At first, he wasn’t approved because he was too weak. But one of the PTAs working with him asked one of the main rehab PTs to come evaluate him. Despite needing significant assistance, he was able to tolerate 45 minutes of activity.\n\n\nThat PT became his biggest advocate, and thanks to her pushing for him, he was approved for acute rehab. Now he’s making amazing progress, went from struggling to stand with assistance and now is down to minimal assistance with standing and transfers, and currently learning to walk again with a walker, and as of yesterday a cane! \n\n\nThis experience has completely changed how I see physical therapy. The compassion, advocacy, and belief that PTs have in their patients’ potential truly changes lives. Seeing how much of a difference it’s made for my dad has even made me consider a career change into this field, to help others the way these incredible professionals helped him.\n\n\nSo this is really just a thank you to all the PTs, PTAs, and OTs,  who look at the whole picture, who believe in recovery even when the odds seem stacked against someone. You don’t just help people heal, you give them hope and quality of life back.\n\n\n\n\n",

We also surprisingly don’t do layoffs, we’ve never had layoffs even when oil hit negative during covid.\n\n\n\nI currently have 4 years of experience in software and before that I was an electrical engineer with 4 years of experience.

      "text": "**Holy crap, this is long. Congratulations to anyone who reads the whole fuckin thing. We're all narcissists on social media, but this might be a bit much.**  \n**If you're using this to help you go to sleep, you're welcome - let me know how far you made it!**  \n  \n  \nSo, I've got wind that my boss's boss, a new guy, wants to reduce my salary and probably get rid of me. He doesn't know me. He's new. He's not tried to get to know anybody or anything about how we do things, because he's a PE placement whose sole goal is to do whatever it takes to make Line Go Up so they can all get a bit richer in 3-4 years.\n\nI used to run the place, more or less. Seven years ago, I took on a job as a 'Senior Sysadmin' in a team that was one enthusiastic-but-past-it 60-year-old helpdesk person who spent more time cleaning the office than doing IT work, and my boss, our head of IT, Security and Facilities, who was desperately overworked and spread thinner than when you really want a nice piece of toast, but you've run out of butter so you're really scraping up those end pieces to try and .... you get where I'm going.\n\nThey had barely anything. A serviceable network and a datacenter of \\~13 racks (horribly managed, engineers would go in and do what they wanted, the cabling was a disaster) gave Engineering 'sort of' what they needed, but all the departments hated IT and worked around them. No asset management because the helpdesk person had sorted the Excel sheet wrong, saved it over the top of the old one, and not realized for weeks, and so now it was all fucked.  \nThe end user environment was a joke - manually built machines, barely any management (GPOs), no management at all on the Macs. A partial rollout of SentinelOne. People were still using 'Password123' as their passwords because they'd never had to change them.\n\nI went in and rolled up my sleeves. Six months in, my boss quit, and I was given the 'department', with our head of security promoted to CISO/CIO above me. We had already migrated everyone to Intune-joined Windows machines. I'd built a custom asset management system in Quickbase and assessed our whole estate. People had changed their fucking passwords. I was pulling SSO-capable systems into Azure for SSO, which was going down a treat. We had Duo for MFA. We'd migrated to Webex (not my decision - I was given 4 days to do it in the first week back after Christmas, after my boss had fallen out with GoToMeeting).  \nWe were even making progress with other departments.\n\nOh, I forgot to mention that, during this time, I was commuting several hundred miles each week (by plane and bus) and staying on a futon in my boss's barn. I guess I really wanted out of my old job and saw potential here, but man, I was paying for it (literally, because the company did not pay for the travel costs). I should probably also mention that, at the time, I was in the US on an H1-B visa. It was an L1-B, this place paid to change it to employ me. So I was sort of tied to them now. It's also relevant later.\n\nAfter my boss quit and I took on a management position, my partner and I moved to be closer to the office. I had already uprooted my life by moving to the US in the first place, but it was a big deal for her, the first time she'd moved away from family (which turned out to be a good thing).\n\nWe started implementing Jamf Pro just before COVID hit in 2020, so I spent the first couple of months alternately developing a new Mac build and planning out the enrollment of our existing estate, with designing and building a new service desk in JSM (or JSD as it was). This job was giving me a crash course in all sorts of things. My background was in helpdesk and sysadmin for firmly on-premise systems. SaaS was the product my previous employers built, not something I used.\n\nBut now, almost everything was in the cloud. The first few years of this job were, quite frankly, fucking great. It's awful to say, but I enjoyed the pandemic because I had the time and space to sit and learn new things and implement them all, **and get paid for it at home**.\n\nSadly, whilst *my* pay slowly increased, the funding for competent team mates was lacking. I had built out everything we needed to run a really successful, scalable IT department to grow the company (we grew by about 400 in my time there). But I needed good people to run with me, and I could only ever afford juniors who I never had the time to teach, and who were not good self-starters.\n\nMy time became more and more 'managerial' as it was supposed to, but I was also still the senior sys admin, the senior helpdesk, the senior infrastructure guy. I had one fantastic hire who became my infrastructure guy, and I often thanked Cthulu for him, because he did make a meaningful difference in a good way. Everybody else sucked ... or I did.\n\nI've always had imposter syndrome, but doing this job made it crushing. Not only was I rapidly learning, designing, and implementing systems I'd never come across before in a rapidly growing business that never wanted to hear 'No', but I was a manager with zero experience and zero support from the company. I had to fire my first hire after a series of fuck ups, and we sat in the HR manager's office whilst she said nothing, and **I had to fire the poor fucking guy** when I had no idea what to even say. Apparently, I 'did a great job' according to HR, for whatever that's worth 🙂‍↔️\n\nWhen I joined, the plan was a 5-year ramp-up to a team lead position, then manager. That was accelerated to six months, and then I leapt on the treadmill and didn't stop.\n\nI questioned myself *constantly*. Nobody could ever make a decision on anything, no matter how many guidelines we laid down, processes we wrote, or procedures we implemented.\n\nMy boss was not much help. He was (and still is) a lovely guy with tons of industry experience in a lot of different roles. But he's a people pleaser and always tries to make things work. Sadly that leads to a lot of people taking advantage and, as a result, whilst I had someone behind me who would always back me up in a bad situation, for things like 'Getting department heads to agree to something we need them to do' or 'Get us more money before we all kill ourselves', he was kind of terrible.  \nHe repeatedly told me I was doing an awesome job, kept promoting me and giving me more money, but none of it did anything to quiet the voices, nor get me the help that I actually needed!! (I said on more than one occasion, pay me less to get someone good).\n\nJust when things were really ramping up, I found out that I was going to be temporarily unemployed for an undetermined amount of time.\n\nI was applying for my Green Card, and whilst the company was helping me with that (awesome!) they'd neglected to figure out that with my visa expiring and no GC forthcoming, they should have applied for a work authorization several months ago. With the expiration of my visa **in two days**, they were going to have to put me on unpaid leave. (I had been asking for updates on this for weeks ahead of time).\n\nThankfully, the hiatus was only two months in the end, and I was back just before Christmas. I had done some 'consulting' for them which they imbursed me for afterwards along with a bonus to make up for lost earnings which was great, but let me tell you (if you've not been there), watching your bank account rapidly dwindle to zero with no idea when you're going to *be allowed to work again* is a feeling I wouldn't wish on anyone.\n\nWhen I got back, I realized that a manager I had been allowed to hire (for a remote country) had been looking after my helpdesk team just fine in my absence, so I left them with him. I knew we needed to focus on infrastructure, as we'd just paid a lot of money to overhaul our network, and that needed my attention (Networking was also something I'd barely touched before this job, for various reasons).\n\nI'd intended the first half of 2024 to be focused on the new network build-out, and I had the migration of systems onto it earmarked for the spring. Ha. Men, plans, gods, laughing, etc.  \nAt the end of 2023 and the start of 2024, my mother-in-law got very, very sick and sadly passed away in early spring. (FUCK CANCER). Three weeks after our dog. (FUCK CANCER). We spent most of the first half of the year shuttling between cities and living apart, as my wife took care of her mom and I worked remotely when possible so that we could be in the same place. It was a deeply traumatic time, having to literally watch someone waste away and die in front of you (FUCK CANCER), but there was nobody else to run the network project, so on it went.\n\nWhen life returned to \"normal\" I found that, while I'd been in visa-related purgatory, HR had become very interested in our overall IT team (now comprising IT Ops (me), Business Systems, and Security). For some reason, the fact I wasn't in HQ anymore was a big issue. After COVID we had moved further away from the city. I often commuted to our satellite office (where our DC was), but there was no reason for me to be in HQ. However, there became this sort of weird witch hunt where one particular member of HR (who never tried to understand what my job actually was) seemed to be coming after me, as a way to get to my boss.\n\nAt one point, the day after my mother-in-law's memorial (along with our dog's), an engineering team piled on me because their computers had rebooted due to a delayed update. I think it was then that the fuse that I'd been dragging behind me for years, that had been lit somehow, somewhere in the not-so-distant past, caught up to me and exploded. Driving my car home, I screamed until my throat was raw. There was a moment where I very nearly just ran it straight into the concrete median. Once home, I just had a full-on breakdown. At one point, I barely knew what my name was. A few hours later, my wife and I had a deep heart-to-heart, I started going to therapy, but I didn't change my job ...\n\nWhile *those* shenanigans were going on, we discovered that our data center providers were shutting down because they were effectively going out of business. Rather than cut our losses and spend the next six months planning and executing a data center migration, my boss spent the six weeks of it trying to engineer various scenarios by which we'd stay in place. When all of that fell through, we now had considerably less time to do the planning and the executing.\n\nOnce we signed a deal with a place another few weeks in, I was also told that finance would really love it if we could cut down on the amount of racks we're using, so that it costs less.\n\nThat's how I ended up, almost single-handedly, replacing 250 servers and storage systems with \\~10% new servers (there was a lot left in that year's Capex), and planning the move. We were told that \"Engineering can give us one week\" (the week before Christmas), so everything had to go perfectly. The company's next release was **contingent** on having it back up before Christmas. Ignore the fact that the fucking release was already 18 months delayed, but sure, make it *our* fault if it's late again 🙄  \nI didn't see my wife much for a good 5-6 weeks. 8-8 days were common, 8-10 were rare but not unheard of. Seeing as we hadn't gotten to the network migration, I was doing a server replacement/upgrade **and** network migration at the same time. Two birds, one very tired stone. At one point, I looked down after a very difficult switch installation in the back of a rack (tight PDU clearance) and saw that my arm was covered in blood. I guess I'd nicked something inside the rack. Thankfully, it looked worse than it was, but it made me think about how nobody outside of IT realizes how much of our ***literal*** blood, sweat, and tears we put into this shit sometimes. Meanwhile, our lives are decided by some fucker who sits behind a desk their entire career putting imaginary numbers into boxes.\n\nThe week before Christmas was the killer. Thankfully, by that point, I had three other people with me, but the amount of work involved in a DC move is just vast. We were not allowed to shut down until 5 pm for critical systems, but ended up starting around 2 pm.  \nBy midnight, we had *most* of the racks disconnected and ready to be moved, and I was in bed by about 1 am. At 7 am the following morning, I rocked up, Panera in hand, to greet our movers. Those guys were *efficient*. Whilst we stripped the remaining racks, they got the first shipment off to our new DC five minutes down the road and, by lunch, all 20 were in their new home.  \nBy midnight, things were not looking good.\n\nI *could not* get the network up. It wasn't until the next morning that we realized a basic top-of-rack switch that was relatively new had just ... stopped forwarding traffic anywhere. We swapped it out, and we were back in business, but easily half a day behind. By 11 pm, we were zombies, so we shipped out and shipped back for 8 am the following day to continue the rebuild. For some reason, our Powerstore *would not* come back online. I spent about five hours (and several swaps of AirPods) on a call with an awesome Dell tech who helped get us back online. Sadly, because we'd just been consolidating all of our machines into vCenter, hosted from Powerstore, literally nothing was back online (because IT was on there too). We were now on Day 3 of the move, and I had confidently predicted that we'd have basic production back online by the end of Day 1, 2 at the latest. We started to bring things back online but, due to the network issues, followed by the PowerStore and the order that servers had been powered on stuff got ... weird.\n\nMultiple vCenters shit the bed differently, depending on, I guess, what had come online when. Some clusters were fine. Others needed to be rebuilt, others still needed hosts networking configurations to be reset. Super odd, but we ran down every issue and got almost everything online by Friday night. Note I said Almost.\n\nI was the only one to show up on Saturday, and I was the only one to show up on Sunday after posting in our Slack channel that things still weren't finished. I really didn't want anybody to have to work Christmas Eve, but they weren't making it easy. Thankfully by the end of the day Monday, enough was back online that we could tell everyone to go home for the holidays.\n\nThe few days off for Christmas let the burnout truly set in. I was dog tired from the last three months of 10+ hour days in a data center (thank god for noise-cancelling headphones, but it's still mild torture) and the move, the pressure of getting it right, and the pressure when things went wrong. When I went back in January, I pushed through the cleanup after the move, and was still primarily the one doing the cleaning, the tidying, the loose-end-tier-upper.\n\nAfter that I just sort of ... stopped.\n\nI still *worked,* obviously, but barely. Call it burnout, call it can't be fucked, call it whatever. By this point in my life, I've been doing this job for 20 years. \n\n20 years of every staff member is your customer, so you're going to eat shit if they tell you to. \n\n20 years of technically illiterate ELTs making technical decisions without consulting the technical people.\n\n20 years of being left in the dark on a project, then being blamed for not delivering quickly enough.\n\n20 years of being ignored and underfunded when things work, and berated and threatened when things that you said would break, break.\n\n20 years of record profits and marginal raises, and \"there's not enough in the budget for something that'll make your life better, but let's spaff 50k up the wall for a list of marketing contacts that'll get us one or two calls at best\".\n\n**Please, I encourage you to add your own! We all have them!**\n\n  \nAnyway, that brings us to this year. We had a significant leadership change at all levels and, in short order, my leadership tree was stripped away and a new CIO was installed.\n\nNow, at this point, I am a Director. My colleague, who *used* to work for me (the one I left Helpdesk with) was also now a Director, no longer reporting to me. There's a similarly convoluted story behind that but it's not mine to tell.\n\nThis poses new CIO with an organizational problem, but we decide to solve it for him. Both of us (directors) agreed that I'm good with the tech stuff and he's good with the people stuff. Let's split it that way, do what we're both best at, and deliver for this guy. That way we both get stuff we don't want off our plates and can focus on what we do want.\n\nI pitch the \"Let them cook\" plan, and CIO loves it. Says it solves his organizational problem, and opens up a sysadmin who literally built the place to go and finish making it solid.  \nI took the risk and told him straight that I had built the place up from almost nothing (and replaced whatever was there before), but that I had burned out, been diagnosed with depression, and was fighting out of it and just wanted to focus on what I knew I was good at doing.\n\nSix weeks or so later, they want to reduce my salary. On the face of it, you could say OK, sure, you're not a director anymore, you're an IC again, a cut makes sense. And I would agree with you, if it weren't for a few things ...\n\n\\- All the new hires at my (old) position came on at 30-50k more than I make, and they are being given considerable budget to hire competent, seasoned staff.  \n\\- There are comparable roles to what I'm essentially now doing online for what I'm making, if not more.  \n\\- I've already cleared a mountain of backlog and have four major projects (that he wanted) ready to go live  \n\\- This dude has not shut up about another sysadmin he used to work with.\n\nIt's the last part that sticks with me.\n\nThe money, I get. You're PE people from PE places, and numbers are all you see. You're like Neo in the fucking Matrix. Or maybe Cypher.\n\n\"I don't even *see* the people. All I see is 'Cost', 'Benefit', 'Opportunity' ...\"\n\nBut the reality is, he wants to deprive me of a job, of the means to put a roof over my head and food in my mouth, not because I'm bad at my job. Not because I've done anything wrong, but purely because he knows someone else.\n\nFuck that.\n\nI'm not even being dramatic. He brought up their name several times to the new head of HR, as well as my boss. He even had us all schedule a call together to chat and 'compare notes' so we could make everything exactly like his old company.  \nThey're great - fantastic person, probably going to be reading this and know exactly who I am. It actually made me and my boss feel pretty great because this person was \"one of us\". They shot straight, they saw the job for what it was, but they were still super psyched about technology and the opportunities we had to do cool shit with it. They were somebody who I honestly wish I had hired when I ran the place to be the new me. irony.\n\nThe interesting thing to come from the call was that a few things that CIO had beaten us over the head with because \"old company did it\" were either severe misunderstandings, or outright lies. We'd been led to believe that we were significantly behind the curve on several of our implementations and systems, when in fact we were level, or ahead, in most areas. The CIO's solution to these 'problems'? His pal could fix it. I'm sure they could, but so can I ... where it's needed. Like I said, we're ahead in a lot of places, and I fucking did that too.\n\n  \nSo here we are. 20 years in. I realized my dream of building up an IT department, and the dream, for all its many successes, which I must acknowledge, has turned into a nightmare. There is still so much in this tale that is ludicrous and excessive and I cannot tell, but what the experience of writing this has shown me is that this place is a toxic fucking mess and my psyche has been affected by the experience of it.\n\nI'm on Reddit at 1AM on a Saturday night writing this for what ... catharsis? Screaming into the void IS cathartic, and this is a digital version of that I suppose. Self-therapising? Coming to terms with *not* being wanted for no other reason than you're just not someone else. Finally realizing, as most of us do at some point, that no matter how hard and far we try to outrun it, our livelihoods are held in the hands of people who can't even be bothered to know who we are.\n\nThere's no 'realizing I gave way too much of myself for this job' because I've known that for far too long already.",

      "text": "I'm a RN of just over 10 years. She just took her boards earlier in the week and found out she passed today. She did 85 questions before it shut off. She had to take the new next gen questions.\n\nMost of our prep for the boards had begun towards the middle to the end of her last semester. I say \"our prep\" but let me clarify that she did 99% of the work and I mostly answered/clarified  questions if she was confused or stuck on any and of course, gave emotional support (lol). She did a lot of practice questions from start to finish of her program though which helped her tremendously.\n\nShe took it pretty quickly after graduating and it worked for her. We focused on ATI and Archer for practice questions and reviewed some of her weakpoints (Cardiac, Pharma and select all that apply).\n\nShe felt she had an even balance of mental health, mother/baby, med surg but says that if she had to guess then pharma and select all that apply probably showed the most for her. \n\nHer biggest problems that I could tell was not reading the question in it's entirety. She had some easy misses on her practice tests/exams that were largely due to her getting hasty and jumping the gun without fully reading the question.\n\nOne thing I forgot to also note is to not let the results from mock exams get you down. I'm not saying to ignore it but it's not the end of the world if you bomb one mock exam or two. She took one the day of the NCLEX (against my advice lol) and did *poorly* on it which really didn't help her mentality. She took a few leading up to the big day though and generally trended well and had the odd one or two bad ones out of the group. \n\nIf you have days where it feels like you're hitting a wall or you've had to re-read the damn question a dozen times and it still didn't make any sense then get up and go walk or do something else and return.\n\nTry to do questions on a daily basis if you can. We shot for 100-250~ or more usually. \n\nHope this helps/is appropriate to post here. Good luck. Ya'll can do this.",

      "title": "Physician Perspective - DPT Didn't Go Far Enough",
      "text": "Hi all, interested in your thoughts on this.\n\nFrom the outside looking in, it seems like the pre DPT program was either a tough Masters or a short doctorate. PT leadership then made a small extension to call it a doctoral program, but, in doing so increased student loans without any commensurate increase in privileges or scope of practice. From the physician perspective, it seems one could debate if it was a 'cart before the horse' attempt to facilitate lobbying for those vs arguing it's a better representation of the rigor of the program, similar to a JD. Other countries, however, continue to have safe, effective, and (by all appearances) equivalent care given by Bachelors or Masters trained PTs, while in the US PTs now have more student debt and criminally low reimbursement rates (in many cases).\n\nHave PTs ever discussed basically extending the DPT further while also keeping a Masters PT.  \n\\- MPT: prior program - 2 or 2.5 years to become a Physical Therapist  \n\\- DPT: a 4 year + 2 year post graduate training period with a deeper dive into physiology, pathophysiology, pharmacology, imaging, sports medicine and rehab medicine alongside clinical clerkships and post-graduate work analogous to physician residency, where afterward PTs would work in a role similar to a Sports Medicine Physician or Physiatrist depending on their clinical track, with more privileges (imaging, prescription, etc). More in keeping with what optometrists have done relative to ophthalmology (eye doctor vs eye surgeon; it would be PT MSK doctor vs MSK surgeon). With that, they would have a higher salary (eg +$150k).\n\nClearly as a physician one wouldn't think me to be arguing for non-physician scope expansion, but if I try to be objective from the outside looking in I thought of that approach and it made sense to me, so I was curious on PTs thoughts. As it stands it seems like the DPT approach neither improves upon prior PT outcomes (correct me if I'm wrong) nor has it supported scope expansion or better reimbursement.",

      "text": "Over 20 years of experience in Cybersecurity, backed up by several certifications (CISSP, CISM, CISA, CEH, OSCP, GCIH, GPEN, GCFA). I have been working as a SOC Analyst, SOC Lead, Penetration Tester and Red Teamer, Security Architect and GRC Lead in the past, and for the last 6 years as a CISO for two mid-size organizations. I am officially bored. I have come to the conclusion that I dont like the CISO role as much as I thought. I am looking back to my career and although I have been very successful so far in this field, I am not sure there is a role out of those mentioned above that would spark my interest again. I just know that I dont want to deal with organization bs anymore at the CISO/Director level. I got tired of convincing people on the importance of security. But I have bills to pay. A lot of them. So I need to keep going. I have thought of working for myself, maybe as a practitioner freelancer. SOC Analyst and Pentesting/Red Teaming is not what I would like to do. Besides, freelance salaries for those roles are not that great here in Europe where I am located and is hard to find projects as a freelancer in those domains. What would be your suggestion considering my experience and qualifications?\n\nUpdate 1: I am doing a couple of side gigs - Red Teaming is one of those.  \nUpdate 2: I understand some of you would dream to become a CISO. I was one of you. The salary, the reputation, the this and that. So you might see this as a first-world problem. I understand you. And you will understand me once you reach this level. The mix of burnout and boreout, oftentimes overlapping.  \nUpdate 3: Do people realize that CISOs in Europe get significantly less compared to CISOs in the US? Do you realize that I have three people under me who receive much more than I do because they are in the US and I am in the EU? And they deserve it, because they are awesome, smart and they have worked hard. So people who comment that I should retire, I have made a lot of money, I am arrogant and showing off, they have no idea what a CISO of an average company makes in Europe. Unless you work for one of the big names, like Nike, SAP, ASML, Novo Nordisk, Siemens etc, your salary will be very good, but no where near the 6-7 US figures to retire in your 50s. Full disclosure - I work as a CISO for a Belgian company and my annual salary is 120K. I go a bit above this by doing some freelancing side projects like Red Teaming, Executive advisory and teaching at a local university. ",

      "text": "I decided to become an actuary about three months ago. I’ve read plenty in the newbie thread(s), posts about others switching careers, resume posts, exam difficulty posts, what math you’re expected to perform, etc. While actually trying my hand at this career by beginning to study for exam P. Forgive me if this post favors others, but, I did want opinions to this particular post. \n\nSome people in the comments were saying they tried actuary science in school and switched to engineering and found it easier. Like wow!\n\nAnyways, while studying or seeing the posts here about the difficulties, I sometimes get discouraged. This post on twitter didn’t help, so i came to ask. \n\nDo you think this career is only for the gifted? If you are an actuary, do you feel like you’re gifted academically, particularly in math? Is studying enough? If I put in the 400+ hours that’s suggested for some exams, will I pass (eventually)? Do you think there’s a cap for certain individuals in this industry? I.e. if you aren’t/don’t feel “gifted” will you ever pass the more difficult exams? Or, if I put in enough hours will it click? Some people take exams 4+ times, so does that mean you keep trying until you pass? \n\nI just started typing, so you don’t have to answer all the questions. Just looking for opinions on this post!",

      "text": "So we have been open for about 3 years now. The first year our Good Friday was slow because we were still new and word hadn't gotten around. Last year on GF we did about $5000 in sales. This year we did nearly $7000 in sales. To put that in perspective, a really good Friday would be around $3500-$4000 in sales. \n\n  \nLast night our expo walked out middle of supper rush and just abandoned us. Needless to say by the time we were finally done everyone was exhausted, we were beat down and burned out. My boss said just do the -absolute- min we had to do to get out, as he didn't want to have to pay 1.5X pay just to do cleanup and dishes, and that he would come in early today and do them all. \n\nAfter working a 14 hour shift (Everyone else worked 6-8 hour shifts) I didn't say boo, I was completely and utterly exhausted as literally $5000 of that $7000 sales were fish and chips and I am on fryers. \n\n  \nSo today I woke up and was already tired and ready to be done but stuff had to be done, prepped, cleaned etc. for tonight so I was at work at 10:30 this morning. I was already pissed off at my boss for other BS stuff when he calls me at 11:00 wondering why I was at the restaurant already (I am kitchen manager and put in 2-3x as many hours as everyone else) and I told him I had a TON of stuff to get ready for tonight, etc. He tells me he needs to go to the bulk produce store to get a box of sweet potatoes and then he would be in to help with cleanup. AT THREE THIRTY HE WALKS IN AND ASKS WHY THE KITCHEN IS STILL A DISASTER!!!!!!!\n\n  \nOn top of that we had a PVC pipe break in the basement leading to a bunch of water pouring directly onto the hot water tank, shorting it out, so no hot water for the night...\n\n  \nI told my boss I am not working till Wednesday as I needed a few days off to rest after a brutal few weeks and I am VERY strongly looking in to a anonymous tip to the health inspector about the lack of hot water and putting out some resumes as, to be blunt, my boss cannot afford to pay me what I am worth.

      "text": "This is just a vent post cus idk what to do or feel at this point. I’ve been working at one of the last running Whiskey Creek steakhouses for the last three years. I am 21 years old and when I first started there where three other cooks all my age with one being the bosses son and kitchen manager. This year I am the last man standing and the only cook with any experience because the boss and his son and other cook left to start their own place. When the new management came in, she brought like 4 of her friends from her old restaurant to help. One of them was a kitchen manager. I was concerned because that was the position I wanted now that I was the only one with experience, so I talked to her about it and she told me that upper management was not allowing us to have a new kitchen manager now that the last one was gone because they don’t want any more the kitchen staff on salary, an that yes she had brought her in to be the kitchen manager but was not able to. \n\nAlarm bells ringing. How is a kitchen supposed to operate without a lead?! Well that’s what we have been doing for the last 6ish months and it’s been hell. Everyone needs my help or knowledge. I’m doing all the training, I have to cut my crew based on labor. consistency and quality are out the window, not to mention the kitchen schedule is always posted late and truck is ordered incorrectly leading to not enough inventory.\n\nNow let’s talk about wage like I said three years now and I just got my first raise with the management shift, and don’t get me wrong I will always be grateful for $18 an hour but when I have not broken 40 hours a week since I started working here it puts me on edge. And that is not an exaggeration. The amount of times I have been cut early because I am getting close to 40 hours is incalculable, it makes me feel like shit when I know the most I can ever make off a paycheck is 1100, and the fact that the servers can make that in two weeks (also not an exaggeration we are one of the busiest restaurants in our town they make bank).\n\nAll of the equipment is half broken it feels like, we haven filtered our fryers since I’ve been here because we don’t have a filter. we’ll boil out and scrub (which I do) weekly. \n\nIdk last night I didn’t start he smoker and wasted like 500 dollars worth of meat and no one was even upset with me. It sounds scuffed but I just want to take pride in my work.\n\nAlso it’s hot as dick, like over 100 air temp",

      "title": "I did it!",
      "text": "It's been a long road, but I wanted to share my victory:  \n  \n**I took my NCLEX yesterday and got an email from my state's department of nursing with my license number last night.** \n\n  \n**Background:** I'm in my late thirties, with no real\\* college education prior to 2020. I decided to go back to school after getting laid off during the pandemic, and after 2 semesters of classes, decided to go into nursing and started my prerequisites. I earned my AA and completed my last prerequisite in fall of 2022 and applied to \\~10 BSN programs across the country that same semester. I moved to a new state in late December 2022 and began classes in my BSN program 10 days later. \n\n\\*I did enroll in classes in 2004 and 2005, but neither attended nor withdrew, leaving me with a pretty messy transcript that did indeed come back to bite me in the ass later on. \n\n***Why so many schools in so many locations?*** \n\nBecause I could, mostly. Also because I attended community college in CA and got my AA for free, but I couldn't count on getting into an affordable BSN program in CA. I also couldn't afford to spin my wheels and wait around for a lottery or waitlist ADN program to become available. I was pretty broke, so most schools were willing to waive my application fees, so the cost of applying wasn't significant. \n\n**My advice:** Ask about application fee waivers. Consider moving out of state-- stepping outside your comfort zone builds character and develops empathy. If you're in CA, you'll have a lot more options elsewhere.\n\n***How did I pick the schools?***\n\nThis was a process. There are a lot of nursing schools in the US and I don't have any real allegiances to any particular area. I started by considering what kind of place I wanted to live in, because quality of life is important. My final \"must have\" list: population &gt;100k, within 2 hours of a reasonable airport, not Florida, reasonable-ish cost of living.\n\nBeyond that, after confirming accreditation, etc., I screened for which schools wanted the prereqs I'd already taken. Some schools wanted organic chemistry or calculus and I hadn't taken them and didn't want to. I simply eliminated schools that wanted those, because I wouldn't be eligible for them this application round anyway. Finally, I also screened schools for which ones offered a spring start. This eliminated roughly 60% of my options, which was kind of a surprise, but I didn't want to sit around for 8 months for a fall start. \n\n**My Advice:** Start a spreadsheet for your application process! Track application opening dates, due dates, fee deadlines, prerequisite information, whatever information is important to you. It is such a pain to find all of the pertinent information on multiple schools' websites, just go ahead and consolidate it in a spreadsheet with links to applications and whatnot. My spreadsheet saved my butt in keeping deliverables all straight!\n\n***My school experience:***\n\nMy BSN program was 5 semesters. It didn't need to be. It felt like a solid 17 credit hours could have been emails. The instructors were pretty universally lovely human beings and likely talented nurses, but that doesn't mean they were all effective instructors. I was a very active participant in class, engaging purposefully in lectures. I stopped taking notes after I realized I never looked at them. I swore up and down I was going to build good study habits... I didn't. \n\nDon't get me wrong. I didn't party. I completed homework religiously and turned it in on time and followed rubrics like the lifelines they were. I missed one single class (and I made the purposeful decision to skip it when I found out what the discussion for that day was going to be). That said, I didn't make school my life: I worked 20-35 hours/week as a nanny. I built a life in a new city. I hiked and biked and canoed a lot. I threw a lot of dinner parties. I drank a lot of cocktails and organized full moon hikes and meteor shower camping trips.   \n  \nI graduated with a cumulative GPA of 3.58, after having my grades from nearly 20 years earlier come back to haunt me. I still graduated cum laude, but I'm bummed that my poor decisions from BEFORE SOME OF MY CLASSMATES WERE BORN had an impact on my GPA.\n\n**My advice:** Don't let school consume you. Yes, go to class. Yes, do your homework. But please let the fact that you're in nursing school be the least interesting thing about you. Nursing is your career, not your life. Live. Make friends. See the world. If you're studying 10+ hours/week, I personally think you're doing something wrong. Finally, get to know your teachers. It goes a long way in building bridges and making it easy to ask for letters of recommendation for jobs or scholarships or whatever. \n\n***My clinical experience:***\n\nHonestly, it was a mixed bag. I spent some time at a SNF, on med/surg floor, in stepdown, in the ICU, and in the ED. I had a single day each in L&amp;D, peds, picu, and postpartum. The facilities were a mixed bag, but I felt really fortunate to spend some time at all 3 major hospitals in my area. What I thought I wanted wound up not being at all what I wanted to apply for, mostly for culture reasons. I realized I'd much rather work somewhere that was a good culture fit than get what I thought I wanted and wind up miserable.\n\n**My advice:** Keep an open mind. There's something to learn everywhere. Pay attention to the culture of different facilities and specialties. Don't be your own limiter. \n\n***Finances:*** \n\nI knew I'd be paying out-of-state (OOS) tuition for the first year. I confirmed it with the registrar prior to accepting my seat. I also made a checklist of what I needed to do to petition my residency status and become an in-state (IS) resident. I did all those things... and had my petition denied because of... unknown reasons. I fought tooth and nail, appealed and re-appealed, but did wind up paying OOS tuition for 3 of my 5 semesters. I was mad about it. I also fucked up and didn't know about all of the scholarship opportunities available to me those first 3 semesters, but had all of my tuition and books paid for by scholarships the remainder of the program. \n\nBeyond that, I burned through savings and worked. I fully acknowledge that I wasn't living super frugally (no roommates, for instance). I kept my two dogs. I traveled a tiny bit, mostly to see family. It's just money. \n\n**My advice:** Meet with a financial aid advisor immediately. I didn't and it cost me money. I didn't know I could appeal my financial aid designation. I didn't know about the school's universal scholarship application. I didn't know that they could have helped me finesse my residency petition. \n\n***NCLEX prep:***\n\nMy school mandated the use of KAPLAN as test prep. It was included in most of our lecture classes, utilizing some of the tests as assignments. We had a full-on prep course our final semester that was basically just \"do this test, remediate the questions, create a study plan to address your deficiencies\" every week. I didn't love KAPLAN. I didn't use it extensively, maybe doing another 300 questions post-graduation. Eventually, I just kinda felt like it was all blurring together and my practice scores were dropping and I was feeling dumber, so I abandoned KAPLAN entirely about 4 days before the test. I scheduled my NCLEX for as soon as my work schedule allowed, about 4 weeks post graduation. It completed at 85 questions and took me 56 minutes. \n\n I felt very unsure about how I was doing on the test, and panicked internally when it shut off. I didn't feel particularly confident-- there were drugs and procedures that I couldn't recall anything about. Yes, I got \"the good pop-up\" about 90 minutes later. My state emailed me my license info later that evening. \n\n**My advice:** Yes, learning about NCLEX-style questions helped. Yes, attending nursing school helped. That said, I think the thing that benefitted me most was being a voracious reader-- I read very quickly and have good comprehension, even at speed. I'm not convinced that KAPLAN was the magic bullet. I didn't spend money on any other study systems. I'm not big on youtube videos. I tried listening to some podcasts by some guy named Mark but couldn't get through them. Learning how to interpret NCLEX style questions is probably the most helpful thing... and I guess I used KAPLAN exclusively for that. \n\n***Job stuff***:\n\nAs mentioned above, I thought I knew where I wanted to work: which hospital, which units... and then clinicals really made me change my mind. I realized culture and work/life balance were more important to me than anything else, so I shifted gears. The hospital system I ultimately wanted to work for is notoriously difficult to get hired into, so when I found out about their nursing residency program, I decided that was my ticket in. They accept 8 BSN new grads annually, so I compiled their (extensive) application packet, completed a panel interview, and accepted their offer immediately. \n\nI had compiled a brief list of alternate possibilities, prioritizing commute distance (all were under 5 miles away) and good unit culture, but I didn't need to extend my application efforts.  \n  \n**My advice:** \n\nDon't get so wrapped up in what you think you want that you lose track of the reality of that unit. Don't sign an employment offer more than 6 months before you graduate. You're still learning. If hospitals are willing to hire that far ahead, what's wrong with them that they need to snipe all of the naive new grads? ",

      "text": "**Just want to get this off my chest and maybe ask for some advice…** \n\nMy first job was in Technical Support for a security company. But to be honest, it felt more like a helpdesk role since most of the cases weren’t really technical. The few that were technical were challenging and interesting—but they didn’t come around often. After exactly two years, I decided to apply elsewhere because I felt like I wasn’t growing anymore in that role. Thankfully, I landed a new job as a SOC Analyst.\n\nI spent another two years in that role, and I did learn a lot. But if I were to rate myself from 1 to 10, I’d say I’m around a 6.5—just okay. I wouldn’t call myself great, but I know I work hard and I work smart. Most of my tasks leaned more toward handling false positives than actual threat processing (a lot of whitelisting issues, if you know what I mean).\n\nAround 2023, I started job hunting again. I was searching for more growth and, to be honest, better pay. On top of that, I was also experiencing burnout, which made me decide to finally resign. After about two months of non-stop interviews—literally every single day—I finally got an offer. It genuinely felt like an answered prayer.\n\nI was hired as a Technical Examiner in DFIR at a well-known company in the IR space. This role really expanded my knowledge and made me realize just how vast the field of cybersecurity really is. I got to work with some of the best people in the industry and was exposed to different teams and service lines. I had no plans of leaving anytime soon.\n\nUnfortunately, due to internal company struggles, I was included in a sudden round of layoffs.\n\nNow here’s where I’m struggling—I’ve been finding it really hard to land a new job. My last salary had already reached six figures (PH based), and I’m honestly hesitant to settle for something significantly lower. But at the same time, I’m starting to doubt myself. My resume doesn’t seem to be getting the same traction it used to, and it's making me question whether this path is still meant for me. 😭\n\nHas anyone here gone through something similar? How did you deal with it? Is it worth holding out for a role that matches your previous level, or should I consider pivoting—even if it means starting a bit lower again? Also, do you have any recommendations for free reputable certifications or training resources that I could take? \n\nAny advice or insights would really mean a lot. 🙏\n",

He left and things weren't working. First month he was gone I resolved 3 major issues he was unable to. Simply by researching how to fix and combing thru all error logs. I had nothing to go off of as he never wrote any SOPs or documentation. Not even a sheet saying where the servers and vms were located. Essentially everything the company has regarding their current environment is what I have wrote or developed how to for. (SOPs n guidance).\n\nHow can I advocate for better compensation or title change now—not 6+ months from now? Any advice from others who’ve been the lone IT person or had their role suddenly expanded to such a large degree? \n\nAppreciate any guidance. Feel free to send a direct message as well if you have some tips you'd like to offer.",

      "text": "I've posted a play-by-play of my actuarial career in comments sporadically over the years and people seem to like it, so I thought I'd try it as a year-end post. My main motivations are to give the college kids a bit more insight into how the start of a career might look, and hopefully also resonate with some entry level analysts struggling with the learning curve. My comp isn't super typical compared to the surveys, but that's not really the point here. It's just been my experience as I've been very proactive about understanding what the next level requires and making sure I'm doing all the right things, with some bumps along the way.\n\nYOE -2 and -1: I failed my first two exams with 1s a month apart because I totally underestimated them. Then studied properly and passed P and FM six months apart which was enough to get an internship. I also helped start my school's actuarial science club as treasurer and then became president the next year, got an internship just the summer before my last semester graduating in December, passed a third exam in that last semester, and landed a job in health consulting through a club-company relationship starting Jan 2018. \n\nYOE 0 (2018): Was an analyst in consulting trying to find work and figuring out how to study. Tried to study in breaks during the day because work wasn't constant, but that wasn't consistent enough. Also felt like a failure at the work because the learning curve is tough (despite really doing fine), so I put studying on the backburner to get better at the job. No exams passed and accepted all the work I could just to end up pretty slow anyway. $70k total comp.\n\nYOE 1 (2019): My work quality got really good on my main projects and my managers were starting to talk about promotion, but I needed ASA and I was three exams away. Finally passed my first exam while working after an 18 month drought. I started paring my clients back from like ~12 to focusing on three bigger ones, and growing my roles for those clients. I didn't really feel ready for everything I was trusted with, so my anxiety made me try hard to keep up with what I felt my managers' expectations were. But again this stress was pretty self-inflicted. $86k total comp.\n\nYOE 2 (2020): Dialed back on work and delegated more to focus on exams (~3 analysts), prepared for promotion and trusted my managers trust in me. Shifted to studying in the mornings blocking my calendar from 7-9am to protect the time and be mentally fresh. Passed two exams. Doing this also helped me be more defined in a management role, and doing less work helped increased my quality further. My main boss at the time wanted to start using Power BI and I was the only analyst to embrace it with her while others refused to learn. $96k total comp.\n\nYOE 3 (2021): Took two attempts at FA and did a lot of waiting for those results and APC, so I just worked/billed instead of studying this year and got a 50% bonus. ASA and promotion at the end of the year (ASA late delayed my promotion by almost a year). Dropped down to just two clients and fully specialized in one area. Specializing earlier than many helped me have larger roles and advance a bit faster than many, too. Used Power BI to significantly improve/transform internal processes, which also helped grow responsibilities and overall understanding. $135k total comp, also got married.\n\nYOE 4 (2022): Worked less and delegated more again (~8 analysts) to focus on my FSA. Got my own office on the &gt;35th floor of my building on my birthday. Passed my first FSA exam in Nov after failing in May and understanding how I studied wrong. Always just trying to do more and more of my boss' job before passing them back work. Started being a little more client facing and I own a really cool/important/executive level quarterly Power BI deliverable to one of my clients. Newer bigger source of stress was my analysts not really stepping up/growing up with me, so I felt like I was having to extend a lot both down and up to get work done. $130k total comp.\n\nYOE 5 (2023): Passed my last two FSA exams on the first attempts. I became much more client-facing overnight and suddenly own more stuff. Power BI development and the way it enhances our actuarial work/storytelling has become a major part of my job internally and externally. My mentors are really helping connect me to specific opportunities to help prepare for the next promotion approximately with FSA. Working on my presentation skills and subject matter expertise. Still a little too far extended down/doing too much analyst work myself, while really wanting to do the higher level stuff. I also took a ton of PTO this year with like 4.5 weeks. $165k total comp.\n\nYOE 6 (2024): Spring was knocking out the FSA mods, owning the modeling on a really cool brand new insurance product, and taking 2 weeks of PTO for my 10 year (dating) anniversary with my wife. Got my FSA in the fall. Staffing continues to be a bit of a challenge in terms of educating my analysts enough to be independent, but doubling the size of my teams has helped my workload a lot by adding redundancy that isn't me. I decided to fill my regular study time with work again this year for a big bonus to build a custom house I designed myself in Excel. $235k total comp.\n\nYOE 7 (2025 expectations): I'm really aiming to pare back my workload to only accept higher level roles and apply for promotion in summer 2025. I may not quite be the required level of refined by summer, though. This next promotion is a pretty big one in terms of visibility and independence of doing client work and I respect the bar I need to clear despite gunning for it. Because a lot of comp is tied to bonus/promotion, I'm not sure what comp will be. I might successfully cut way back in wait for the right opportunities, or the opportunities might come sooner and I'll stay busy. I've also taken on a few internal non-billable roles that will help lubricate promotions by getting my name out there in a leadership context and giving helpful experience, but won't directly contribute. Outside of work, I'm making joining a rec league soccer team, golfing more, weekly gaming nights with the boiz, and running/lifting weights a bigger priority. I've protected the time to run and lift weights regularly, but this year I want to do more. Comp could be anywhere $210-$300k but I'd bet on ~$230k again.\n\nAlso some unorganized additions - I pretty consistently have ~1800 productive hours in me per year. While I was studying that split was 1400-1500 billing and 300-400 studying. The two years I didn't study (waiting for ASA and FSA) I billed ~1800. There is other non-billable time in there too that pushes my average workweek to ~45 hours, and while I work evenings and weekends when I have to, I'd say my overall WLB is still good because Ive been intentional about my annual workflow and personal time to ensure I get the fun and down time/PTO I want. I'm generally working 7.5 hours per day (really 7 excluding breaks) as a baseline which increases to 9s and 10s during busy seasons, evenings and weekends sporadically when I need to, and I log off early at like 1-3pm or take long breaks in the middle of the day when I know I can. By far the most important thing for me in this career has been time management (aside from all the help I've gotten from others).\n\nOur bonus formula is a bit of a pyramid scheme where even earlier on I get a piece of the work I manage. Since I manage a lot of people/work and got into good opportunities early, this drives an extra chunk of comp in addition to my own hours.\n\nAnyway, happy to go into more detail, answer questions, read about others' experiences, or chat about career progression in general!",

My point of this post is if you dont hold your delegates/ employers feet to the fire everyone gets burned, im not trying to turn this into a crusade but at this rate of decline everyone is going to be living in a room share or worse in the next 40 years. My point is that with inflation all the goal posts keep moving except salary doesn’t keep pace. one of the higher paid packages is 73.5/hour thats still about 30% less than what the same guy was paid in 1980, what happened? is there an over saturation of qualified people? thats not what im seeing if anything its the opposite. If you dont hold your delegates / owners feet to the fire everyone gets burned. Im old enough to remember the 90s and im concerned with the trajectory things are on. People know what im talking about but no one does anything, please dont accept another 40 year decline and dont think robots will do everything and we will just get paid to live by then - thats not how its going to shake out good luck out there\n~from some guy with decades in this field, a masters in two states and old enough to remember the 90s lol im qualified ",

      "text": "**Here's my job and interview experience in 2025. 14yoe.** To not bloat the main thread, some topics will be in comments below.\n\nI was working at a fintech company and they did huge layoffs after acquiring 2 companies, nearly every engineer from our division was cut. it frikin sucks but it is what it is.\n\n350 applications -&gt;  18 recruiter calls -&gt; 12 tech screens -&gt; 3 final rounds -&gt; 1 offer;\n\ni applied to practically every single front end position in existence.\n\nSankey diagram here [https://i.imgur.com/pwHagNt.png](https://i.imgur.com/pwHagNt.png)\n\nTime elapsed: 3 months.\n\nI landed an offer with Marvell Semiconductor as Staff UI Architect!\n\nThis position is unique- hybrid of Front End Engineering + UI/UX Design. I was tested on designing UI's for semiconductor (switches, data center etc) data visualization, as well as javascript fundamentals. I initially asked, wouldn't you want a graphic designer since bulk of the work is UI/UX design? but they said no, they could never understand the technicals of FE dev nor EE. they wanted someone who knew UI/UX design, FE, AND EE. So i was a unique fit for the role.\n\n**Stats:**\n\n\\-TC: Years 1-4: 248k -&gt; 276k -&gt; 303k -&gt; 330k (Includes estimate of guaranteed refreshers)\n\n\\-High level role with Data Center Network UI design + some front end dev\n\n\\-4 days a week, 30mi commute 10AM-2:30PM, avoids traffic, 45mins. On call for overseas folks 8-10PM. + Occasional travel overseas to india.\n\n\\-highly rated on glassdoor, low layoffs compared to peers\n\n\\-incredibly smart EE folks; I studied EE in college but pivoted to FE dev and now this is almost going back to my roots.\n\nInterview:\n\n\\-I didn't even expect a call back, the position seemed out of my league, but behold, i did. Told recruiter my background in FE dev, not a pro UIUX designer but i know the concepts and i work with them. Said he'll get back to me and the next week they want me for a GIGA HARDCORE FINAL ROUND with 6 directors/vps/staff engineers. \n\n6 1:1's PLUS a presentation to all 6.\n\nOh my god I’ve never got grilled on UX design this hard in my life. \n\nOne of the directors (PhD from MIT) asked me: Say aliens are invading earth. You need to design a control panel for a missile defense system that is user friendly to the operators. Button? Console; command line etc? What’s the design like, how about communication? How do u communicate to others, alarm system? Should there be a mute button? If the operator is in a hurry and needs split second decision how do u ensure the cleanest UI design? Security?\n\nAnother director (ex-AWS) asked: Say u have a data center with servers and switches that transmit data, but data can be failed / low quality / bad transmission, design a gui for this.\n\nVP asked me: Say there’s a bar graph. X axis is quality and Y is number of items. Title of graph is “amount of items of various qualities over the past 24 hours”. Now, we don’t like this presentation and instead want the X axis to be time. But we still want to show the data for quality/# , so we’re adding another data point. How do we display the graph now?\n\nStaff FE dev grilled me on js fundamentals such as closures and promises. I fumbled on a few questions but managed to get most, explaining thought process.\n\nCrazy interviews, hiring manager told me as a closing thought \"This position is challenging to fill\" and i had that thought RACING in my head 24/7. what could it mean? Did he like me and i'm a contender? Or did it mean \"this is a tough role to pass\"; i asked chatGPT and it said \"THIS IS A HUGE GREEN SIGNAL\" i was like lolwut really? ok then!\n\nWeek later recruiter emails me \"I wanted to connect with you regarding feedback and next steps\" im like NEXT STEPS?? GG? lets fkin goooooooooo. and boom offer.\n\nCraziest part is i couldn't prepare for these UI questions, came leftfield, i just winged it and somehow i had enough intuition to pass them. Recruiter told me many candidates were able to pass coding, but struggled/froze on the Design Mission Control System design question. I guess i have some semblance of talent in UI design?\n\nUpdate 12/18/25 - been 2 weeks, i've gotten the repo of the data center network ui prototype vibe coded by offshore folks and i've been tasked to improve it. So far it's all dev work.\n\n\\----\n\nSome FE coding questions I had this year:\n\n**Discord -** tech screen - failed\n\nCreate a UI for a formula parser that has fields a, b, c. You can type numbers in the field and the output of the fields would be those numbers, but you can also type letters in the fields and they would add up the numbers stored. For example in field A if you type 3 the output of field A is 3. \n\nThen if you type A in field B the output of B is 3. In field C if you type in AB you get 6 (3+3) the reqs were so ambiguous so it took me awhile to understand the problem. NO AI, write on own IDE with screenshare.\n\n**Crunchyroll** \\- tech screen - passed\n\nCreate a react app that renders a collection of anime titles and its image, from json data;\n\nfor(var i=0; i&lt;5; i++) setTimeOut console.log(i) \"trick\" question whats the output and why?\n\n**Crunchyroll -** final coding round - failed\n\nPolyfill the \"getElementsByClassName\" function. Aced system design though, the interviewer was impressed.\n\n**Walmart -** tech screen - ghosted\n\nWrite a \"deepclone\" function that copies an object with variable depth and contains anything, including other objects, arrays etc.\n\n**Oracle -** tech screen - failed (passed question but they chose another candidate with more backend exp)\n\nCreate a react app that displays a credit card, with buttons to switch which cc to view, cc data comes from json. Clicking on cc will replace the text with X's- X's correspond to how many words there are, so FIRST LASTNAME will be XXXX XXXX.\n\n**Anduril -** tech screen - failed \n\nYou know in your IDE the directory structure, with folders and files? Given a pic/mock of that, Build it.\n\n**Amazon -** https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1iudddy/rainforest_loop_experience_frontend_l5_12_yoe/\n\n\\---\n\nClosing thought: It's rough out there for Front End devs. There are fewer positions than before, but way more AI/ML positions. However, FE dev compensation is still competitive, u just needa know so much.\n\nI'm not incredibly smart or talented, most other engineers are more brilliant than I. The biggest source of my success is the resilience to failure. The amount of rejections and failures is so high  but every time, i write down what went wrong, study it, and gain knowledge, so over time every failure builds up to more and more knowledge.\n\n*^(Note: I didn't run any of this thru AI.)*",

      "text": "I've been working at my current company for about 5 years. At my previous job, I also worked as a sysadmin for around 4 years — a place where I learned everything I know today. When I got hired, I knew absolutely nothing, and my former boss handed me a brand-new laptop in its box and told me to install it and manually join it to the domain. It was a tough but incredibly rewarding time because I was the only sysadmin at a location with 70 employees.\n\nAt one point, the entire company's internet went down because my boss asked me to do cable management in the server room — I accidentally connected two ports from the same switch and created a network loop. There were also times when I had to install the BitLocker package on all company laptops (people weren’t installing the pushed package, so I had to remote in and install it myself).\n\nThe point is, I had full admin rights. I learned how to use Active Directory, Exchange Server, and laid the foundation for my knowledge in networking and server administration. It was a very stressful but beautiful period.\n\nI left that company because I needed a significant salary increase. When I joined my current company, I was shocked — all the control I was used to was gone. First of all, access to Active Directory was done through a custom tool developed by the company, and I only had access to options like changing names, email addresses, and resetting passwords. I no longer had access to Exchange Center, servers, networks — absolutely nothing.\n\nFour years have passed, and over time, the current company has cut our access to almost everything. All sysadmin-level permissions have been migrated to platforms under the idea of \"self-service.\" Any employee can now make their own changes related to their user account, mailbox, software, and so on.\n\nNow, most of what I do is laptop installations, replacing faulty peripherals, and solving minor issues because colleagues reach out to me on Teams. Over time, I’ve tried to take courses to develop myself in DevOps and Linux. But sometimes I sit and think about how, a few years ago, I was creating policies to optimize company processes, and now I’ve reached the point where I’m just replacing a broken mouse. It deeply saddens me and makes me feel like I’m losing all hope in my professional life.\n\nI want to change something, but I can't find the motivation or the path to take.",

It feels like what it actually is interpreted to be is, \"if answers might apply to other people in other industries, it's probably a Rule 3 violation.\"\n\nFor example: [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1icxkmr/is\\_being\\_the\\_wildcard\\_developer\\_a\\_good\\_or\\_bad/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1icxkmr/is_being_the_wildcard_developer_a_good_or_bad/) was deleted this way recently. It was one of the more interesting and applicable to SWE folks I've seen here but because it tangentially is relevant to other fields, it was deleted. Responses here absolutely benefit from the participation of experienced developers, as called out by the sidebar. \n\nWhat I'd like to see is a lessening of how broadly Rule3 is applied. I struggle to understand why the above was deleted but of the [top posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/top/?t=year) from the last year, so many of those are still present. Of the last year top 10:\n\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1g0m8mb/be\\_aware\\_of\\_the\\_upcoming\\_amazon\\_management/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1g0m8mb/be_aware_of_the_upcoming_amazon_management/) \\-- Amazon has many non-tech managers and this is far more than tech-specific\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1b89gqf/the\\_cto\\_of\\_my\\_company\\_challenged\\_all\\_engineering/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1b89gqf/the_cto_of_my_company_challenged_all_engineering/) \\-- this applies to all managers. As someone who was a different engineer type before being a dev, the same root problem applies to all managers - many managers exist who have NO idea what their team does and cannot do even the most basic of job tasks.\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1gz9ksj/my\\_senior\\_engineer\\_interview\\_experiences/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1gz9ksj/my_senior_engineer_interview_experiences/) \\-- this is just blatantly an interview question/experience Rule3 violation\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1gtoe56/after\\_5\\_years\\_of\\_working\\_in\\_tech\\_ive\\_surmised/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1gtoe56/after_5_years_of_working_in_tech_ive_surmised/) \\-- this is the case in most engineering disciplines\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1fic0db/amazon\\_moving\\_to\\_five\\_days\\_a\\_week\\_inoffice/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1fic0db/amazon_moving_to_five_days_a_week_inoffice/) \\-- this applies to all amazon employees. FAANG is also explicitly called out as a Rule3 violation\n* [https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1g6j7vi/overwhelmed\\_at\\_new\\_faang\\_job/](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExperiencedDevs/comments/1g6j7vi/overwhelmed_at_new_faang_job/) \\-- most of the comments/discussion apply to anyone joining a new job and overwhelmed. FAANG is also explicitly called out as a Rule3 violation\n\nSo of the top 10 posts in the last year, 6 of them seem to be Rule 3 violations as well (but not deleted). As someone who was a different engineer in my first career (though not a chemical engineer, as the sidebar lists), all those threads apply just as well to my prior engineering discipline. And by the definition of Rule3 seems they should have been deleted.\n\nThis is just an example of the inconsistency in how it's applied.\n\nAn additional and even more fundamental problem with how Rule 3 is applied is that the further you go in your career, the less specific to \"tech\" and the more intermingled tech/people/processes are for the types of questions/discussions you have. And these are the types of discussions which get deleted with some regularity here. The impact here is it feels like r/ExperiencedDevs is more like r/MidlevelDevs because essentially everything in the staff+ category and much of the senior+ category has a lot of overlap with other engineering disciplines and end up deleted.\n\nThe specific changes I want to see:\n\n1. lessen enforcement of Rule 3 when it's pretty clearly a discussion that is beneficial and related to SWEs. I would not be in favor of deleting any of the above, for example, even though I believe they are current Rule 3 violations. Because even though the advice is basically generic engineering advice, it's still beneficial for devs.\n2. Remove the \"general rule of thumb\" section from the sidebar.\n3. Clarify somewhere what this means: \"notably benefit from the participation of experienced developers\" because most of the Rule 3 violations I comment in seem to fully fit this. So either remove this text entirely or define more what this means.\n\n",

They book meetings, handle logistical issues, conduct initial interviews with new hires (nothing technical), and set our salaries. The managers I’ve had have never had a good idea of what I’m actually doing. They don’t know much about the product and have probably never looked at the code. In my experience, whenever they try to make decisions on their own, things tend to go awry.\n\nIs this common? I feel like it would be much better to actively encourage engineers within the teams to take on managerial roles while still doing some of the team’s actual work.

      "title": "Boss cut my salary by 50% after firm lost a client… should I quit or stick it out?",
      "text": "The law firm I work at recently lost a major client, and now my salary is being cut in half.\n\nI’m in my early 20s, and I’ve been working as a paralegal at a very small firm. Most of my work was focused on collections for one of our largest contracts, which brought in a significant amount of revenue for the firm. I have a bachelor’s degree, a paralegal certificate, and about 3 years of legal experience.\n\nI mainly work under one of the attorneys. He has been practicing for decades and basically lives at the office. His wife is also a partner, but she does a different type of law so I rarely interact with her.\n\nLast week, he told me about the client loss and said he would try to keep my salary where it was for the rest of the month. He also recommended I start looking for other jobs and offered to give me a good recommendation.\n\nBut yesterday he said he crunched the numbers and would need to cut me about 40%. When I asked about my health insurance, he realized he hadn’t factored it in, so the cut became over 50%. When I worked it out, the new pay was only a couple of dollars above minimum wage.\n\nI asked him to put this in writing, and he said he would after recalculating everything. For now, I’m working without knowing what my paycheck will actually be. I asked about payroll, since by the time he told me this I had already worked several hours, and he said he had tried to keep me at my current salary for the month. I guess that means he’s not retroactively reducing my pay.\n\nHe said we could try to find other work to supplement my hours, but that’s not stable. Knowing him, he would expect the same level of output even with my salary slashed.\n\nI told him I couldn’t cover my bills with that cut and that I needed to think it over. I mentioned I was considering leaving, and he told me he personally would never walk away from a job. He said employees should stick it out in the trenches together. I used some sick hours to take the rest of the day off to think, and when I explained the situation to my dad, he said that by cutting my “rations,” my boss had already taken me out of the fight.\n\nEveryone I’ve talked to thinks it’s unreasonable to expect me to stay after such a huge cut. I even asked my boss why not just lay me off, and he said he doesn’t like hurting people and that I’ve been the best employee he’s had in years. That part is true. When I started, I had to teach myself everything and fix existing issues on my own. But to me, it hurts more not being able to pay my bills.\n\nSo here’s my dilemma. Do I make today my last day and accept a confirmed temp position that pays more? Or do I try to stick it out until the end of the month for the sake of my resume and a potential recommendation letter I could use for law school?\n\nTLDR: Small law firm lost a client, boss is cutting my salary by more than 50% (to barely above minimum wage). I can’t pay my bills like this. He wants me to “stick it out,” but I have another job lined up that pays more. Should I leave now or stay until the end of the month for the sake of my resume and recommendation?\n\nEDIT: I am the ONLY employee at the firm. The temp job is a restaurant job. I have been applying to other jobs, but I have worked at this firm for under a year, and the previous job I worked at was under a year as well (I moved states). So future employers/recruiters look at all the short stints on my resume and question my potential loyalty to their firm.\n\n**UPDATE**\nI had my meeting with him today and told him it was going to be my last day. We left on good terms and he will still be writing me my letter of recommendation. Thank y’all so much for your thoughts and recommendations. It helped give me a backbone!",

      "title": "8+ years out of pharmacy school and this is my experience in the profession",
      "text": "Looking back, the things I wished I hadn’t done at the time were the biggest launching boards for success later. And I truly think the employment I had as a student and in the 3 years following have shaped me as a pharmacist for the better. I’ve talked about my pharmacy journey in every interview I’ve had and always get interested questions about it.\n\nI had a pretty atypical pharmacy school experience. I realized after P2 that I hated it. But I was in too deep. So I had to keep on with it.\n\nWhile in school, I worked. And I mean, WORKED. I held at least a full time job from P2 onwards. I took a semester off, returned part time. It was a mess. I held a job at the 3 letter devil and honestly didn’t hate retail, just corporate and figured I’d find an independent after graduation. Well, that’s hit a breaking point and I quit on the spot one day and never went back. \nLesson: NEVER big box retail\n\nI had a scholarship thru my church that required like 150 hrs of community service related to my major every year. So I decided to pick up some free interning hours at a unique program that catered to the medications of marginalized populations. I didn’t really care about it to be honest, but I ended up loving it. The person who ran it became a major mentor and source of encouragement for me.\nLesson: don’t count out different paths of employment\n\nAbout 2 months later I found another full time job as an intern at a smallish bed hospital, on the overnights as an intern. I loved the schedule, it was great for my often over stimulated brain. I took it bc it was good for my school schedule. I kept it bc it was good for my mental health. I continued working here until I graduated. I even had a rotation there and slept in the conference room between clocking out at 6 and starting rounds at 8. \nLesson: I dig the overnight shift\n\nDuring rotations…. Was a whirlwind. I had my IM rotation and cried in the corner of my preceptors office, thinking I was never gonna make it thru APPEs. I improved from a C- to an A- on that rotation thanks to a preceptor who was brutal but really wanted to teach. I had my independent community rotation, hated it. No thanks. Never again. Had an am care rotation and honestly loved it! Had my institution administration rotation: too many projects but a lot of them were cool, including one on using a neural network program to identify the likelihood of ade’s in a patient given their demographic factors. Had two specialty rotations that I didn’t really care for.\nLessons: Rounding was not for me so residency was a hard no, community all together was never gonna be where I wanted to be\n\nSo at this point, you’re thinking: I didn’t want residency, and I didn’t want community. WTH was I going to do? Buckle up, because I had 5 jobs in 4 years. I assure you, it’s not what’d you’d think from that statement\n\nYear 1: Overnight pharmacist at a 250 bed for profit hospital\nI reached out to EVERYONE for a job, any job. My IPPE preceptor was director at his hospital now and invited me to interview. It was an overnight inpatient position at a 250ish bed hospital. I was offered the job and took it. I was petrified. But I did well because I was never afraid of saying I didn’t know the answer. I got ONLY TWO WEEKS of training then was left on my own. My first night solo, I had a hunch a newborn was given the concentration of gent the day before and asked the doc to order a level. I was right, and then nearly panicked bc the neonatologist had so many questions. My director was awesome but my manager was TRASH. I left after a year.\nPay: $44.34/hr 😭\nLesson: I’m worth more, overnight was the right decision, management can make or break a job\n\nYear 2: overnight clinical pharmacist at a major 500 bed academic medical center\nI landed an overnight gig at a very busy AMC in my city and boy did I THRIVE. I expanded my practice by responding to codes and traumas, doing more pharmacy-based protocols and getting to have real input on how our department functioned and how it ran. Lots of management changes was the worst part. But then COVID hit and we got hit BADLY. \nPay: 62.92/hr\nLesson: I enjoy more clinical roles but still prefer the 7/7 overnight. I found my groove here.\n\nYear 2.5: added a second job like an idiot\nRemember that cool service internship I said I loved? The owner called me up and said she was expanding her service and would like to have me join her. I had stupid amounts of school loans and a new car. So I took it. It was a dream. I loved every second of it. Until the job started changing. I was never meant for paperwork or reports or long meetings. And because of our funding, that’s what a lot of the job turned into. I left after a year and parted on good terms. We both know that the job was no longer what was best for me. \nPay: 120k\nLesson: I’m not someone meant for a documentation-heavy job\n\nYear 3: continued full time AMC job and added an even better per diem\nI grabbed my dream PRN job at another AMC in my city and loved it. The most well-staffed, and highly clinical job I have ever had. No one ver leaves so a full time gig would have been a lonnng wait. \nPay: 65/hr, 68/hr\nLessons: I found my sweet spot of not working too much while also maximizing my income and experience while young\n\nYears 4-9(now): moved for love, sitting for my specialty boards\nI moved many states away because I met a man on vacation and moved on a whim. (We’re getting married this autumn.) \nThis move required me to move to a much smaller city and I got a clinical job at one of their best hospital. As one of three overnight pharmacists I handle the ED, ICUs and pediatrics. I completed 4 years here and passed the critical care board certification in 2024.\nPay: 180k salary\nLessons: the job you want IS out there\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to throw this out there as a note to the graduated class that even without a residency, your future can be whatever you want it to be. It just might take a different path. And that’s okay. My path gave me experiences and jobs that weren’t always steady, but I’m a great pharmacist for it. And most of all, I’m happy.",

Is it simply something like Kubernetes and containerization overall, common IaC tooling, Clouds, Ansible, logging i.e just basic DevOps stuff, but with deeper understanding? Is it something more specific or foundational like NALSD, DSA, OS? Or maybe it's just matching a job that looks for a person with a deep knowledge in one certain topic?\n\nPlease share your experience or observations!",

      "title": "My OT saved my life!",
      "text": "Not an OT, but I do have a OT for a dad and have lived with CP my entire life. About a month ago I started noticing that my legs were stiffer and it was harder to walk. With that came trouble getting in and out of the car, driving, getting on and off the toilet. I also had hand spasticity which I’ve never experienced in my life. I relied on my wheelchair A LOT, which was super concerning. So I get an OT referral (my OT has treated me before) and head in for my eval, my OT tells me that I need to call my doctor due to my sudden decline in mobility; and that I shouldn’t have waited to hear that from a professional. I ended up in the ER a few nights later and was put on an oral muscle relaxer and told I was just stressed from college. \n\nA few days later my baclofen pump is adjusted. Midway through that week I go in for OT, and ensure my OT knows what’s going on. My OT is very concerned that something isn’t right, but also trying not to raise my anxiety levels. Long story short: my OT was very correct! Towards the end of my session, I start feeling really really bad. My blood pressure was fine, but I felt like I was another planet. Food and water don’t help. My OT tells me to call my dad and have him take me to the ER (I drove myself to OT)\n\nAnyways I safely make it to the ER. They’re still not sure what’s up with my sudden decrease in mobility, but it turns out the oral muscle relaxer I was prescribed strongly interacts with baclofen, and we think the increased baclofen dose caused the two meds to interact. If my OT wouldn’t have been there to insist I go to the ER I probably would’ve just brushed it off as just feeling weird, and potentially gotten behind the wheel. \n\nLong story short: my baclofen interacted with a different muscle relaxer, and made me high AF in the middle of OT. My OT made me go to the ER instead of brushing it off and going on with my day. Y’all don’t get paid enough, thanks for saving my butt!! ",

      "title": "Biggest regret in life picking OT?",
      "text": "I’m almost a year into being an OT in california. I feel like I made the biggest mistake in life choosing this field. I don’t want any arguing in the comments because OTs are always invalidating other peoples feelings on here and become rude if anyone speaks up. I feel like the salary amount that is listed when you look up the profession is extremely inaccurate. Differs by region/state/city. And no one talks about how you can cap out in your salary within a year. There’s no room to grow. There’s just a ceiling. Never once when I was shadowing or when I was in school was, I told that transferring very heavy human beings was a part of this field. How are transfers truly an occupation? I ended up breaking both of my wrists in fieldwork 2 and took on more than I should have. CIs treat students like absolute shit and exploit them for free labor. CIs have no training, no one holding them accountable, no checking on students to seeing they are okay. All the fieldwork evals have to be shared with CIs so you cant be honest about how bad you are treated because you want to badly pass to finish the hell that is fieldwork. Also, I feel like the career is just a sham because what do we really do? Everything? How can that be. It’s made up. There’s no real guideline. No outline. No where to get advice. People just throw out the words “imposter syndrome” to feel better about it. We are not taught to treat patients in school and fieldwork is too much too fast. It’s not a real career in my opinion. There’s no one supervising supervisors for scheduling so veteran OTs try to pick the easier cases and you get all the MAX A patients or behavior patients. There are not a lot of opportunities and job posts and if they are, the hourly rate is insanely low. It’s actually embarrassing how low it is. A lot of companies give you no benefits at all. If they do give you benefits it’s something that is almost nothing. Almost all OTs work 2-3 jobs to make a decent salary to survive. You have to live at work basically for 8+ hours a day and then take home work because you don’t have any time. We have no time to write notes, evals, conference notes, progress notes, and reports. I had a coworker who almost git divorced because their partner couldn’t handle how unavailable she was. We get double and triple booked with patients and are being honestly abused with the amount of work that we have to do on a daily basis. It’s also very unethical because patients aren’t getting the best care. I hate this field. I wish I never did it. I don’t know how to get out of it. What other career options are there? I’ve been talking to several OT’s because I work at three companies right now and almost every single person says the same thing. I have never heard an OT say they enjoy their job or they’re satisfied with their pay. Or that they don’t have any injuries and had to go on disabilities. I feel like I’m living through a nightmare I can’t wake up from.",

      "text": "Been looking at the BLS data for construction jobs and it's interesting to see how the pay scales across different trades. Not sure what I was expecting, but I didn't have elevator installers/repairers at the top by that wide a margin.\n\nHere's what the latest data shows for median annual salaries for construction and extraction occupations (2024 data). Curious to see what everyone thinks of these ranges:\n\nElevator installers and repairers: $106,580 \n\nBoilermakers: $73,340 \n\nConstruction/building inspectors: $72,120 \n\nPlumbers, pipefitters, steamfitters: $62,970 \n\nElectricians: $62,350\n\nIronworkers: $61,940 \n\nSheet metal workers: $60,850 \n\nCarpenters: $59,310 \n\nDrywall installers, ceiling tile installers and tapers: $58,800 \n\nConstruction equipment operators: $58,320 \n\nMasonry workers: $56,600\n\nThe job growth projections are all over the place for the next 8 years. Electricians are looking at 11% growth and construction equipment operators at 4% (at or above average), while some trades like boilermakers are projected to decline by about 1%.\n\nThere seem to be tradeoffs with each. Elevator work pays almost double some other trades but requires working in confined spaces. Boilermaker pays well but jobs are declining. Building inspection requires years of experience first. \n\nThe bottom four on the list all cluster around $58k, with carpenters and masonry workers even showing slight declines in job opportunities.\n\nElectricians seem to offer a solid balance of good pay (\\~$60K) with strong job prospects (84,300 new jobs from 2023-33). Plumbing (26,300) and carpentry (also has a good number of openings (38,600) also project a high number of openings over that time. \n\nA big caveat to all of this is how are tariffs/recession/government policies going to impact the validity of these projections. Including data collection itself, apparently.\n\n\\*Edit: For reference, [this is where the data](https://www.nextinsurance.com/blog/highest-paying-construction-jobs/) is from.

      "text": "Hey everyone,\nI need some advice on a big career shift that just landed on me.\n\nI’ve been working at the same company for almost 20 years. Started here at 20, small town, small company, great culture. I’m a traditional data-warehousing person — SQL, ETL, Informatica, DataStage, ODI, PL/SQL, that whole world. My role is Senior Data Engineer, but I talk directly to the CIO because it’s that kind of company. They trust me, I know everyone, and the work-life balance has always been great (never more than 8 hours a day).\n\nRecently we acquired another company whose entire data stack is modern cloud: Snowflake, AWS, Git, CI/CD, onboarding systems to the cloud, etc.\n\nWhile I was having lunch, the CIO came to me and basically said:\n“You’re leading the new cloud data engineering area. Snowflake, AWS, CI/CD. We trust you. You’ll do great. Here’s a 100% salary increase.”\nNo negotiation. Just: This is yours now.\n\nHe promised the workload won’t be crazy — maybe a few 9–10 hour days in the first six months, then stable again. And he genuinely believes I’m the best person to take this forward.\n\nI’m excited but also aware that the tech jump is huge. I want to prepare properly, and the CIO can’t really help with technical questions right now because it’s all new to him too.\n\nMy plan so far:\n\nLearn Snowflake deeply (warehousing concepts + Snowflake specifics)\n\nThen study for AWS certifications — maybe Developer Associate or Solutions Architect Associate, so I have a structure to learn. Not necessarily do the certs.\n\nLearn modern practices: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, AWS CodePipeline, etc.)\n\n\nMy question:\n\nIs this the right approach?\nIf you were in my shoes, how would you prepare for leading a modern cloud data engineering function?\n\nAny advice from people who moved from traditional ETL into cloud data engineering would be appreciated.",

      "text": "After seeing the past year(s) of people struggling overall to get a job, and not seeing something like this in the subreddit already, I thought I'd make a dedicated post guiding someone through the process of what getting an entry level (EL) job might look like, having been through it recently. This is for anyone who doesn't have a job already in the field, so I'll try to cover all the bases (whether fresh out of college or a career changer). Feel free to skip to the sections you need to.\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Before we begin:\n\nAt first the career can look a little daunting, and there can seem like there's a lot to know. Thankfully for EL, there's a basic \"progression\" to follow. The first thing you'll want to do is consider: is this career for me? I have heard firsthand the accounts of people who don't realize how much dedication you need. Without beating around the bush, you will need to be studying consistently for the next 4-7 years, depending. You will be studying on weekends, breaks, etc. It's not overwhelming if you pace it right, but it is a commitment to be ready for. Look into what the exams cover and if those topics interest you, as if they don't, maybe reconsider. Also feel free to talk to people here to find out more about what \"a day in the life\" is like or more details on exam coverage. \n\nWith that out of the way:\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#I'm ready, but where do I even start?\n\nOne of the big pros of this career is your degree isn't as consequential as many others. Some are better than others (STEM &gt; non-STEM) but many times it's your experience and exam progression that will get you that first job. Speaking on that latter part, let's talk exams. Often called \"the great equalizer\" due to how it's always what people look at first, and how upping the amount will usually put you ahead of someone with fewer exams. There's no pre-reqs to taking these, all you have to do is sign up. The two you'll take first are called Exam P and FM (Probability and Financial Mathematics). P is like a middle of the road college stats course with 2x the content. FM is a freshman's course in the math behind finance (think annuities, bonds, etc.). If you're unsure where to start, I'd recommend FM as it's shorter and easier. If you want a guide to the exams, [here's one that people seemed to like] (https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1eqi22k/p_fm_an_indepth_guide/). Also talk with people on here about the career. You can gain some decent insight in the newbie thread just by reading what others ask. Trust me when I say the questions you're asking now have been asked at least 1000 times before, and will be asked 1000 times again.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#Okay, I've passed 1-2 exams. Now what?\n\n##For my college students/fresh grads:\n\nStart applying to internships before you even finish the first exam. Hiring season will start around late August to mid September. Be willing to move for a summer if needed, one internship will very much help you down the line. Overall focus on passing those exams, applying to internships, starting/being a part of the actuarial club, and making connections through career fairs, LinkedIn, etc. Don't be afraid to go to your colleges career center, they are there to help you. If you've passed 2 exams already, and still have more college to go, either focus on some projects for the resume, or take SRM if you've done an internship (I'll detail why SRM later).\n\n##For my career changers:\nIf you're in a math-adjacent/STEM oriented career, then you can focus just on networking in free time. You likely have done projects that can be talked about in an interview. If non-STEM, then start looking into projects you can do to beef up that resume. There's more to talk about on it in the resume section further down, but long story short find a dataset on tidytuesday you like, and do a passion project using some combo of Excel/VBA, SQL, R, and Python to analyze it. \n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#The Application Process\n\n##Step 0: Networking\n\nNetworking isn't always required but it can help a lot to know people, especially since they'll often be the ones to recommend you later on. No matter if you're a 10 year graduate or still in college, there's multiple ways you can network.\n\n* Career fairs/centers. These mainly are for college students, so if you're in college look into these heavily. Putting a face to the name makes all the difference in resume review. Career centers also likely have connections to multiple companies who specifically look at your college to hire from, so take advantage of it.\n* Coworkers/friends. You likely know someone who knows someone who's an actuary, or at least works closely with one. Schedule a meeting, add them on LinkedIn. As opposed to the above this is mainly for career changers since you might have a network already.\n* Lastly, the most important method of all in my opinion: Alumni. No matter the situation, this is a very easy way to network with those in the field, but also actually learn about the career and about the nuances of routes you might take later on. While at first you might think to message through LinkedIn, there's a much better way to do it that's free and way more likely to be seen by the person: emailing.\n\n###Cold Emails: a quick walkthrough\n1. Go to LinkedIn\n2. Search your school, and then click \"people\" at the top\n3. Go to \"All Filters\", then scroll down until you hit \"key words\".\n4. Type in \"actuarial\" (or actuary) under \"Title\"and then \"Show Results\"\n5. In a new tab, search [\"Actuarial Directory\"] (https://www.actuarialdirectory.org/) \n6. WITHOUT clicking on anyone's profile, search up people's LinkedIn info on the directory. You won't always get a hit, but when you do, an email will often be listed\n7. Draft them a cold email. Use [this guide] (https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/ouoir1/cold_emailing_what_not_to_do/#)\n8. Repeat as needed\n\n\n##Step 1: The Resume\n\nSo normally I would write out a bunch of details on this, [but I already did it here] (https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1nxjs4c/entry_level_resumes_an_indepth_guide/). So I'll briefly go over what to look for in a project if you're doing one. While having something closely related to insurance is great, a passion project can work just as well. As said above, head to tidytuesday, and find a dataset that makes you excited. Once you have it, use Excel/VBA or R to analyze it. Python and SQL are also good to tie in/swap out if need be, the most important one in there is Excel. No matter where you go, you WILL be using it. The more advanced the project the better, but within reason. You want to push yourself to learn new things, not get demotivated. These projects often get brought up in interviews, especially if you're just out of college, so be ready to talk about them.\n\n##Step 2: The Applications\n\nYou're on LinkedIn anyways, so make sure to be checking it regularly. Use advanced search (like putting quotes around things so you don't get random other results) and trim off what jobs you're not interested in (clicking the little \"x\" button). \n\nBut let's be honest. You most likely hate using that method. So do I, and many others. Thankfully, we have an alternative: company websites. Search \"list of insurance companies\" (wikipedia has a decent one) and just start checking their listings. This will broaden your range, give you better odds, and with repeated checks you'll be applying before the listing is even posted to job sites. I'd recommend making a spreadsheet with names of each company and then a hyperlink to each so you can check these quickly. (And for a good coding project, build a macro to open multiple links at once). Overall, it's a numbers game, and the more places you can apply to the better, so be willing to move and take most any actuarial job if needed. Any job &gt; no job.\n\n##Step 3: The Interviews\n\n1st things 1st: Use the STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Response) method. You'll want to take a few stories/projects you have and structure telling them in this way. Google common interview questions and know how to answer the top 30-50 using STAR. I found it best to have a document with bullet points for them so I had an idea of what I would say long before I went into the interview. Also make sure to do mock interviews with people, or even just talking to yourself in the mirror. Typing is far different than explaining it out loud. \n\nAlso make sure to do research on the company, and have specific, unique questions to ask at the end. Show them not just why you want to be an actuary, but why you want to work as an actuary for them. Mention what this role specifically has that others don't. And overall, remember that this is a two way conversation, be personable. A stone faced monotone conversation will put you both to sleep.\n\n##Step 4: The Misc.\n\nYou'll want to also make a spreadsheet for tracking where you've applied, and the details of that role (location, pay, application#, date applied, etc.). The details will pile up fast and multiple times I've lost track of how long it's been exactly.\n\nIn terms of the process, I've found within 1-2 weeks is usually when you'll hear back from places, a month tops. Once you're in the interview process, 2 weeks is the max length before assuming you won't hear back (a note: once you start interviewing, don't expect a rejection email. It's rare in my experience). I recommend making one your questions \"when can I expect to hear back by\" so you have a specific timeline of when to check in again\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n#FAQ\n\n* **How many applications should I expect to send out?** \n    \n     As many as it takes. I know people who sent out under 10, some over 200. The sooner you start, the more rejections before landing something (naturally).\n\n* **I keep getting interviews, but can't seem land a job. Why?**\n     \n     This most likely means there's a weakness in your interview process. Do more mock interviews, record them and watch it back. Think of where weaknesses are/were in previous interviews and how you can correct them. Are the answers to questions in STAR form/said well? Interviews are hard, and there's always room to improve. \n\n* **I've not gotten anything in a while, should I take another exam?**\n\n     Now here's where SRM comes in. SRM is one of the easiest exams, and I highly recommend taking it if you only have 2 on your resume, and are flexible with going to either the P&amp;C side or health/life/pensions side. For jobs in the latter pool, that 3rd exam will be a decent leg up above other candidates. If you end up in the former, SRM's content is basically all on MAS-I (the corresponding 3rd exam). So the time will not have been wasted. Overall, taking another exam is never a bad idea, just realize it'll be a decent cost to you time and money wise, especially once you hit 4+ (but ideally by the time you hit that point you'll be employed). [Here's a guide to SRM if you need one] (https://www.reddit.com/r/actuary/comments/1iq8iti/srm_an_indepth_guide/).\n\n* **Should I take an underwriting/data science job if I can't get an actuarial one?**\n\n     Yes, depending on how much you need/want to switch. Underwriting and data science are the closest you can get without being actuarial (though note there still is a gap). Keep in mind though these can be much more saturated. Also, if you do end up applying, don't include mention of exams or else you risk them thinking you're using them as a stepping stone job.\n\n* **How do I write a cover letter?**\n\n     You don't. From what I've heard, most places don't bother looking at them. Even if they have an option to put one, you're much better off using that time to send out more applications. Now, if there's a job you're extremely passionate about, then go for it, but I don't bother with most places unless they mandate it (and even then, there's hundreds of other places to apply). \n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\nAnd that should about do it. I hope this guide serves as some help for those just entering/looking at the career. If I missed anything, or something needs to be corrected, just let me know and I'll take a look. I'll also try to update this as time goes on and more FAQs/info needs to be added.",

What I cannot understand though is why some of the people in this industry treat parts guys so poorly. Just had a fella from a company I won't name come into my parts house (you've all been to one I just won't say which one I work for) and ask for a control board for an RTU unit. The parts list showed three different options for control boards (ignition, main UCB, and an optional bacnet board) that the unit has. I asked him which one it was and the guy flys off the handle and says \"You parts guys all have no idea what you're doing. Every parts house I go into is damned useless. I can get this shit on Amazon for cheaper anyway!\" Then he stormed out. Personally, I don't want his business anyway. He can stay out if that's how he treats everyone. \n\nI understand this is an isolated incident but the general attitude towards the parts guys in this industry just seems to be negative overall. We may represent the manufacturer that you have a problem with but you must understand that we can only do what we are allowed to do. We don't want to lose our jobs just like you don't.

      "title": "My experience in Mercer Retirement as an International Student",
      "text": "I was an international student. Graduated from college, passed an exam, and finished an internship. I had a couple of offers from different companies that offered me sponsorship for a work visa, but the only remote position was offered by Mercer Retirement. During this time, I was able to work because of my OPT and OPT STEM, which grants me a work permit for a total of three years after graduating. I had about two years and some change left when I started at Mercer. \n\nFrom what I researched, there were three possible times I could enter the work visa lottery before my OPT ended. Not sure on how true the odds are, but everyone seems to think there is a 1/3 chance of being selected in each drawing.\n\nThe first deadline was very close to my starting time, and I inquired about it with my supervisors. By the time HR responded, the deadline had passed. I continued my work as normal.\n\nAfter some time, I was assigned to a client for which I had to work with a lead who is also not from the US. She has been at Mercer for a long time, and everyone considered her a great person. We met over a video call. She asked me a lot of questions regarding my immigration process and asked me how I got hired since I am not in the US permanently. I told her that the company had promised to sponsor me, and she looked surprised. She told me that she was shocked because she had been trying to get her friends from her country hired at Mercer, but the company had told her repeatedly that they don't sponsor. I tried to change the subject after this because I didn't want her to feel bad or anything. \n\nA couple of days after, I received an unusual call from one of the higher-up managers telling me that someone had raised a complaint about the fact that Mercer was working on my sponsorship and that I should keep it on the low and not mention it to anybody. They confirmed to me that they were still going to work with HR about getting the process started. \n\nThe deadline time is approaching, and I reach back out about my sponsorship requirements, asking them if they need any extra information from me to get the process started. The same manager calls me and tells me that the company has updated their policy and that they do not sponsor anymore, but that that might change because of my situation. \n\nI felt betrayed and cheated. \n\nI worked overtime, prioritized work over study time, worked while sick, took work from other colleagues who were struggling with their workload, met all my billable hour goals while others did not. I had to deal with the lack of time management from different leads which led me to work unnecessary overtime. Every performance meeting I had went well, and all my goals were met every year. I did all of this intending to be exceptional and to demonstrate that it was worth taking a chance on me. But they just used me. Denied me appropriate study materials, gave me 1% raises when inflation was at least at 6-8%. Most importantly, they left me hanging. By promising to sponsor me and then going back on their commitment. I rejected other companies that promised to sponsor me, and I tried to reach back to them, but it was too late. Positions were already filled, and I only had one more chance at a lottery.  \n\nSeveral people started leaving the team in my last year. \n\nI started saving heavily from my already unfair salary to prepare for several months of unemployment after my last work permit expired. I even asked for some sort of severance bonus, but I got denied by everyone in management. When my work permit was close to expiring, they asked me several times to send them a letter stating that I was leaving the team voluntarily, and I refused. I had a meeting with an HR lead to complain about the situation and ask for help. She dismissed everything I told her and then proceeded to say, \"That is how life goes\". \n\nEvery time I raised a concern on the matter, it always needed to go up the corporate ladder.\n\nI understand that getting sponsored is not a guarantee since it is a lottery. But the fact that they did not even try to get the process started showed me everything I needed to know.  \n\nThe amount of stress and emotional damage this experience caused is something I do not wish upon anybody. \n\n\n\nI am posting this simply to share my experience and help anyone who may be in a similar situation or is an international student considering joining this company.

      "title": "What's your unpopular opinion about teaching? Things you think but can't exactly say in a staff meeting?",
      "text": "I'm unsure if my opinions are unpopular, but these are things I've encountered during my time working in schools.\n\n1) Getting a teaching job is actually pretty hard.  I think it's a competitive field.  Having a Masters degree increases your chances heavily instead of just having a BA+credenital especially when it comes to good districts.\n\n2) First year teachers struggle with classroom management because they're creating a lot of lesson plans / units / curriculum from scratch.  It's very hard not to have down time as a first year teacher and the down time is what makes kids behaviors go sideways.  You're also trying to figure out what lessons have a high buy and and what lessons just flop from the jump.  All the routine, discapline and structure in the world isn't going to mean anything if you can't keep those kids meaningfully busy everyday.\n\n3) Department chairs and veteran teachers typically have the easiest classes.  New teachers are typically stuck with the remedial freshman who are bouncing off the walls.  My department chair taught 12th grade honors classes.  She was always heavily praised for how great her classroom management was, but her kids were all very well behaved and self motivated / college bound.  I think she was kind of oblivious to what our new guy was going through with his inclusion classes.\n\n4) Subbing isn't a good way to get in the door.  I've met a lot of credentialed subs who were passed over for contracted positions.  I also think long term subbing is a scam with all the work of teaching with half of the pay.\n\n5) Cellphones fried attention spans, but I think the real reason why there's so much apathy in teenagers nowadays is because school doesn't equal money anymore.  A lot of their parents and older siblings have student loan debts and are working low paying jobs.  Naturally they look at that and look at school as being outdated.\n\n6) Chatgpt and AI are going to get stronger and stronger in the next few years.  Every person I've met who works in tech is heavily confident that AI is going to completely change how we use the internet here very soon.  Google is 100 percent all in, and telling juniors and seniors to not use it is like telling them to take a horse and buggy to school instead of a car.\n\nI think there should be classes on how to use and navigate AI.  I spent the summer messing around with chat GPT and it's insanity on what it's capable of doing.  It can do a week's worth of graduate level research in 5 seconds with pinpoint accuracy.\n\n7) Coteaching doesn't work well.  It's usually one person doing all the lesson planning, teaching and grading while the other person sort of just sits there and maybe circulates here and there.  Ironically my coteacher was the most apahetic student I've had: always came in tardy, scrolled on his phone and dipped out a few minutes early.  I don't remember him actually teaching anything.  I felt resentful that he was getting paid the same salary I was without...really doing anything?  The weirdest thing was: I was struggling so much with this inclusion class that I complained to the head of the SPED department on the coteacher saying he wasn't helping and would just scroll all period.  She said \"Sounds like you need to learn how to motivate him more.\"  WHY THE FUCK IS IT MY JOB TO MOTIVATE A SALARIED THIRTY YEAR OLD?\n\n8) Some teachers are control freaks to an unhealthy level.  I'm unsure if this field attracts that personality type of if they become that way over time from this job.  I period subbed for this lady's government class during my prep.  I had a brainfart moment and told the kids to answer questions 1-4 when in reality she wanted them to answer 1-5.  I didn't notice until the bell rang.  She absolutely blew up my email the next school day acting like I commited a felony.  A piece of me wanted to tell her off, but I like not being fired.\n\n9) Mentor teachers should be paid to take on a student teacher.  I also think they should be trained on how to support a student teacher.  The lady I was placed with refused to give up any control at all and it was almost impossible to do the things I had to do for the TPA.  Those 4 months were absolutely stressful.\n\n10) The kids make or break this job.  If you work with good kids you connect with, teaching can be hillarious, fun, rewarding and even easy at times.  One year the kids were a total breeze and I truly felt like I was stealing money from this district since my job was so easy.  If the kids are blatanly disrespectful, resentful and rude...it's going to really hurt your mental health.  I put on 40 lbs last year dealing with all the stress. I always get nervous the day before a new school year knowing my fate is decided by the attendance sheet.\n\n11) Schools varry a lot.  There's several high schools in my community and they all seem like they have different vibes / cultures.  People always tell me admin creates the culture, but idk if that's true.  It's definitely very weid how one HS can be an uplifting and fun place while the one a few miles away feels like a prision.\n\n12) Teachers always say how much they love collobrating with other teachers, but everytime I ever asked for something my emails were left on read. I always thought it would be cool to collaborate and do projects with different departments, but I could never get anything to happen.  I kinda just gave up and became an antisocial island even though during the interview process they told me they don't like antisoical islands and like collobrating.\n\n13) I worked at a school with a 5 minute passing period.  The behaviors there were total shit.  I worked at a school with a 9 minute passing period, and the kids and staff seemed a lot less aggetated.  \n\nWhat are some things you think / noticed?",

I’m on 5/2 5/3 schedule (5 days on 2 days off 5 days on 3 days off) I work in the North East out of a grocery dc. I’ve been at Walmart for 2 years now and I really like it. Being on a 5/2 5/3 schedule means I work less than other drivers \n\n(example 5/2 schedule I would work 2 days less a month than them but I have off 2 extra days which is really nice but I can’t extend a day a week which usually gives a bonus of at least 175 dollars in my area since I share 2 trucks with 2 other drivers.)\n\nSome of you may ask how slip seating is and I don’t have an issue with it. We keep the truck very clean and we use the microwaves, phone holders, etc that we all bought and have no issues. \n\nI want to say a couple things about this years pay. I had off for 6 weeks for my sons birth and was making 1000 less a pay check. (Walmart gives this time off as parental leave fully paid based on your average day pay ADP and my ADP was a lot less then.) The final thing I want to say is if I was on a 5/2 schedule I can expect realistically to make an extra $10,000 without extending.  That being said it all depends on the individual drivers work ethic. \n\nI really hope this may have helped someone googling out there.",

When I have cases like this, I’m so often on the fence whether to pursue tx with these kiddos, as they will often score average but the parents main complains are things like: child won’t stop hitting me, child has a meltdown when it’s time to leave the park, child has a meltdown when I won’t buy them candy from the store, child won’t stop climbing on furniture, child doesn’t like to take medicine when sick, etc… I have been told these complaints are occupation based, therefore in our wheelhouse. But at what point do you draw the line? I do often see progress with kids like this if parents are willing to carry over strategies. Then on the other end of the spectrum, I have many parents wanting me to fix their child’s behavior in their session, which is super frustrating. I don’t mind addressing behaviors if the child has delays/complex needs. But with kids that have no delays other than just being strong willed,  I feel like I’m just being a parenting coach rather than a therapist. I just feel like I’m letting parents down if I don’t pursue treatment with their child, can anyone relate? ",

By hygiene shortage, I mean the one that was created in the heart of Covid when hygienists finally started to speak up and demand a more equitable compensation structure, and then the dentists got mad along with the ADA, so they began to push stuff like this). Above, I emphasize a formal education with formal clinical training because an office setting is rarely designed for this.\nIn contrast, a school is absolutely set up and equipped to educate students.

Focused on grinding away and working on growing from feedback to make sure I'm ready the next time an opportunity arises.\n* Having feelings of guilt spending money on extra things in life whether it's an upgrade to a new TV, another lego set or traveling when I have the chance. I realize it's this underlying nature to keep saving and growing my net worth but having a hard time balancing that against living in the moment\n\n**General Background**\n\nI graduated from pharmacy school in 2021 from a MidWest school heavily centered around clinical practice and slowly began to realize that it was not where I wanted to take my career. I was able to get managed care and industry rotations throughout my fourth year which positioned me well for fellowship opportunities. I completed my fellowship in April 2023 and started my FTE right after at a different mid/large pharma company on the East Coast. I realize that I am in an extremely fortunate situation with my role, compensation, and the privilege that had allowed me to get to this point - this is not meant to be a brag but simply a rather transparent look into my financial journey as a PharmD.\n\n* I worked at a community and hospital pharmacy throughout pharmacy school for $17-21/hr over the years for about 16 hrs/week allowing me to pay for living expenses and fund things such as my Roth IRA during school. Living in a LCOL helped keep the financial burden down.\n* I graduated school during COVID with \\~$110k in debt with an avg interest rate of 5.4%. I benefited greatly from the interest rate pause over the past few years which helped my balance stay stable. I've slowly paid off the debt that sits at \\~$97k.\n* I lived at home during fellowship as it was virtual while making a salary of roughly $55k for two years where I prioritized investing as much of the money as possible and building up a small emergency fund.\n* My current role is a hybrid role with moderate travel (think 2 trips/month) based in a HCOL city on the East Coast for a large pharmaceutical company. I work approx 45-50 hours weekly but have a great QoL and good work-life balance.\n\n**Income &amp; Net Worth**\n\nI joined my current role in May 2023 with a $175k base salary, annual short term (20%) and long term incentive (15%). There was little room for negotiation and I did not press to hard considering my expectation post-fellowship was \\~155k. Three months into my role, I was given a $15k raise due to strong performance and then a 3.5% and 4.5% annual raise in 2024 and 2025.\n\nI currently make $204k base salary with annual short term(20%) and long term incentives(11%). The base salary to grow at about 2.5-3% annually with minimal change to the incentives unless I get a promotion. In 2024, I was offered a retention bonus of $32k if I stayed in this position for 1 additional year to ensure continuity on some of the longitudinal work I was leading. This was a one time thing and not something common but heavily contributed to my bonus payments.\n\n**In March 2025, I received a well above average short term incentive + retention bonus ($95k), long-term incentive (21.5k) and annual raise of 4.5% which are all part of my 2024 total comp package.**\n\nSince I started tracking my finances 3 years ago, **my net worth has increased by $337,000. It started with -$65.5k at graduation to +$271k at the time of this post.** The current market has helped push the growth significantly.\n\n**2025 Finances YTD(in depth Sankey to come at the end of the year)**\n\n|Gross Pay|$203,000|\n|:-|:-|\n|||\n|Taxes|$65,800|\n|Investments (401k + match, Roth, ESPP, HSA, Taxable)|$64,500|\n|Savings|$25,345|\n|Loans|$10,500|\n|**Expenses**||\n|Living Expenses(Rent, Utils, etc.)|$22,220|\n|Food + Drink|$4,650|\n|Car(Gas, Insurance, Maintenence)|$1,290|\n|Travel|$5,140|\n|Shopping(Household, Lego, Clothes, etc.)|$1,575|\n|Charity|$2,000|\n|Total Expenses|$36,855|\n\nEver since I graduated I have used an Excel spreadsheet to budget, track my expenses, and manage my money. I've found having to sit down and go through and manually type each expense has allowed me to be more intentional with my spending and has curbed impulse buying. In combination with my spreadsheet, I now use Rocket Money as a digital supplement to my manual tracking.\n\n**Living**\n\nI currently live in a 1b/1ba in a HCOL on the East Coast. Coming from the Midwest the prices are brutal but it's a nice place that is very close to my job, the airport, multiple large cities, and the train station so I don't mind the high cost. I've renewed my lease for an additional year and will reevaluate in Spring 2026.\n\n**I've definitely been eating out more this year than previously - both from a health and wallet perspective I am aiming to cut back eating out and cooking at home more. I lost my groove early in the year and really have fallen into some bad habits when it comes to food. I'm making it a priority to reel this in for 2H.**\n\n**Investments**\n\nI max out my 401k and HSA throughout the year via paycheck deductions. My company matches 9% on the 401k which is a blessing. I max out my Roth IRA every year on Jan 1st. Additionally, I contribute anywhere from 5-7% into my company ESPP at a 15% discount and invest an additional $320 weekly into a taxable brokerage.\n\nMy philosophy has been to aggressively invest as much as possible **but recently have taken a simpler approach to automating my taxable investments to VT**. The breakdown is \\~70% ETF, 20% in large tech stocks and 10% I actively trade to generate some income that gets autoinvested into VOO. In the past few months, **I've trimmed down individual positions in ASTS, IBM, WMT, HIMS, SOFI and UNH and invested those proceeds into VT.**\n\n**Savings**\n\nI'm trying to build up a larger emergency fund (\\~9-12 months) given the volatility in the pharma industry just in case I lose my job and am unemployed for an extended period. **I've reached about 12 months of an emergency fund. Since then, my savings go towards three buckets - engagement ring, wedding, and starter home. All of that money is in a HYSA with a rate of 4.35%.**\n\n**Student Loans**\n\nI've tried my hardest to delay paying these as much as possible given the 5.4% interest rate across them and the other financial priorities that I currently have. **My student loans are now down to \\~85k. I put $1k monthly and put a combined 10k towards them from my annual bonus. Using a loan amortization calculator and assuming interest accrues, I will likely be done paying these off in 5.5 years - some variability comes from when the interest rates start back up again**\n\n**Travel**\n\nI bucket a certain amount each month and whatever I don't use I roll over to the next month. At this age with traveling back home to see my parents, attending weddings, and trying to explore new cities, this is a high priority for me. **This year has already been incredibly travel heavy and I expect the second half of the year to be so even more. It's definitely more than I would like to spend but there's a ton of events both with family and friends that I need to attend.**\n\n**Bonus**\n\nEach year for my annual cash bonus, I put money aside to fund next year's Roth IRA, $5k for savings, $5k to my loan payment, $2k to the vacation fund, $2k for fun spending (laptop, legos, experiences) and the rest for gifts for my loved ones.\n\n**Net Worth Graph - $271k**\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nj3ov3oz2caf1.png?width=1138&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5b588058b98d7d3d1898dd23549ccdcfd39c5ff1\n\nIf you made it this far, props to you. Please let me know what other information I should include in these updates or what would be most valuable to the community as to what I should share.\n\nEDIT: Added in background info on income to help clear a few things up",

      "text": "I have been dispatching for over 3 years now and have always had it drilled into me that everything an officer requests must be on a recorded line and everything you do for them must be recorded. Even if it's just a simple status check and they are seriously standing right in front of you (yes annoying but it's what I've been taught). Well last night I witnessed one of our newer dispatchers take a call on their personal cell phone and ran someone through NCIC/CCIC for the person on the other end of the call. Well I mentioned it to the person that they can't be doing that and the response was \"well they did it to\" and pointed to the other dispatcher we were working with. I have never witnessed them doing this but responded with \"well they shouldn't be doing it either\". Well because of my training, my ethics, and literally what is in the training to get CBI clearance I did email my supervisor to let them know. I live by CYA and refuse to screw up my career for someone else. Before leaving I stopped and told both of them that I was very sorry but I did have to let our supervisor know of the incident. The person who did it just knodded but didn't say anything and the other person said \"well you said something so.\" In a very snarky and rude way and then I left. \n\nI know on my heart I did the right thing simply because this was a security breach and if they are willing to do this on a non recorded line how much are they willing to just run or how many times have they done this in the past and we have no way to verify if it was actually for an LEO or not. Now I'm starting my 10 days off and I have no clue what I'm going to be walking into when I come back. \n\nI know a lot of people believe in MYOB but I don't think that's the right thing in this situation. Would anyone else have done the same thing and said something? I guess I just want to know that I'm not the only one who would do this. I'm just very disappointed that two people who I truly enjoy working with a like as people who do this. \n\n***Edit***\nThank you to everyone who has commented. For the most part it seems that I'm not alone in knowing this is something. That needed to be reported. I truly appreciate all comments on this even if they don't align with what I did. After being able to spend some time thinking about this I definitely wouldn't have ignored it. Probably wouldn't have let them know that I reported it but the view point of how it may have appeared to them was not part of my thought process. I have goals of where I want this career path to take me and I feel as though they would have been derailed if I didn't say anything. I'm still disappointed that people that I trusted and worked with put me in this situation but I know that I have it in me to do the right thing. ",

      "text": "Granted, I got my OTA degree back in the middle ages (LOL I'm in my 34th year), and it was something that was heavily emphasized when I was in school. I'm noticing many of the newish grads seem to be missing this piece. I'm not talking about brand new grads; it's hard enough putting all the technical pieces into place once actually in the field, much less how to put yourself into the equation so I figure they need some time to figure it out. I mean folks who have been working for a few years and should be past most of that. \n\nCurrently I work with toddlers in a half day program; 1 1/2 - 3 yrs old. While I don't get on the floor as much as I used to with them (my knees say no!), I'm active in, and acknowledge everything they do. Get onto a piece of equipment they've been afraid of - Whoa! You did it! Upset and crying - Are you sad? or You seem frustrated, let's try it this way. Putting coins into a slot - Hey, can I have a turn? You DON'T want to put doins in a slot? - Ok, let's clean them up and we'll do something else (cleaning up means putting the coins into the slot so we can put that activity away LOL). I whoop, I laugh, I sigh, I get exasperated and demonstrate it physically as well as vocally.  \n\nAnd I'm noticing most of my coworkers are really removed from their therapy sessions. They do to, not with. There's very little give and take, or even acknowledgement. If a kid is upset and crying, I often hear them say \"You're ok,\" which in my head is SO dismissive. If a kid has a lot of ya-yas to get out, instead of going with the kid's need, it's \"no, we're sitting in the chair right now.\" \n\nThis really hit home for me yesterday. One of my patients, a non-verbal, autistic toddler, has a hard time with transitions. To \"school\", to leaving the classroom, to leaving mom, to go to get his diaper changed, etc, etc and each transition is accompanied by a meltdown. For the past 2 months my main priority is just getting on his level and connecting with him. When I went to pick him up from his mom this time, he saw me, walked right to me and grabbed my hand. His mom was astounded. And I was thrilled - now that we've established that level of trust, I can start gently guiding him to things that challenge him. To me, having that connection is just as important a piece of therapy as fine and gross motor skills. \n\nBut it often seems like I'm the only one who feels that way. Has the OT curriculum changed that much? ",

      "title": "How I've Changed as a CI",
      "text": "8th year OT here. Current school-based OT but also have a background in psych. Like many other OTs, I've had issues with declining quality in FW2 students which has caused a lot of stress &amp; time as a CI. Main issues are professionalism, very poor communication skills (with me, with the students, w/ staff), and limited clinical reasoning skills. I've made serious changes in my approach (using the following tips for my last 2 students; I've had 6 total) and seen a positive change. I wanted to share this with others.\n\nFeel free to share any strategies you've implemented as a CI that seems to have made a positive impact on the trajectory of the student's FW experience.\n\n**BEFORE THEY BEGIN FIELDWORK:**\n\n* Provide a pre-fieldwork form for the student to fill out. I use google forms. It's brief. I ask what their background is with working with kids, what they are most nervous about, what they hope to learn about, and what their 3 best qualities are\n* Have a zoom or phone call prior to them coming (and after they fill out the form), to connect and get to know them. I obviously go over any questions they might have, but also ask about their personal interests, etc. Be warm. Students have told me this helps ease anxiety.\n* Follow up with a document of professional expectations and site expectations. **Don't assume anything is common sense**.\n   * I include hours, that they should expect to do some work outside of fieldwork hours, phone/technology use (only should be used during the 30 minute lunch), dress code, etc.\n   * This has SIGNIFCANTLY helped me reduce the amount of issues I've had with professionalism (soooo many students wearing inappropriate clothing or always on phone). When it outlined for them, it's something you can reference back to. Teaching professionlism during FW is seriously taking time from teaching clinical skills, so if you can avoid it by setting the expectations up front, it will help you and the student in the longrun\n   * I also include that if they have more than 2 absences, they may have to make it up after the 12 weeks if they aren't showing entry level skills to pass the final. This is my own rule.\n\n**DURING FIELDWORK:**\n\n* For every week for at least the first 6 weeks, require the student to fill out a reflection form. I use google forms. I include questions like \"what did you most enjoy, what is one thing that was difficult for you, how did you feel about XXX meeting, what traits do you think are important for an OT to have when presenting in meetings, what do you need more support in, etc\". I provide a lot of face-to-face check-ins and meetings, but I find so many students don't open up, and I get more info with these forms\n* Give them tests. I created a 10 question quiz for each school-based evaluation tool (ie- Beery, SPM-2, SP-2, DVTP, TVPS, THS, SFA)  to make sure they were actually looking through the manual and understanding scoring, basal/ceilings, etc. It is an open book test (again I use google forms) so it's nothing that they can't find in the manual, but requires them to actually do it. I probably had them do 2 a week until they got through them all\n   * If you work in a different setting with less evaluations, you could make quizzes for other things that are more relevant. For example, if you work inpatient neuro unit, you could make a quiz on working with TBI patients, working with SCI patients, etc.\n   * If you work inpatient mental health, you could make quizzes on scenarios of how to redirect certain things that might happen in group (what to do if a patient starts screaming profanities, if a patient starts engaging in self-harm, in 2 patients start to get in a heated argument, etc).\n* Give them projects and have them present it. I assign 2 projects.\n   * The first one is just any evidence-based article that has to do with the school system, and what OTs could take from it. They present it virtually to all OTs in the district\n   * The second is a case study- they pick a student (usually after about week 8) and tie with any FOR, and how we can use the FOR to support the student. They present it to the school team, in person.\n   * The FW student has past projects from previous students to reference\n* If you have ANY concerns, address it immediately. Don't let it build up. When you confront the student about it, frame it like you want to find a solution together.\n* If applicable, teach them your organizational strategy from week 1. I give my student a weekly planner (same as mine) and show them how I organize my workload for the week. I have them pencil in our therapy sessions and tell them when we will be taking a student to test, have an IEP meeting, etc. When they are actively engaged in the scheduling, even if it is just writing down what you are telling them, they feel more prepared.\n* If there' any downtime, always have something for them to be doing. For example, my student is in her last 2 weeks and we are at a lull for evaluations, so there is some downtime when I am at duties. I'm having her participate in webinars on [occupationaltherapy.com](http://occupationaltherapy.com) on trauma informed approach, or she's reading my copy of \"no drama discipline\" to grow her behavior management skills.\n\nAll of these strategies took a lot of time in the beginning (such as creating all of the quizzes), but now that I have them, it's actually saving me time. The student is taking more accountability for their own learning. I find that they all enjoy the structure and leave the fieldwork feeling like they learned a tremendous amount. I've felt very confident in their entry level skills for school-based OT, but also feel like I've given them a good foundation of how to enter the working world. ",

      "text": "TLDR: Took a shit retail job that I hated fresh out of school, coming up on 1 year at the same job, managed to make a pivot into a middle office middle market CB role. \n\nI posted roughly 9 months ago about hating a job I landed straight out of college in retail banking. I was being offered an FP&amp;A role a few months in and was seriously considering it, especially after a lot of people here said to take it. Things ended up not working out and I had to stay in my miserable, mentally draining, low fulfillment retail banking job that I loathed. \n\nI only took this job because after hundreds of applications and several months I couldn't land any other job. I definitely had too high of expectations fresh out of school, especially in this market. I'm very grateful for the job as a lot of my classmates are still unemployed. But nevertheless I was unhappy at my job and needed to get out. One of the first things I told my manager was that I hated the job but that I would do it and do it well if it meant I could move to another LOB within the bank.\n\nI immediately started networking within the bank, calling, emailing, going to corporate events etc... there were a lot of people who told me retail banking was a dead end and it would NOT help me land a job in any \"real\" finance role. However, I was constantly talking to people in private banking, IB, commercial banking, WM, etc... I took courses in commercial credit offered by the bank, signed up for seminars, anything that would help improve my brand. Asked to be connected with anyone else that might be of help after each interaction. Followed up after a few weeks and kept in touch with people that were in roles I was interested in. \n\nFast-forward to today, I networked my way into a middle market, middle office role at the same bank. I start next month, will recieve a 50% base salary increase, a hybrid schedule, and a clear path to a FO role.\n\nNo it's not IB, PE or VC, no I'm not making 500k in total comp, but hopefully this is a glimmer of hope to any recent or soon to be grad that feels stuck in a job they dislike, can't find a job, or feeling discouraged in this job market. It does get better, if you're willing to stick it out and put in the work.",

My application included 2 essays, the ATDH, an interview, 2 years of prerequisites, etc. Basically it was the hardest thing I’ve ever done, I’m not a naturally good student or a genius I have to work very hard in school to do well so the fact that I got into this program with a 20% acceptance rate on the first try is so mind boggling to me and I’m so proud of myself it doesn’t even feel real. I guess I just wanted to share that because whew that was so much stress. I’m really excited to start the program this summer and if anyone has any advice for me I’d love to hear it!! :) I know it’s going to be a million times harder than the application process but I’m ready, the only thing that makes me nervous is that you can’t get below a C on any assignments in order to stay in the program and if that includes tests then I’m screwed because I’m a terrible tester. Anyway sorry for rambling overall I’m just really happy and nervous.",

Wondered when this day would come.\n\nLeaving the grocery store and some guy is ODing on the goddam sidewalk - well actually half way in the bushes. I see someone doing really shitty compressions and overhear he’s had four doses of narcan!? Bystander on phone with 911. Dude looked dead. Friends saying “he’s gone”. \n\nNot so fast. We pull him out of the bush and onto the sidewalk. I tapped friend doing the shitty compressions out and started at it. His friend said he felt a pulse. I felt nothing so kept going. I’ve been in the NICU for a while and forgot how hard an adult chest is! Like holy sh*t. Didn’t help that I literally just came from the gym and my arms were shakey AF. Dude, got another dose of narcan and homey came back. \n\nMan, that sucked. His girlfriend’s big sad blue eyes are burned into my mind. She looked so scared and heartbroken. She seemed so young:( \n\nStanding there, watching the dude’s buddies getting him in chair and dumping water on his head making him mad (kinda comedic). I hear the one bystander ask the other “have you seen anything like this before”. “No”, she says. They’re both visibly shaken and, I’ll admit, so was I. It’s a whole different ballgame when you’re out in the wild and you have nobody else there who knows the things too. \n\nCop shows up and is talking to the bystanders, assessing the situation. I straight dip out. Like Irish Goodbyed it. It was like my RT mode activated. I did the things and like a phantom, straight ghosted the situation. \n\nHere’s the hindsight: He prob OD’d on fent. I didn’t ask. Just assumed. And now I’m asking myself did I put myself in danger? What if I inadvertently got it in my system. Like what are you supposed to do?! He looked dead when I got there. Like blue/purple and empty eyes, mouth agape. I have no idea how long he had been like that. \n\nUgh, I hope I never have to do that again. It’s just so frickin sad.\n\nWould love to hear your CPR in the wild stories too. ",

      "text": "To my fellow snot suckers, neb jockeys, and aggressive weaners:\n\nTo my great surprised, yesterday I received a notification inviting me to join the mod team here. I've been an active member here for several years, so it's wonderful to join the mod team.\n\nA little about me: I've been an RT for 10 years (plus 1 where I worked as a student); I got my bachelor's right out of college, did nothing with that for several years, and then stumbled into RT in my late 20s. I've been a traveler for 4 years, and I've worked in 6 different states (7 if you count my 3 weeks in Texas during COVID). I obtained my ACCS in 2019, and earned a master's in respiratory care in 2023. While there are certainly aspects I don't like I'm a huge RT cheerleader and have taught RT students, RN students, med students, pharm students, medical residents, and given in-services to PT, OT, and SLP.\n\nIn 2020 I started PA school, with the hope that I could work pulm/critical care. Albuterol for CHF? Not on my watch! Sadly, PA school was like nothing I'd ever experienced before (or since) and I failed out 80% through didactic. Shortly thereafter, I was invited to help moderate r/prephysicianassistant, where I still help advise how to get into PA school. \n\nI mention that only to say that I'm not some basement dweller out for power like cliché Reddit mods. I'm one of you, and I want everyone to have a good time here, exchange information, and collaborate. While I haven't discussed this with the mod team, my hopes for this sub are: \n\n1) A wiki-style information page covering frequently asked questions (like how to pass the TMC/CSE/whatever the future exam is called). Along with that, posts that ask questions that can be found in the wiki would be directed to the wiki and deleted. \n\n2) Similarly, I want better visibility of the thread with pay info. Posts that ask about pay would be directed to the thread and deleted. \n\n3) The automod. There have been attempts to have the automod do some work. That's fine, but that hasn't always gone well. Posts/comments with any sort of curse word were summarily deleted, and right now any comment deemed a run-on sentence gets flagged and held. \n\n4) In general, I view my role as a moderator as just that, a *moderator*. I wish to moderate content. I'm a referee, deciding if someone is being too rude, or if a patient question crosses the line. That also means I want your input. Is there something you want to see in this sub? Is there something that isn't working? Then I want to hear from you. \n\nKeep in mind that none of my proposed changes are happening any time soon. Between work and life, writing/editing a wiki for this sub can take some time, plus I want feedback from the rest of the mod team. I only want to introduce myself and share with you my hopes for this sub. \n\nThanks! ",

      "title": "Where are we going with Respiratory?",
      "text": "I believe a major issue facing the respiratory therapy field today is a lack of direction from our leadership. Ten years ago, we had the AARC’s 2015 and Beyond goals, which laid out clear guidelines for advancing the profession. These goals included:\n\n-Establishing advanced credentials, such as the RRT as the standard and promoting the ACCS specialization.\n\n-Recommending the bachelor’s degree as the entry-level standard for new therapists.\n\n-Developing and implementing the Advanced Practice Respiratory Therapist (APRT) role.\n\n-Positioning RTs as clinical leaders rather than task-based staff.\n\nNow, a decade later, few of these goals have been realized. The APRT program is struggling to gain traction and remains stuck in political and institutional gridlock. The push for a BS degree as the entry-level standard has largely been abandoned. Advanced credentials like ACCS have not become widespread or incentivized.\n\nWe are experiencing a crisis of leadership and vision in our professional organizations. This is not a “future” problem — it is a current emergency. Any roadmap for the profession must begin by addressing our most urgent and immediate need: stabilizing the RT workforce and improving recruitment and retention.\n\nWe currently face several critical challenges:\n\n-Severe staffing shortages across hospitals and long-term care facilities. Many RTs are leaving for nursing, travel positions, or leaving healthcare entirely.\n\n-High burnout, increased turnover, and early career exits.\n\n-RT education programs are struggling to recruit students, and enrollment is declining.\n\n-Wage stagnation continues, despite increasing workloads.\n\n-RTs are being asked to do more with fewer resources, which puts patient safety at risk.\n\nTo begin addressing these issues, the top priority must be workforce stabilization. We need to focus on attracting and retaining new RTs while keeping experienced therapists in the field.\n\nIn the short term, we may need to accept that a step backward is necessary before we can move forward. Hospitals with unrealistic floor workloads may need to shift some routine tasks, such as MDIs or simple nebulizers, to nursing staff. RTs should be concentrated in areas where they provide the most clinical value, such as the ICU, ER, step-down units, tracheostomy care, chest physiotherapy, and airway management.\n\nSmaller community hospitals may face the greatest difficulty. Some may attempt to cut or eliminate RT staffing altogether, especially if they are financially strained. That would be a dangerous move, but unfortunately, it could become more common. In many of these facilities, RTs may soon be seen as a luxury rather than a necessity.\n\nWe may need to reach the bottom before the profession can rebuild. This crisis cannot be fixed overnight. However, once we stabilize the system, we can begin to rebuild the pipeline, refocus RT roles, and grow again — strategically and sustainably.\n\nLooking forward, we should consider shifting our clinical focus more permanently to areas of high value, such as ICU care, step-down management, airways, tracheostomies, and complex therapies. We may no longer have the staffing numbers to support traditional floor therapy workloads, and even travel RTs may not be able to close the gap in the future.\n\nRegarding the APRT, I may be in the minority, but I believe it is a flawed concept — not because of the role itself, but because of how it was executed. We are creating supply before there is demand. Hospitals are not asking for APRTs. Graduates are being produced with no clear hiring path and no established reimbursement structure.\n\nUntil we address the staffing crisis, pay disparities, and the profession’s visibility, the APRT feels like a misplaced effort. As it stands, we are attempting to build a second story on a house with a crumbling foundation. The average RT does not want or need a new degree right now. They want fair pay, better working conditions, and respect — and they need it now, not five years from now.\n\nA more realistic path forward could be:\n\n-Develop clinical ladders within the existing RRT framework.\n\n-Expand protocol-driven care in the ICU and step-down environments.\n\n-Prioritize compensation, retention, and recognition for bedside RTs.\n\t\n-Invest in leadership, education, and research pathways that already exist and can be expanded.\n\nMost importantly, we should explore RT-to-PA and RT-to-perfusion bridge programs. These pathways could offer more promising career advancement opportunities. RTs already have direct patient care experience and a strong foundation in cardiopulmonary physiology. Creating structured bridges to PA and perfusion programs could attract more students to RT programs and give current RTs realistic upward mobility.\n\nThere is no question that we are facing a crisis. The profession lacks leadership, direction, and a unified voice. Without decisive action, the situation will continue to deteriorate. But with honest assessment, strategic thinking, and collaboration, we can stabilize the workforce and build a more sustainable future — one that works for both patients and respiratory therapists alike.\n",

      "text": "I’ve walked a really odd path in this trade. I started out in commercial at an amazing company. I stayed there for over 2 years but felt like I was never going to progress if I was just a filter and belt changer. I watched my buddies in residential be promoted to service technicians after 2 years in maintenance and got a bit jealous. I left my nice cushy company to go to another commercial company for $1 more per hour. Bad move. They fired my mom my first day in the field. I finished up the call that I was on and turned in the keys to my van. I was there for 4 days. Finding another job in HVAC with my experience level was extremely difficult. I had just moved out of my parents and in with my fiance at the time that I quit that job. It took 3 months of rigorously applying to all sorts of different positions. I even tried to become a cook at Chili’s and Applebee’s just to have some sort of income and end the constant fighting between myself and my future wife. I got into resi after 3 months of applying that was seemingly never going to end. Resi wasn’t bad but the company I work for is one of those PE companies that we talk so much about. They wanted me selling the top option to each customer. I’m a terrible salesman and on top of mistakes that I’ve made on calls (being new to actually maintaining units, not just changing filters and belts) a few days before Christmas 2024 I left the gas plug out of a furnace after taking a gas pressure reading and it completely charred the inside of the furnace. My manager told me to sit at home for a few days while he figured out what to do with me. I ended up getting written up and almost fired. They told me I could join their duct cleaning team or “part ways as friends”. Man I was completely defeated. I still needed a job so I accepted. I got as good as I possibly could at duct cleanings and got revenue flowing on the duct cleaning side. Only ethical selling— completely necessary repairs. My manager keeps asking me to go back into maintenance now and I won’t accept. No way will I be playing their reindeer games again. For nearly the past year of being a duct cleaner I’ve been upping my knowledge within the trade and I’m really impressed by the amount of growth I’ve been able to achieve just by pushing myself harder and more consistently. Now I’ve got job offers like this one that nearly made me tear up after all the hard times I’ve seen in this trade. My current crap employer pays me $18/ hour and doesn’t respect my time or knowledge/ experience. Big mistake. I’m way more comfortable with HVAC equipment now and I’m going to make one of my future employers happy to have me. Rant over. Sorry for the word vomit. This trade means a lot to me and I take pride in my work. This job offer that I just received a few days ago makes all the hard times worth it.\n\nTLDR: not every employer is going to treat you like dirt. Take your career into your own hands and push yourself when you’re at home, instead of scrolling Facebook take the time to learn something new in your field. It pays off MASSIVELY. Almost a $10/ pay raise from where I’m at and a bump in title. Not even union. My union interview is on Monday 29th",

While I somehow found a way to complete it and earn the classification of Journeyman Lineman; I cannot do the job. I found the apprenticeship to be so traumatizing, when I take a call I cannot get past feeling stressed, inadequate and full of anxiety, because I was demoralized and treated like shit for 3+years every day on the job, I lack confidence in my skills and ability and feel like I do not fit in. I forced myself to finish the program, thinking it would be and feel different when I topped out. No more getting treated like shit, feeling like shit, being constantly criticized and scrutinized in every and any way.\n\nI think the work environment and culture is completely toxic in every way. Aside from being treated like shit for years, I was shocked and still am by the way these grown men treat other grown men, no human should treat another the way they do and the way it is just accepted in the trade. Racism is rampant and widely accepted, which I find to be disgusting and unacceptable in any form. Locker room talk about women. Nepotism across the board. If you are part of the good ole' boys club you can get away with anything, if you're not, you are pushed out. I bet you can guess by now  I'm not a part of that club and never will be. I've not been able to keep a job more than 2-3 months since completing the apprenticeship a little over 2 years ago. All the guys will be decent to your face and talk shit to everyone behind your back like immature teenagers.  I've accepted it is not for me. I know  I'm not the only person that feels like this.\n\nAnother very fucking challenging part of my apprenticeship was the travel. I didn't work one day at home, I traveled for the whole thing.  My home local is a sticking local and all I did my whole apprenticeship was travel and glove. Topped out and was worthless as a JL at home which also fed and feeds into the lack of confidence piece. I asked the director of my program more than once to work local and get stick time and it fell on def ears. I've since traveled some and done some sticking, not a ton but I kinda get it.\n\nI'm most likely getting out of the trade, there is no amount of money worth my mental health. There are millions of people out there making a much better living than JL's working much less. We are glorified hole diggers. Too much machismo and ego. How you make your money is more important than how much you make. I've been unemployed more than employed since I topped out a little over 2 years ago. I get so much anxiety about the idea of being on the right of way I can't bring myself to sign the books. I've racked up more cc debt than I ever thought I would have. I'm not going to spend 2 days around people I don't care for, let alone 20 years just because \"it's a great job\". For some it is. For many it isn't, which explains high rates of divorce and all the alcohol and drug abuse. Just my 2 cents.",

The freezer label said it takes 640 grams (23.57 oz) of refrigerant.\n\nWe changed the compressor out and as well as the filter and really cleaned the condenser coil. The system has a capillary tube and no receiver.\n\nI still haven't got my own scale and his was left at his workshop so after pulling vaccum and making sure there's no leaks, I started chaging gas carefully (I did so as a liquid) and the system had one service port only (on the compressor itself). I charged slowly and could see the pressure on the gauge. I stopped when it stayed at 2 Bar (29 PSI) and the turned the sysem on. \n\nI have swapped several compressors and I was taught that when charging witout a scale, I should keep charging gradually till suction line close to the compressor starts getting really cold till is frosty or a layer of frost appears on it.\n\nBut this time I noticed two things, first, the condenser fans (two fans) were blowing cold air instead warm air. Second, the inside of the freezer wasn't getting cold at all, not one bit. \n\nI decided to keep charging very carefully (liquid through low side). The problem is I had no idea how much I was charging. Discharge line right at the compressor eventually reached 42C (108 F), and return line next to it, stayed at 16C (60F) and the low side pressure was 2.5 Bar (36 PSI) which pretty much the pressure for temperature needed in the evaporator when everything is unning smoothly. But again, no cold whatsoever inside the freezer, the shelves (two sets of evaporators) were warm and after two hours they got even warmer.\n\nIt was late so we shut off the system and lef cause the owners had to leave. I was convinced the refrigerant was not reaching the evporators due to something being clogged, perhaps the capilary tube or even the new filter.  The other tech thought that maybe the 1/4 line we brazed (on either side of the filter) was clogged due to poor brazing (this has happened to him in the past on an AC) \n\nToday he went back to the bakery and realized nothing was clogged and that the system had barely any refrigerant in it. He pulled vaccum, charged the right amount (this time using his scale) and the freezer started pulling down temperature in few minutes and is running great. \n\nI know this comes down to experiernce but how do I know I'm not overcharging when I'm doing it with no scale? For some older systems there's no info on it so charging by weight is impossible so relying on superheat may be the only option left. But I'm baffled that all refrigerant I charged (liquid refigerant) went \"missing\" into the system. Also, how am I supposed to charge liquid when there's no liquid receiver and no service port on the high side ir liquid line? I know there's vaporizers out there but haven't got one yet. \n\nThe other tech tells me that he's been charging R404a as gas for years and everything is fine. He's an old school guy. I did insist that refrigerants such as 404a gotta be charged as liquid only, but insisted that I could of damaged the compressor, which is also true.\n\nDo you guys have a rule of thumb when it comes to charging with no scale? How do you make sure you're not overcharging? Also, with no vaporizer, how can I charge liquid in a system like that when there's no service port on the high side and no receiver? Maybe I should have installed one myself prior to charging? \n",

      "text": "Recalling an event that happened last month: It was my first and last time working with this RT during NOC shift at a post-acute facility (2 RTs per shift). I had previously heard from multiple nurses and other RTs that this individual had a reputation for being lazy, frequently disappearing from the facility for extended periods, and accumulating multiple prior write-ups. I witnessed his incompetence first hand during a Code Blue on that same shift.\n\nI was notified by an nurse that a trach patient (that was assigned to the other RT ) was coding. By the time I arrived, CPR had already been in progress for 10 minutes (facility doesn't have microphone announcements to announce code blues, otherwise I would've been there sooner). I saw the RT bagging the trach patient when I got there. I offered to help take over bagging/help with chest compressions and what does he do? He immediately leaves the room instead of staying to help, and goes back to the  RT department to go on his phone.\n\nThe most egregious part, however, was that I immediately noticed the reservoir bag on the BVM was not inflated. Upon inspection, I realized that the other RT didn't even turn on the flowmeter regulator on the oxygen H-tanks (my facility doesn't have flowmeters connected to the wall). In addition, the pilot balloon on the trach was completely DEFLATED, meaning the patient was not ventilated properly at all. In short, the patient was receiving (or the lack there of) ROOM AIR oxygen, NOR was the patient being ventilation properly for the first 10 minutes of CPR. EMT finally arrived and she was transported to the hospital.\n\nI have no idea how he has a license. The charge nurse and I reported the incident to the supervisor, and the last I heard, he was fired. Personally, I think he should lose his license for this level of negligence.\n\nFeel free to share your incompetent healthcare worker stories!",

The next call had a 19xr Centrifugal. Carrier said they no longer offer technical support on equipment over 10 years old for chillers. Trying to get a hold of Trane tech support being told to call the local branch, they direct us to another state. Who directs us back. Then being told they can't help us?? So then we have to reach out to the salesman we order parts from asking if he can help and he submits a ticket for us.\n\nCalling multiple different OEM manufacturers giving my information and being called 1-3 days later consistently if I get a call back. For equipment that I've flown to their state for, paid 1500-2800 dollars for a week long class and still struggling to get a hold of support. Having to call the instructors and then them doing a favor and helping us get in touch with the right people.\n\nBrand new large tonnage equipment we sold to the customer and are certified in. Being forced to have OEM come in and do the start ups then trying to sell service contracts locking them in for 5+years. Customers who've been our account for 20 years.\n\nA manufacturers moving away from gateway pluggins to the new dongle plug-in which they said they won't sell to us you have to be a technician and I used to work for them. Then having a ton of service menus you cannot access for repairs or make changes to the equipment unless you're an employee.\n\nAnother saying they won't sell us the license to plug in and work on equipment even though we're certified. The customer calling who owns the equipment asking if they can buy it and being told no.\n\nTons of manufacturers moving to proprietary parts that we can only get from them. Generic things like motors.\n\nEquipment being far less serviceable so that you just replace parts instead of giving the option for repair.\n\nWe start up new equipment almost everyday and the amount of issues coming straight from factory. Being told the boiler doesn't leave until all satisfies have been wired and the boiler shows up without safeties wired and missing half the wiring for low voltage.\n\nI could go on and on. It's getting harder to be a tech when it seems every week we are hitting roadblocks that we have to find a work around for.\n\nMy coworkers and friends who work for competitors are experiencing the same issues. I've had a lot of friends leave the trade in the last 5 years due to the increasing headache. Customers are becoming frustrated with all of us. Even the OEM guys I know want to work on other OEM equipment. Not just their brand.\n\nI'm curious what the trade will be like in 10 years, but I think the direction we're heading in the pursuit of profit is wrong. We should have the right to repair and the customer should be able to choose who's service they want to use. Not be strong armed into this manufacturer because their the only ones who have the password.\n",

      "text": "\nIt confuses me why it’s so pressed upon dental people, especially hygienists to build so much rapport with patients and coddle them and be all happy and jovial all the time. \n\nI’m not close or have literally any rapport with any other person who has anything to do with my body? Not my gynecologist, not my chiropractor, not my masseurs, not my physician. Not anyone?? We only see them maybe one or two more times a year more than everyone else, but it’s expected that we build these happy fun relationships with patients.\n\nWhy can’t we just come to do a job?? Of course I’ll be nice but I like to keep it straight to the point. I don’t have energy to be buddy buddy with every patient all day bc then I have nothing left to give to my family and friends who truly matter to me back at home. Why is this the norm?? \n\nAll these job listings saying, we want someone who wants to be involved with patients and them as people and be jovial and loves getting to know and foster relationships with them. This isn’t therapy or a community center?!? I never see that sort of description on any other listing for any other healthcare job…\n\nI’m aware patients have dental anxiety. People also have healthcare anxiety period. I almost shit my pants when I have to get my blood drawn or get a Pap smear, but no one in there is tryna be my therapist or soothe me? They just do it and say are u ok? And that’s it..",

But at the same time why is our solution to take away from the people who are as a whole probably struggling and working the hardest? What are your thoughts?\n\nEdit: my district does pay based on experience. This specific teacher thinks new teachers salary should be lowered and the extra money should be given to older teachers.

These typically cost the homebuyers $500k or more to get into. Quality is dismal to put it nicely. Between cheap labor and materials, poor planning and questionable design choices, I can’t help but feel like the people buying these are getting duped. Combine that with the average home cost being almost 6x the average salary, this doesn’t seem like a sustainable market. \nNow bring in offsite manufactured housing. This doesn’t necessarily have to be your typical double wide trailer park, but fully customizable, solid built structures. Offsite building eliminates the inefficiency of subcontracted labor, shipping costs, wasted materials and scheduling kerfuffles. Quality control would is more manageable and people wouldn’t be buying shit homes for $500k+. I don’t understand why production developers who are pumping out 300+ new builds per year haven’t gone this route. Throw up a development with this mindset and you’d have quality homes that would be more accessible to the general public. ",

I'm also about to lose out on fully paid paramedic school with my salary covered. After months of repeated delays in diagnosis and insurance authorization (they initially thought my pelvis fracture was anxiety with bumps/bruises 😮‍💨), I'm about to have my restrictions lifted *one week* after the day that I'll lose my job. \n\nI love EMS. I've been in EMS for over 6 years, unable to afford paramedic school because of 130k of private loan student debt (initially 60k but interest snowballed). I'm realizing that I don't know who I am without EMS. My experiences have made it hard to relate to other people. My job accounts for most of my social interactions, my feelings of self worth, my purpose, my excitement, and my confidence. Being in EMS affects almost every aspect of my life. \n\nI'm absolutely devastated. I was so excited to finally become a paramedic. My EMT uniform has been on display in my room for 3 months as motivation to get better. I feel as though my future and my identity are being ripped away by the indifference and incompetence of others. Meanwhile, I'm rushing myself through PT trying to force a faster return (I'm so close!), but because of the fucking insurance authorizations, I just started pelvis PT last week. I have about 8 more days until the deadline. The bones have long since healed, but my musculature is a little fucked up. While doing PT, I strained my neck 🤬. Pushing through the neck strain to rehab everything else, the neck strain is getting WAY worse, and I'm *constantly* in pain. It's been 6 days, and I can't stand up straight. \n\nI'm not usually one to complain..., but this really fucking sucks.Things are really rough right now. Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated. \n😮‍💨",

      "title": "Got fired yesterday.",
      "text": "First time in the field, I was hired in about 6 months ago at a specialty personal injury firm. I was still in school, and had just started my final semester in my paralegal program at the community college. They knew I had no experience when they hired me, and seemed eager to train me.\n\nUltimately, the reason I was given for being fired was that the learning curve was steeper than they thought it would be and that they needed someone with more experience. I received maybe 2 days of training, and one of those was with the legal assistant. I was given a bunch of cases and no direction after about a month. I flailed my way through, and sure, my work product could have been better, but they knew I had no experience working in a law firm when I was hired. I was following the directions I was given, and they refused to elaborate on the Bigger Picture when I asked. \n\nI felt my way through the pre-lit process and was starting to feel like I actually understood what we were doing. But I guess they had already given up on me. I saw the writing on the wall, honestly. I was kind of brushed aside. My questions and requests for tasks often went unanswered. I spent much of the past month just twiddling my thumbs. The attorney I worked for would send me emails asking for my thoughts about certain situations, and then would ghost me when I gave him my answers. A month or two ago, they started talking about bringing on another attorney, and then an off-shore paralegal. They both started this week, and I guess it left me as the odd man out. And so I got the Ol' Stanky Boot.\n\nTruthfully, I was getting kind of sick of the job anyway. I realized a couple months into it that we were a settlement mill. Our team got our clients *exclusively* as referrals from Top Dog Law. If you're familiar with Top Dog, you'll know what I mean. I feel that roughly 50% of our clients were trying to scam in one way or another. The majority of the ones I dealt with were non-responsive or incorrigible. It was nearly impossible to get any of them to follow instructions, and especially when I only half-knew what I was talking about.\n\nMy biggest concern is that taking this role may have ruined me and my expectations for where I should be at this stage in my career. The job was by far the best I've ever had after working ~20 years in the service industry. Hybrid schedule, wfh 3 days per week. $55k salary with full health and 15 days PTO. I was quite content to stay here for a couple years and gain some experience while finishing my bachelor's degree. \n\nTruthfully, I was kind of surprised to land such a lucrative role with no experience working in law. It's my intuition that the senior paralegal really pushed for me to get hired, but for her own purposes. I feel like she liked me because I was non-threatening. I am a guy and had no experience. She is a woman who has over 20 years of experience. After interacting with the team for the time I was there, I think she was trying to protect her own status as Queen Bitch of the firm, so to speak (I say this in a positive manner, not a derogatory one. I've got no ill will).\n\nThe CEO fired me because my former attorney is a coward and had him do it while he was out on vacation. He said that both himself and my former attorney were willing to be references on my job search, and offered me some leads if I was interested. He said that my work product was good and that everyone who worked with me only had positive things to say.\n\nShort term, I'll be fine. My partner is amazing and we have been discussing our options. However, I don't know that I can force myself to take another job paying $10-15k less that's going to require me to go into the office 5 days per week. I don't want to have to start over earning my PTO, which probably won't be near as good as it was. It just sucks to have to start over when I was finally settling in.\n\nOk, rant over. I just had to get these thoughts out. Make me feel better? Make me feel worse? Tell me a funny or relatable story? Idk, do what you do, paralegals of Reddit.",

They truly encouraged learning, they let me tag along to any &amp; everything &amp; help even in little ways like running for supplies. \n\nThe people who let me simply just be around saved a couple lives today! I got to watch them do a serious burn ONE time, I learned about burn ties, airway burns, ventilating, and even how the skin can get so tight they may not be able to breathe &amp; need a faschiotomy. \n\nNow one year later I’m at a level 1 but we aren’t a burn center. We had a BAD complex fire this morning &amp; I went down to help respond with about 4 other people who were all new grads or about the same level of experience that I have. That ONE time I got to help / learn came right back into my head today and I got to give a crash course in real time about burn ties instead of tape / hollister &amp; ventilating smoke inhalation. It wasn’t pretty, it definitely wasn’t smooth, but me &amp; my coworkers were able to at least secure our tubes, not trust the pulse ox, get a COhb, and get the patients stable enough to transfer. \n\nI know taking students or even taking the ones working in the department through school can be a pain in the butt, but that one single thing you let them tag along for can really stick &amp; prepare them better for the real world. \n\nThank you to everyone who doesn’t mind having a shadow that’s “just happy to be here”. Thank you for taking the time to show people and to answer questions. You guys save lives of people you will never even touch. You make the world a better and safer place for anyone who finds theirself sick or hurt. You may never even know it, but you have a huge impact! Thank you thank you thank you ",

I’ve built a really good clientele of at least 100 regulars who support me and i’m super grateful, i do private caterings and dinners on the side as well as a part time job in nice italian spot mon-thursday. The owners of the brewery I most frequently pop up to want to buy a food truck and have me run it. Im excited about the opportunity, but want to ask my favorite subreddit to weigh in. Essentially, they would buy it, get it licensed and do the marketing. I would just have to come up with menus, and run the operation. I’m just not sure what to negotiate pay wise, would it make more sense to negotiate for a salary, or a percentage of profits. One thing that kills me is i’ve been the sole owner of my food venture and it feels fucking amazing to make all the money, and i understand that won’t be the case if i go forward with this. Although I get the opportunity to build a brand and name as a local chef with no investment. Have any of you been in a similar position? If so any advice or guidance would be really helpful. Right now i’m making probably 75k with my part time job and weekend pop ups, but i’m working a ton and i’m all over the place these days, would like to just focus on one thing. ",

I have a masters degree in cyber security from WGU and have the sec+, net+, cysa+, secx, SAL1, and az-900 certifications.\n My job is VERY comfy. I work for about 2 hours and the rest of the day I study for new certifications or watch YouTube videos. I have zero stress at my job which allows me to focus on my health and wellness. It's a very stable job and I have great benefits as part of a union.\n\nUnfortunately, the job doesn't pay enough. I just got married and we are planning to buy a house and have a kid. I'm looking at other opportunities but all I see are contact jobs for 3-6 months. Even though they pay more they are not stable. \n\nI could just stick it out at my current easy job and wait for pay raises which will happen. Eventually the 3% raise every year will become a six figure salary even if it takes a while. Or I could get a new job that pays well but might not be as stable with alot more stress.\n\nWhat do you guys think and what would you do in my shoes?  ",

I’ve gotten to a point where I’ve been pretty boring after automating everything I can. The only issue is that there is no room for promotion internally and is why people on the team have left in the past.

I’m single, 27, no girlfriend/kids so I would love to travel if it happens.\n\nI’m looking for advice based off my current variables because I hear consulting is a lot of work. Would this open up doors for me in the future? Is it worth it to get the senior title and compensation increase? Anything I should know about what I would be getting myself into? I know money isn’t everything, so I’m having a hard time making this decision. I would hate to give up something great, but even if 1-2 years could set me up better for the future then I think it could be worth while. Am I crazy for being reluctant about this?",

It’s the foundation, and a pt can’t demonstrate a commitment to their oral health, I won’t give diagnose implants on them or other restorative options due to them not being compliant.\n\nAnyway, I started working at this new job and I’m… not really happy. I keep seeing pts who have been seen regularly, and have Perio disease with calculus caked on their teeth and evident in their radiographs. Some of these pts even have a history of SRP being completed in the last year. However, is it possible to get calculus to such as extent, in such a short amount of time?\n\nThe dentist previous to me at this location refused to have a hygienist. In fact, all the docs in this area refuse to have a hygienist because they want to take home the production that they make from prophy and SRP (laughable, really. You’re telling me you can’t make up the difference with treatment?). But you tell me, is it even possible to give everyone a prophy and/or SRP of 2 quads in less then 20 minutes alongside restorations in that same 1 hour appointment?! I don’t think so. And I’m seeing the clear evidence of this. \n\nOffice has piezo scalers but DAs don’t know they have different tips. I had to look it up because I’ve never worked with piezo scalers, only cavitron. They give me one universal supragingival scaler tip. One random scaler (could be anything, 13/14, /\n15/16, universal, jaquette, literally makes zero sense). No UNC probes, only plastic with 3mm markings. No 11/12 explorer, no nabers probe, etc.\n\nAm I missing something here, or am I the stupid one? Why are these docs neglecting Perio health?!",

I am someone who has gotten extremely lucky with my timing in this industry, started my flight training and my four-year aviation degree in 2016, finished instructing, and got my hours to go to an airline in 2021 and yes before anyone says anything I was one of those people who fell for the marketing scheme of the big college 141 flight school, but i mean it worked out. Anyway, I spent 7 months at Envoy before leaving for my current job. I currently fly a Gulfstream G600 and the 650 for a billionaire family. Living in my hometown I grew up in with one toddler and hopefully one more on the way. The family also own a Kodiak for their ranch trip, and honestly, that is more fun than the Gulfstream. I make about 215K a year from them in salary, and they also pay for my type rating and recurrent training. I usually only fly 2-6 times a month for them, and it's usually 2, not 6. They also give about a 18 days notice before they need us, and not a single time in the last 4 years have I been called on Christmas or Thanksgiving the closest thing to that was getting called on 4th of july in 2023. Because of this, I'm able to do contract trips, which for the Gulfstream pay about 9-14k a day. Last year, I was able to make as much as a legacy NB captain. If you Google my boss, you're going to see that this guy is rich as hell, which means that this job is exceptionally stable and recession-proof. More than that, this guy is just nice, like overall just a nice, caring gentleman who treats everyone with kindness, and so does his family. The thing is, I recently got a CJO with United. My dream job when I was a kid. A Legacy for God's sake. However I would have to commute. It's a 45 minutes drive to the airport plus an hour and 15 flight to the closest United Base but luckily it's the most junior so I'll be holding it out of training. I think I already made my decision but I just want to hear some more opinions. I will probably never leave my hometown so I'll probably have to commute for the rest of my carrer. Is it worth leaving a 91 unicorn for a legacy. A job where i pretty much control my own schedule and get all the holidays and days I want off.  On the other side being 27 and at the Legacy isn't too bad either. The thing I'm losing out on staying is the massive 401K contribution, travel benefits, and the biggest of all, my lifelong childhood dream of flying a widebody for a legacy.\n\nEdit: What if the situation changes... Not saying I would get an offer at Delta, but I have my apps in. I live 45 minutes away from their base, which means given some seniority, I wouldn't be commuting.",

      "text": "So, I had previously posted on this sub on how to study for nursing school when you have terrible ADHD. I specifically posted it to help give me pointers for pathophysiology… and after locking in I got 95+ on my last two exams!  What I learned is that since my attention span is horrible, I have to look at my notes EVERY SINGLE DAY. You may be thinking, “shouldn’t you do that any way” well yes, but the thought of that makes me cry. I’m not talking about looking at them every single day for hours either. What I did is I look at my notes for as long as I can stand it each day. Could be 15 minutes or hours (even when I tried to study for over an hour I ended up on tiktok), no matter the time or place. I have google docs on my phone so if I’m dozing off, I just pull up my study guide and read it so it can put me to sleep. The more you look at it little by little, eventually things will start to click. I have 2-3 weeks between each exam and so right when I finished my last patho exam I booted next weeks notes or chapters to get ahead. So I’m exposing myself to the material for 14+ days straight. If I got bored I uploaded my notes into NotebookLM and told it to “explain thoroughly in Gen Z lingo”, while I scrolled on twitter. The audio is actually fun to listen to when they suddenly bring up “clocking” oncogenes. I also did nclex style practice questions almost every single day. I did read the book but I didn’t *read* the book. For each disorder I just looked up the pathophysiology, why it happens and contributing factors so I never have to open my book after that. Then, I highlight it and then I copy and paste it into google docs and just read that. Whiteboard method does work but I hate actually having to get up and write things when I just want to be lazy. If I didn’t understand the topic, I just closed my eyes and repeated it to myself until it clicked. Before taking the exam I would read over my study guide and notes for an hour straight then full send. I don’t look at my phone at all before taking it. Having discipline is key. I still struggle with it but this is a good balance for me. Find the method that works for you! I thought I was going to fail patho with flying colors, but I’m onto my next semester! Good luck on finals everyone!! Nursing school is hard but you can do hard things! ",

      "text": "I’m finishing up my undergrad in cybersecurity this year and have been working at an MSP as an analyst for 2 months. Now that I’ve touched some real work experience and am finishing up my degree I don’t know if I can see myself sitting in meetings and frying my brain all day doing this until I’m 65 working 9-5 monday to friday. I’ve been thinking about making the jump to the reserves in the military as an officer with a cyber focus but getting into law enforcement as a full time career. I know the long term salary potential is lower than in cyber but the benefits are good and I wouldn’t be sitting around all day. Granted this first job is pretty rough on hours and workload, so maybe I’m just not thinking straight and am wasting my degree. Any insight is appreciated.",

Training, exams, &amp; licenses are all paid by them (I already have my SIE and L/H but still need my 7/66). The base salary is good for this space for a new hire, the first year commission rate is standard, the bennies are excellent (I’m mostly excited about the free gym and 401k employee match). I am incredibly grateful for this opportunity, but I also acknowledge that I may not succeed as a financial advisor since so many FAs fail and attrition is brutal.

I was finally offered a position and I accepted it.  I turned in my 2 weeks tonight.  My emotions are all over the place.\n\nIt feels so bittersweet.  I have loved the job itself.  I dedicated my life to it though and I feel like I have gotten nothing out of it.  I have been on night shift, working every weekend and every holiday since I started.  My relationship failed early on in my career due to the difficult schedule, I have missed so many family events and gatherings, I gave up on my favorite sport because I could never get weekends off to go compete.  Our agency is constantly understaffed, our management is awful and disconnected, mandates are rampant, OT is out of control,  coworker drama is never ending and hard to avoid, it's extremely difficult to get vacation or comp days approved if you are lower in seniority... I can handle the calls and the radio traffic, in fact, I still enjoy this part of my job a lot.  But everything else with this job has mentally torn me apart.  I am in therapy, not because of the traumatic calls, but because of coworkers who have continuously bullied me and made this workplace an extremely difficult place to be, especially when I have to be here 50-60 hours a week.  I wish it had turned out differently.  I hate to leave it behind but I got to a point where I felt I didn't have a choice anymore but to try to get out.  ",

      "title": "Interested in full remote P&amp;C modeling job?",
      "text": "**TL;DR:** Team is hiring multiple individual contributor data scientist roles at various levels (5+ yr, 7+ yr, and possibly one level above). Fully remote position, FCAS preferred. Non-traditional role with competitive compensation including RSUs (public stock that can be sold after vesting). DM me for a transparent/honest chat about the role, and I will recommend qualified candidates directly to the manager.\n\nMy manager is hiring, and I'm sharing here because I think actuaries with modeling experience are a really good fit for this role! The team has historically been a mix of actuaries and PhDs. We have multiple openings because we had difficulty backfilling after internal rotations/departures around the time RTO hybrid was enforced. Remote work was not considered until very recently, when upper management granted an exception.\n\n**Must-haves:**\n\n* Strong understanding of probability and statistics (as covered in CAS prelim exams), including probability distributions commonly used in P&amp;C\n* Strong modeling skills and experience, including complex feature engineering, GLM, Tree models, etc. (DL/NLP/Vision/LLM not required). Python preferred, but can consider someone with strong R experience if willing to learn Python\n* Proficiency in data manipulation with huge datasets (pandas, SQL; others like Spark are a plus)\n* 5+, 7+, or above years (2-3 different job levels) of work experience in predictive modeling/data science focused role. FCAS or advanced degree.\n\n**Nice-to-have** (should have 2-3 of these to be competitive): Because finding someone with all these skills is impossible, we're flexible depending on other hires' skillsets:\n\n* Writing clean code, reproducibility, production-ready code, versioning, git/docker – can learn on the job\n* Experience in end-to-end ML/data pipeline and working with MLops and Data engineers\n* AWS experience (Sagemaker, S3, Redshift, Glue, EC2, EMR, MWAA, etc.) – can learn after joining\n* Expertise in building models with limited or no data for new types of exposure\n* Cat modeling (building it, not running it) experience and knowledge in correlation/dependencies/copulas etc. (if relatively weak on DS modeling skills, there might be an opportunity to get started with cat model first then contribute to predictive models later)\n\nI recommend these roles to people who want to keep pursuing IC in their mid-career and enjoy hands-on technical work. In some companies, promotions and salary progression are often limited unless you move into management, which some actuaries prefer not to. I believe the highest point you can reach as an IC here is higher than typical. This is not the best option for those in their mid-career looking to move up the management ladder in the next few years.\n\n**Pros:**\n\n* Fully remote\n* Use latest technology while leveraging actuarial knowledge\n* Good WLB and great compensation with bonus and RSU, plus excellent benefits package and unique perks (DM me for details on this)\n* Work closely with MLops teams and DE teams, with chances to improve engineering skills\n* Lots of paid/internal learning opportunities, conference opportunities\n* Option to interface with clients if you want that experience\n* No micro-management\n\n**Cons:**\n\n* Limited opportunity to move up to management level within the department – However, there are rotations and other job opportunities in different products for actuaries/DS after 2-year tenure\n* No exam support (FCAS preferred). FCAS/MAAA fees are covered\n\n**Exit paths I've seen:** Historically, past team members have rotated internally to different analytics products, gone back to insurance companies/insurtechs, moved to non-insurance tech companies as DS/ML, or become PMs, etc. It depends on what skills you develop here.\n\n**Next steps if interested:** I decided not to make a throwaway account because I've made many contributions to this subreddit with this account, and some people know my identity. However, I don't want to be too openly public and expose my identity in other subreddits I use. So I will be sharing details over DM beyond what's provided here. Feel free to contact me anonymously if you prefer. Ask questions, and I will try to be transparent. Send your resume, redacted resume, or summary of your experience if you want, which will save us some time. If there seems to be alignment, we can take it to LinkedIn or have a call, depending on your preference. For qualified candidates, I will make recommendations directly to the manager to speed up the process.",

      "text": "I am utterly disheartened by the lack of advancement, opportunity and stagnation that is occurring in the field of occupational therapy. I am seeking an exit to greener pastures to find a profession that offers social mobility, career advancement and fair compensation for efforts rendered. I find that the majority of companies I have worked for or interacted with (this is only getting worse with recent macro and geo political trends) aim to pay as little as possible and suck as much profit out of clinicians as possible (productivity police) while other professions such as nursing have an abundance of opportunities with much higher compensation (where’s the OT union at y’all?). I come to Reddit looking for hope as a present OT seeking an exit out of this melting career path which in my humble opinion is over sold by academia and top job lists designed to take your money and spit you out with a degree that will barely earn you enough to support a family without relying on an additional part to full time salary as a masters or doctorate level clinician. Not to mention you face a 0-3% wage increase at most companies you will work at for the remainder of your career requiring you to job hop annually to keep up with inflation until your wage tops out at 40-50 bones per HR. I love working with my patients and helping them achieve their goals but the typical 60-80k salary per year compensation for most OTs is laughable compared to the investment required and I would tell anyone to avoid this field on the ROI alone unless it is your dream and/or you are independently wealthy without requiring student loans or debt. I apologize for the negative tone of my post but I am utterly disappointed in the field of OT and am looking for any glimmer of hope one may have to offer regarding finding the light out of this very dark tunnel.

I told her that’s busy, even for accelerated hygiene, and she snarked back, “well, I could stack it.” That moment hit me hard—I think I’ve reached my limit with dental hygiene.\n\nI’m in my second year as a hygienist. I’ve bounced between several offices and temped, trying to find the right fit. No office is perfect, but what I’ve seen is discouraging: pressure to upsell regardless of need, falsified records to boost profits, insurance fraud, double-columned schedules with no support. The business model feels broken—it’s about money, not care—and it’s drained my passion for working in-office.\n\nYes, I enjoy the pay and those rare moments of connecting with patients, but the constant push for production in 30–45 minute blocks leaves no time for real care. My current office at least gives me an assistant, but the schedule is inconsistent, treatment plans are often ignored, patients run late but are still seen, and I end up cutting corners just to keep up. By week’s end, I’m physically hurting, mentally drained, and questioning why I’m even here.\n\nI didn’t choose this field to rush through people—I wanted to build relationships and provide care. Instead, I feel like I’m doing the bare minimum while the system sees me only as a revenue generator. I’ve tried to give feedback, but it’s brushed aside and the chaos continues. There’s little culture or connection—it’s just work, then leave. Maybe it’s Nevada’s corporate, money-driven model, but it’s left a bad taste in my mouth about hygiene in general.\n\nI respect my team and doctor for their feedback and support, but ultimately, I don’t see myself in this field much longer. I’m already working toward my master’s, where I hope to transition into a role that lets me help others in a more sustainable and meaningful way.\n\n**TL;DR:** I’m two years into dental hygiene, but the profit-driven business model, unrealistic scheduling, and lack of real patient care have burned me out physically and mentally. While I value patient connections and teamwork, I can’t see myself staying in this system. I’m pursuing my master’s to move into a more impactful, sustainable career helping people outside of the operatory.",

With the rise of artificial intelligence, do you think it will actually help expand our role? Because honestly, community pharmacy is going to die if the “test and treat” model doesn’t move forward.\n\nOur salaries are stagnant that is crazy I think wages will remain stagnant with this technology thing.\n\n\n\n\nPharmacists in Florida don’t make much compared to other states. 🤡",

I have a great job with employers who really build me up and treat me fantastic. \n   A few weeks ago I had a patient literally leave mid appointment because he couldn’t stand the scraping on his teeth. He assured me it wasn’t anything I did wrong, it was just him. I still felt like I failed him. \n   A couple of days later I had a crazy heavy SRP. I took a post op BWX, and it was perfect. I felt redeemed.\n   Today I was shown a review praising a part time hygienist, and implying she told this patient I left calculus behind at the last appointment. I checked the intra oral photos, and even a first year hygiene student would not have left that behind. I know 100% I didn’t leave that behind. \n   My last patient today was extremely nervous and scared. I talked to her before I started and assured her this would an easy appointment. I explained every step as I went. The patient had a few tears, but very cooperative. At the end she was very happy with the way her teeth looked and thanked me. I offered to put her on my schedule for her next cleaning, and she readily accepted. \n   So…the point? Don’t let unhappy patients ruin your confidence! Most of my patients are very happy, thank me, and compliment my thoroughness. I do beat myself up when someone isn’t happy, but then I take a deep breath and give the next patient my all. ",

I FULLY understand that students are responsible for the majority of the requirements to ensure they move on. Like in clinicals, you need to FIND experiences, especially to get skills checked off. I do this all the time. I got to do a straight catch on an Indiana pouch this way. \n\nMaybe I need to restate that these students have done all the communication possible with our ADON on this.

      "text": "Hi everyone!  I’m a real estate agent in Brazil and our market works *very* differently compared to the US. I’d love to share a few facts that usually surprise international agents, and I’m curious about your reactions.\n\nHere are some realities of how things often work here:\n\n* Exclusive listings are rare — the same property is usually listed with multiple agents.\n* There’s no true MLS system, so agents spend a lot of time “hunting” for listings and confirming availability directly.\n* **There’s no concept of a “buyer’s agent.”** Agents mainly represent the seller, and buyers often just reach out to whoever has the listing. Because of this, the competition to *capture and mantain listings* is extremely fierce.\n* Clients often contact several agents at once for the same property.\n* 🚨 **For new condo developments:** agents do “sales shifts” at the developer’s stand. Shifts are 8 hours long, no salary, only commission (\\~1.5%).\n* At these stands, there can be 30+ agents from different brokerages working together. Potential buyers who walk in are assigned by a *daily lottery system*. If you’re unlucky and get the last spot in the draw, you might spend the whole day without speaking to a single client.\n\nI’m gathering reactions to these differences to create content for my Instagram, showing how real estate practices vary around the world.\n\n👉 If you reply, please note that I may share your comment (translated) on Instagram. If you’d like to be credited, include your u/handle so I can tag you.\n\nHow would you feel working in a market like this? What do you think would be the hardest part?",

      "text": "I understand that many here are career dispatchers with much more experience than me. After experiencing what I experienced only a year and a half into my career I want to try to help provide others with the tools to try beginning the healing process after a traumatic event.\n\nI know that many of us have experienced trauma at some point in our careers as dispatchers. I had someone suggest to me of writing a letter about the incident as a means to seek some closure or relief from the call. This letter is going to be the ending that you never got to say. Your goodbye, your heart, your pain, your hope that they heard you, and your reminder to yourself: \"I stayed and did not let them go alone.\"\n\nI have dealt with this feeling of guilt and fear since the incident. Tonight, I finally made the choice to do this, and I feel a lot better. Tonight was a struggle emotionally until I had gotten my letter written. I know that with reddit things can be made public such as sharing and all that. I want to give everyone here who has had that experience to write anonymously what they wish they could say to that caller if they would have known it was the end. I have included my letter as an example. I would love to hear what others have to say about what they have experienced but this letter can be kept to yourself . I just hope that if there are some people out there struggling that they are able to use this as a place to start. \n\nif you are willing to share your letter here (following community rules of course) please do so. I know that I am not the only one. \n\n\n\n(Caller), I know that you do not know me, but I took calls from you prior to that dreadful night. That night, I didn’t know that it was going to be your final moments—not until after it had already passed. Even after it had passed, I still clung to hope that you would somehow answer the phone, or I would hear officers call out that they were with you. Answering your call for help, I knew something was wrong, but I did not know what it was. I sent help to you as fast as I could. Your delayed responses told me that something was wrong, but I couldn’t put my finger on what had happened. I saw the history with your phone number, but nothing could have prepared me for what you were about to tell me. \n\n“My husband is shooting me!!” You telling me about your husband shooting you caught me off guard. I knew that help was on the way but this is where I had stumbled. I had felt as if something had changed. There was a new stiffness in the air as I continued to question you about where your husband was and who else was there with you. I know that we had discussed how to try to stop the bleeding as well. Then I heard one last gunshot from on the phone. My heart sank; I could no longer hear your breaths. All I could hear was what was going on the background. I could hear your dogs whimpering around the phone. This I believe now was them trying to get you to respond. I could hear officers yelling into the house for someone to come out. \n\nI clung to our phone call still even after I heard the gunshot. I continued to try to get you to answer me. I tried to get you to go to the door. I kept telling you the officers are there to help you and to keep trying to get to the door and they WILL help you. My coworker called your husband and when he told us that you were no longer apart of the land of the living we asked how he knows. He stated, “because I shot her.” I knew that I could not stay on the phone with you any longer because there were other calls that needed to be answered. I continued to help not only your friends but people who knew your husband continue to help officers in trying to get him to come out of the house peacefully. I reassured people who you were close with that we had help there and that we were doing everything we could. You were not supposed to die like that. You didn’t deserve that. \n\nWhat I want you to know is that I tried my hardest to get help to you as fast as possible. Even though it was not until close to when you passed; you telling me that your husband was shooting you saved so many lives that night. It was not me who saved them. YOU DID THAT. Since then, I still carry your voice with me and saying that your husband is shooting you. That night changed me, and I wish I would have gotten Police there sooner. \n\nYour voice has stayed with me along with the other things that were said in the background. Your voice is the clearest of all of them all. The silence after the gunshot is what has stayed and haunted me beyond just your voice. You may not have heard me, but I believe that somehow part of you knew that I was there. I did not leave you. Sometimes I still wonder what else I could have done better or more to save you. I know that I tried to walk you through how to try to stop the bleeding. I know that I showed up when you needed me the most. I stayed with you so you were not alone. I gave everything I had in that moment, and you were not alone in the end. \n\nI am choosing to let this moment go—not to forget, but to release the grip that this has had on my heart. This pain is real, but I cannot live inside it forever. YOU MATTERED. YOU STILL MATTER. And I WILL carry your memory forward not as a wound but as a reason to keep caring.",

I am the only paralegal in the office, so while I mainly work for him, I also do work for the one other attorney in the office. It is also important to note that he is the owner of the firm, so he signs the paychecks, etc.\n\nWithin the office there are 2 attorneys, one file room person, and one secretary.\n\nToday I heard some chatter about the Christmas bonus and how they were distributed. I didn’t find mine in my box like other people, but I didn’t plan to inquire about it because I feel like at a small firm, unless you’re an attorney, bonuses aren’t really expected.\n\nMy boss came into my office and asked to speak with me, and he told me that he distributed the bonuses but that I wouldn’t be getting one (every other person in the office got one). Yeah, I was disappointed but I didn’t think a whole lot of it until he continued on and gave his reasoning as to why. He told me that the reason I wasn’t getting one was because my hours and overtime (I’m hourly, not salary) have been so substantial (I average about 10-12 hrs OT/week) that I have become the highest paid person in the office (excluding attorneys).\n\nThis comment is when I became offended. We have 4 major trials coming up in 2026 and I am the only person doing the “scut” prep in addition to the other paralegal duties I am doing for the smaller clients not going to trial. Earlier in the year when I started prepping, I asked him if he was okay with the hours I was working and weekends I was working, to which he said he was because my research and other work product needed to be done and those things I was working on required mass amounts of time. But now, because of those hours I’m working, I don’t get a bonus. I think at this point it isn’t even about the money, but the fact that his reasoning behind him not giving me one was because of the long and hard hours that I have put in. To twist the knife even more, he ended the conversation by saying that I was “a huge asset and indispensable to the firm.”\n\nI will say, I am applying to law school and he has been a huge help in that process by giving me advice, LORs, and helping me edit my personal statement. I feel like I have sacrificed a lot of my time and energy for this job, and I think I am more hurt by the lack of appreciation for it than I am about the money.\n\nAm I in the wrong for feeling offended? Do you all have any advice as to what I should do?\n\nEDIT: This is the first firm I have worked in as a paralegal, so I’m not really sure the “norm” for paralegals. Prior to this, I worked as a secretary at another law firm for 3 years in which we never got bonuses so I’m not really sure what to do. We also haven’t gotten bonuses at this firm that I’m a paralegal at before and this is the first year he has done them (at least to my knowledge).",

      "text": "I'm hoping some experienced folks can give some insight. I am a data engineer and architect who worked his way up from analytics engineer. I've built end-to-end pipelines that served data scientists, visualizations, applications, or other groups data platforms numerous times. I can do everything from the DataOps / MLOps to the actual analytics if needed (I have an academic ML background). I can also troubleshoot pipelines that see large volumes of users on the application end and my last technical role was as an architect/ reliability engineer consulting across many different sized companies.\n\nI've finally secured a more leadership-type position as the principal data strategist (I have no interest in being middle management leading technical groups). The issue is the company is in the construction sector and largely only uses Microsoft365. There is some Azure usage that is currently locked down by IT and they won't even give me read-only access. There is no one at the company who understands cloud concepts or software engineering -- the Azure env is set up from consoles, there is no versioning (like no Git let alone Yaml), and the CIO doesn't even understand containers. The engineers vibe code and if they need an application demo for a client, they'll vibe the python and use Streamlit and put it on a free public server.\n\nI'm honestly beside myself and don't know what to do about the environment in general. IT is largely incompetent when it comes to any sort of modern practices and there's a lot of nepotism so no one gets fired and if you aren't related to someone, you're shit out of luck.\n\nI'm trying to figure out what to do here.  \nPros:  \n\\- I have the elevated title so I feel like that raises me to a different \"social level\" as I find higher leaders are now wanting to engage with me on LinkedIn  \n\\- Right now I kind of have a very flexible schedule and can decide how I want to structure my day. That is very different from other roles I've been in that had mandatory standups and JIRAs and all that jazz  \n\\- This gives me time to think about pet projects.\n\n\\- Adding a pro I forgot to add -- there is room for me to kind of learn this type of position (more leadership, less tech) and make mistakes. There's no one else gunning for this position (they kind of made it for me) so I have no fear of testing something out and then having it fail -- whether that's an idea, a communication style, a long term strategy map, etc. They don't know what to expect from me honestly so I have the freedom to kind of make something up. The fear is that nothing ends up being accepted as actionable due to the culture of not wanting to change processes.\n\nCons:  \n\\- I'm paid 'ok' but nothing special. I gave up a $40k higher salary when I took this position.  \n\\- There is absolutely no one who can talk about modern software. It's all vibe coders who try to use LLMs for everything. There is absolutely no structure to the company either -- everyone is silo'ed and everyone does what they want so there's just random Python notebooks all over Sharepoint, random csv files where ever, etc  \n\\- The company is very old school so everything is Microsoft365. I can't even get a true Azure playground. if I want to develop on the cloud, I'll need to buy my own subscription. I'm forced to use a PC.  \n\\- I feel like it's going to be hard to stay current, but I do have colleagues to talk to from previous jobs who are current and intelligent.  \n\\- My day to day is extremely frustrating because no one understands software in the slightest. I'm still trying to figure out what I can even suggest to improve their data issues.  \nThere are no allies since IT is so locked down (I can't even get answers to questions from them) and their leader doesn't understand cloud or software engineering. Also no one at the company wants to change their ways in the slightest.\n\nRight now my plan is: (this is what I'm asking for feedback on)  \n\\- Try to make it here at least 2 years and use the elevated title to network -- I suck at networking though so can you give some pointers?  \n\\- use this time to grow my brand. Post to Medium, post to LinkedIn about current topics and any pet projects I can come up with.  \n\\- Take some MBA level courses as I will admit that I have no business background and if I want to try to align to business goals, I have to understand how businesses (larger businesses) work.  \n\\- Try to stay current -- this is the hard one -- I'm not sure if I should just start paying out the nose for my own cloud playground? My biggest shortcoming is never building a high volume streaming pipeline end-to-end. I understand all the tech and I've designed such pipelines for clients, but have never had to build and work in one day to day which would reveal many more things to take into consideration. To do this on my own may be $$$. I will be looking for side consulting jobs to try to stay in the game as well.  \n\\- I'm hoping that if I can stay just current enough and add in business strategy skills, I'd be a unique candidate for some high level roles? All my career people have always told me that I'm different because I'm a really intelligent person who actually has social skills (I have a lot of interesting hobbies that I can connect with others over).\n\nOr I could bounce, make $45k+ more and go back into a higher pressure, faster moving env as a Lead Data Architect/ engineer. I kind of don't want to do that bc I do need a temporary break from the startup world.  \nIf I wait and try to move toward director of data platform, I could make at least $75k more, but I guess I'm not sure what to do between now and then to make sure I could score that sort of title considering it's going to be REALLY hard to prove my strategy can create movement at this current company.

It's a smaller rehab hospital, with a very great, understanding boss. She really is an angel and encourages my husband to leave during the day so he doesn't miss little things like elementary school spelling bee or spring musical performance. He is a few minutes late every single day because he drops off kids at school on his way and it's just fine. He can leave at the end of the day when work is done, even if it's not quite 6. It's really a great place to work.\n\n\nThe down side is living in Yuma, AZ.

      "text": "Hi Folks,\n\nThe title is a little bit bold but nevertheless it is what is concerning me and many others for a while. I love this community, this is where I started using Reddit so it's the place imo I should discuss this.\n\nI'm ~~founder~~ engineer and janitor of prepare sh, you probably seen it being discussed here, but today I want to talk about something else. Never in my life I thought I'd be thinking \"shall I quit tech?\", \"is it a viable career?\", \"is there a **future in Tech?**\"\n\nI see daily posts of desperation from young folks, applying for 300-400 jobs in a short matter of time to be ghosted, rejected, disrespected by companies sending AI interviewers showing how invaluable engineers are that they don't even assign a real person to conduct an interview.\n\nI believe STEM path requires certain aptitude and resilience, and those people could have easily become something else like Doctors, Mechanics, etc. and wouldn't witness (not to this degree) never ending vicious cycle of upskilling, ageism, and layoffs.\n\nI'm not saying doctors, and other professions have it easy, but there are many specialties such as dentistry etc that pay very well, are extremely stable and simply can never be outsourced. You go through some shit to get there but once you're there by say 35 or so, you're pretty much set for life. And with more experience you only become more valuable, unlike tech where you're on the hamster wheel of constant upskilling just to not fall behind. And even if you manage to stay relevant and up-to-date you'll still get shit from people once you're 40+ as ageism starts to hit you.\n\nWe've been lied to continuously by media, government, and big tech about shortage of talent in tech. They had their agenda to destroy tech salaries and boost their revenues and if you ask me they've achieved it successfully. Sure there is a shortage when someone is offering very low salary and requiring years of experience, but I've yet to witness shortage where adequate compensation is offered.\n\nSo the question is where do we go from here? Do we continue riding this increasingly unstable roller coaster, constantly fighting to stay relevant in an industry that seems designed to burn us out and replace us? Or do we start seriously considering alternatives that offer more stability and respect for experience? I'm genuinely curious what others in this community think, especially those who've been in tech for 10+ years. Are these concerns overblown, or are we witnessing the slow collapse of what was once considered the most promising career path of our generation?",

I've heard many times that it takes 5 years to be proficient, and now that I am nearing that date, I must admit I feel like I've turned a corner, like a few lights have come on, and suddenly I realize I have left burnished calc on many patients that I couldn't feel before and now I realize it's there. I feel like I'm kinda going back on many of my regular patients and cleaning up my own mistakes! I really struggle to feel things with the explorer, but I am just now beginning to be able to adapt it well enough and now am starting to just 'know' where it's likely to be anyway. In the last several months, I've noticed I can just naturally get into deeper areas sub-g and well look at that, I piece that probably I left is there! \n\nJust a couple days ago, I had a very nice patient remark that in the past, she could get go-betweens interprox at 25/26, but over the last year or so (under my care) the area seems to be unable to take a go-between at quicker rates than before. I go into the spot with a freshly sharpened instrument and scrape out like a ton of what appeared to be just smooth, overlapped tooth but was instead calc I had burnished, slowly closing in the gap! \n\nI finally feel like I know how to sharpen my instruments, despite my best efforts to do this often and correctly in the last 5 years. Like, suddenly, I can tell as I'm sharpening if I've got it, like I can hear a change in the sharpening. I now can totally tell the difference of using a nice sharp instrument and a somewhat dull one.  \n\nAt the same time, for the entire last 4.5 years, I would have berated myself harshly and endlessly for missing spots. I would have questioned my ability to even do this job. I would have apologized up and down the patient. But not now, because, at least in my mind, I feel like the only way to have gotten to the spot I'm at now is by practicing so hard for the last 4 years, and that making those mistakes were somewhat unavoidable. So I'm not hating on myself. I'm just taking it like this is probably what a lot of hygienists experience and thus this is why they say it takes 5 years and you just have to go through this stage to get there. \n\nAm I kinda right? Does this sound like I'm not a terrible hygienist for burnishing and leaving things despite my best efforts, and that I will simply move forward, clean up what I've left before, and feel good I've finally hit this level?

      "title": "here is how my DevOps career started and I am happy about it",
      "text": "Hello, I will write down how my DevOps career started. It will be a bit long but I hope it will give encourage to a person.\n\nI have studied mechanical engineering in Turkey (as a Turkish :D) but I was always craving something about software. I was studying away from my hometown and I did not have a computer while studying, so I was borrowing computer of my housemate or going to pc labs in university and I was playing with Python but I was always feeling that I can not code or write algorithms. So idea of doing something in software was always somewhere in my brain...\n\nSo when I was in 2nd semester of 3rd year in university (bachelor degree is 4 years in Turkey) COVID happened and everybody was home. One day I was looking jobs in Poland (during that time period I went to Poland for a semester via Erasmus and I was looking a way to go Poland to live with my girlfriend-mother of my child now) through Glassdoor, oh boy.. every company was looking for DevOps engineers, half of the roles in the entire website was about DevOps. So I was wondering what is that thing.  \n\n\nI found a Youtube video about \"DevOps engineer requirements\" and it was saying \"Python and Linux are enough for a junior DevOps\" (back in time it was enough but probably not now :D). So I said to myself \"I am quite familiar with Python, so let's check that Linux thing\".  \nI had always computer at home since my birth and I was already curious about tech and for a guy like that I have heard Linux million times but I did not check what is that. \n\nSo I started check stuff about Linux, setup a Ubuntu VM in my computer blah blah and... It was miracle for me, I have enjoyed every second of it. Writing something over CLI, seeing how things are done over commands was mind blowing for me, really really really. I said that is definitely something for me.  \n  \nAnd I started dig and read everything I see related about DevOps, I started to play with Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, AWS... That was pure-pure-pure joy for me, building a CI/CD pipeline using many tools and seeing how fast things are over cloud was like a miracle to me. \n\nAll of these things were happening during COVID, my biggest advantage was everybody was at home and I have 24 hours for myself as a university student. So I spent minimum 5 hours every day for 5-6 months. I was always digging and doing something hands-on and writing Medium articles about it and sharing over LinkedIn. After sometime some people noticed me and offered me a Linux Admin role over LinkedIn, I was super happy to have the interview, and I felt very confident because I was about to talk with someone about topics I had studied every day for the past six months.  \nThat was a small company and they have offered something around minimum wage and I have rejected their offer because they were asking to work on-site even though COVID was not fully controlled, plus I was still studying university from home.\n\nSo I felt that I need a bit rest from DevOps stuff and waste sometimes for myself, but I saw my first company's DevOps bootcamp post in LinkedIn and post says they will hire the people that they liked during the camp, so I applied to camp. And they called me 1 week later and we scheduled a meeting.  \nMeeting started and I was feeling super-uber confident, after 15 minutes HR said they are looking to hire me directly, because my CV looks like I don't need their DevOps bootcamp. So they hired me :D, company was offering fully remote role.\n\nI see that post is going to grow, I will start to keep it simple.   \nMy first company was a DevOps consultancy company and they were having many customers. I have worked in that company for 1 year and 3 months. Every day was a challenge, every day a different kind of problem in different customers environment. I was waking up multiple times for alert calls, and handling deployments very early in the mornings + late in the nights. So I can really say that I have gained 5 years of experience in that 1 year and 3 months.  \nSo guess what happened? BAM! BURN OUT!  \nI started to question myself \"Did I choose wrong career path?\", \"Maybe I could stick with mechanical engineering\", \"All of my career and every day of my life will be painful\"\n\nI could not switch my job easily because I was not having work permit in Poland, due to that I could not quit my job in Turkey (by the way I earn in Turkish lira but I live in Poland. And my salary was barely enough to live). I was having many many job offers over LinkedIn but every company was saying \"we can't hire you because we have to grant work permit for you and it takes minimum 6 months, so we can't wait that long\"\n\nAt the end I have found a company that agree to grant me work permit and wait 6 months for that, because of that situation I had to keep my salary expectation really low (if you compare other mid level jobs). So I have worked for that company around 1 year and started to receive many many job offers, they were generally senior position roles. So I have choose the company which pays good and the tech stack I like.\n\nYes, after exactly 2 years and 3 months of experience I have received multiple senior job offers and landed at one of them. Now I work in Polish companies around 3 years, every day is comfortable and very quiet. Nothing left from burn out.\n\nThat was my story, please ignore grammar mistakes and enjoy your path.  \nGood things are not earned easy, give yourself sometime and keep moving on. I know job market is not doing well not but its not your fault, do always something for yourself and worry about the stuff which depends on you, not others.",

I just wanted to share the joy about finally becoming a licensed nurse around here with my fellow nursing students. \n\nThe journey does eventually end and we get to move onto the next stage of our lives. Try to remember this the next time you're at clinicals or can't sleep the night before clinicals, or the next time you're doing some bogus homework assignment/vsim/paper/pre-SIM or post-SIM documentation/group assignment/group presentation/preceptorship presentation/making pharmacology flash cards/studying a stack of flash cards/studying ridiculous mnemonics: it *will* all eventually end in you becoming a nurse. \n\nFor any who are interested in how to study for the NCLEX (or at least how I studied): I've been answering questions on yourbestgrade since February to prepare for all the HESIs I had to take in my last semester. I ended up doing about 1,200 questions from February to June, and I always studied the rationales so that it was like I was studying material from all of nursing. But in the period after my last HESI (May 6) to June 5, I only did about 100 questions on YBG, and that was only in the two days before I took the NCLEX. If you've been studying diligently all along and have practiced how to take tests and read all of the questions and answers, you should be okay. \n\nKeep up your efforts and know that you're doing a tremendous job!

There’s this narrative that everyone breaks six figures after a few years, but based on the folks I’ve met and the discussions in this sub, very few actually hit that number.\n\nAccording to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median salary is around $57k, which honestly feels low, but still gives a better picture than the hype. I made about $70k my first year, but that was doing flatbed, which definitely pays more than van/reefer. Even now, I’m on a dedicated drop-and-hook account at 70¢ per mile running Portland to Boise/Sacramento, and I average roughly $1,500 a week before tax, about $78k a year. I don’t see many positions with earning potential much higher than that, especially not for dedicated work that’s drop-and-hook.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the bigger money is in local work. Being an owner-operator can obviously be big money too. Not complaining, just an observation. There’s a ton of misconceptions and way too much hype about this line of work. That hype is a whole different rabbit hole too. I enjoy what I do for the most part, but yeah… it’s definitely overrated compared to how people talk about it.

I broke down at work after being forced by my boss to carry out procedures for which I've had barely any training - CT scans, sedation, phlebotomy etc. I have a dentist co-worker who belittles me in front of patients any time I miss a TINY bit of calculus. The assistants don't respect me and often leave me working alone for multiple appointments at a time whilst they sit in the staff room chatting.\n\nAfter my breakdown, during which I was sobbing and hyperventilating, my manager told me to take some time off to clear my head and reset. So I requested ONE day off a month in advance -nothing major, right?- but they refused it as I'm fully booked for the next six months and they won't cancel patients. So what do they expect me to do? I got signed off sick for three weeks by my doctor but my bosses guilt tripped me into coming in anyway. A few days later, I handed in my notice, and I'll be done on June 28th.\n\nSince then, my life has consisted of daily panic attacks before work. I've unintentionally lost 25lbs as a result of only being able to force down one small meal a day. I'm only getting two or three hours of sleep before work, and as soon as I wake up and realise I have to go in - a panic attack begins. I've now been put on beta blockers and SSRIs, but it still takes every ounce of energy I can muster to leave my house.\n\nI've worked in dentistry for 12 years (assisting for seven years, an RDH for five), and hygiene has made me HATE the field that I used to adore. This mental breakdown has been a long time coming, because I've been burnt out pretty much since the day I started. This job was nothing like it was made out to be in school.\n\nI'm sick of entitled and rude patients, constantly running late due to things outside of my control, arrogant dentists, pushy receptionists, back/shoulder/wrist/neck/hip pain, the SHEER MONOTONY, and having to be 'on' all day. \n\nThis job is hard enough in and of itself, but having to spend nine hours a day 'performing', slapping on a fake smile, and pretending everything is great all the time for the sake of the patients, has ruined my mental health. This job has been slowly killing me from the inside out. I used to be happy, I used to have a social life, I used to have hobbies that brought me joy. I'm just a shell of my former self now. I genuinely have no energy to do anything other than lay in bed and disassociate when I'm not working.\n\nI used to say that I'm an introvert doing an extrovert's job. I'd hoped that after a few years, I'd get used to it, but after receiving my autism diagnosis recently, I realised that there's no 'getting used to it' for me. I've spent five years masking in order to make everyone else comfortable, and I'm exhausted.\n\nI can't stand dealing with people all day, making pointless small talk, having to molly-coddle full grown adults, and having the treatment I'm going to be carrying out dictated by patients that think they can just pick and choose what they have done like they're at a spa, not a dental office.\n\nThe only upsides of hygiene for me are the pay and part time hours, but that's just not worth it for me any more.\n\nOnce I'm done, I'm taking at least a month out to work on my mental and physical health, then I'm going to find a job in a completely different field. I don't care if it's less pay and involves more hours, as long as it's not related to dentistry -and I don't have to be patient/customer facing- I'll be happy. I just want to sit in front of computer with my resting bitch face and not talk to anyone.\n\nI know the vast majority of hygienists love their career, and I'm really happy for those that do, but I'm not one of them.\n\nI wanted to post this just in case anyone is having similar feelings. There are ways out. If you hate this job, please don't let it ruin your physical and mental health like it has mine. It's not worth it.\n\n\nUpdate: it's June 28th and I'm finally free! Walking out of that place, knowing I'll never have to see any of my asshole former patients or pick up a scaler ever again was the most relieved I think I've ever been in my life. I feel like the world has been lifted off of my shoulders. No regrets. Shall update again after my break!\n\nUpdate 2: it's September 20th and I'm working again! Since the job market in the UK is in tatters at the moment, I had to go back into dentistry. I'm now assisting at an orthodontic office. My best friend also works there, which helps a lot, but it's genuinely the best practice I've ever worked at, and orthodontics is so much easier (to me) than general dental assisting. My mental and physical health has improved greatly. I'm in a good place now. ",

      "text": "I had to put down my cat last tuesday. I had that day off with my BF and we made the decision that it was time. The poor boy was just suffering. Massive dose of barbituates after he was under a general sedative and it was all over. Just peaceful. Poor boy was only 6 but cancer ate him down to the bone. It was one of the worst days of my life.\n\nI called my chef on monday to tell him that i could not come in on tuesday, my day off. Schedules are always subject to change in the industry. Sometimes you just get a shitload of reservations and need more people. I get it. So i called to say that Tuesday, i could not be on call for that reason. He was apologetic of course and said \"you're ok, we got other people. Sorry it came to this. My daughter went through that last year and was broken up about it for months. But are you good for wednesday? because we got a lot of people then and we need your help.\n\nSo i show up wednesday. I was off my game. I was just kind of out of it. Going through the motions, needing more direction as to what i should be doing next than normal. Of course i was, given the day i had yesterday. And then for service, I perform. The exec, who is a good boss but over the hill and just putting in time before he retires to the south, he's laughing it up with the sous who is working cold side. meanwhile me and this other guy - who is the real backbone of the kitchen who makes all the shit happen - are putting up the buffet taco menu we got for that night. He did the steak and beans and marked the tortillas on the grill, while i did the ground beef and chicken and rice. And it was upsetting. We're the two lowest paid guys in the kitchen and we're doing the important part while the highest paid salaried guys did the easy part. and we had 2 other cooks in the kitchen helping them and doing prep for saturday. The backbone guy and I wanted some help. And the foh manager noticed and asked us what was up. And the backbone guy just told her straight up how it was bullshit he gets all this responsibility and none of the pay, and i second it saying \"i don't like how they're running it compared to last year\" when we had a different sous who quit over conditions, and then said \"it's not right and unfair to both of us, but especially to (the backbone guy).\n\nThen it hits me that my cat won't be there to say welcome home and make biscuits against my chest and bicep while i play on my computer and pet him. And i'm also hot as fuck because it was a hot day and i'm in a kitchen, so i go to the freezer and just cry once the buffet is closed because i was at a breaking point. That was the best part of my day, when i came home to him. \n\nThe next day the exec and sous pull me aside and ask what happened and why backbone guy and I had bad attitudes that day. I tell them straight up that the backbone guy and i felt under the gun while you guys and the 2 other cooks were taking it easy on cold side prepping for saturday, and that it was also one of the worst days of my life and that i had to cry in the freezer because of how shitty everything was with me relating to my cat and that i'm sorry i let my personal life affect my work. They understood and things were fine. Backbone guy said to me that i was a better man than him because there was no way he'd be there after something like that. I told him i wouldn't put him in that position because then he'd have been even more in the shit and he's taught me too much for me to do him like that. \n\n  \nAnyway, i wanted to share about the first and only time i've ever had to cry in the walk in because of how shit the day was. Usually i just get mad and go outside and smoke a cig and curse people out in my head. ",

For those of you who are saying the math doesn’t check out it’s \n\n$75hrx8hrs(600 a day x 5 days a week) that’s 3,000. I make 800 on the day I temp ($100/hr) That’s a total of 3800 a week. 3800x52 weeks is 197,000. I take some time off (so more like 48 weeks) so I made around 185k. Also…this is all BEFORE taxes. And when I made 200k I worked at $75/hr for 4 days a week instead of one, still working a total of SIX days a week. I hope this is more clear, sorry for any confusion!

      "text": "I’m an entry-level para at a large firm in CA, and had year of experience in the field at a very small firm before being hired. I make $24/hr and I willingly chose this job, taking a pay cut of $2/hr to gain experience at a bigger office and hopefully have room to grow. I even asked them to match my previous salary and they said no due to “equity” for entry level positions. I took the job anyway. \n\nI know that’s not the worst hourly rate I’ve seen on this sub. I’ve seen the horror stories of $10/hr listings etc. and I can’t imagine what some of y’all go through. That said, given the high cost of living where I am, I was scraping by at $26/hr and now I’m underwater. If not for my partner who makes 2.5x my pay and essentially supports us both, I would be living with parents or homeless. \n\nI love my job so far, I love my firm and my colleagues and the independence I have. But I can’t even buy weekly groceries. My car had issues this week and I had the terrifying realization that if I needed a new car I simply could not take on car payments, much less a down payment even on a beater. \n\nEven while enjoying the job, it’s hard not to get down about this. I have a bachelor’s degree, I’m smart, motivated, and am already consistently surpassing my firm’s goals after 6 months. To be one bad day/breakup away from homelessness given these things is incredibly scary and makes me wonder if it’s really worth it to continue in this field. Sure, there’s opportunity for growth from the bottom, but that bottom is so low.\n\nIs this a normal experience? When will the pay get better? Is it just my firm or does everyone just “eat sh*t” and suck it up the first 5 years? I guess I’m just looking for some clarity here on how normal or abnormal this is. Feel free to tell me I’m whining.\n\nEdit: I feel like I need to add — this is a remote job but based in CA and so of course I live here. That was 90% of what convinced me to switch over. It’s an enormous benefit to me, quite honestly.",

      "title": "I’ve tried most of the dental temping apps! Here are my honest thoughts (Central FL RDH who also picks up DA shifts) and what I wish I knew before going full-time temp",
      "text": "Hi! I’m a dental hygienist in Central Florida who temps full time. Because I’m full time temping, I also pick up dental assistant shifts if it makes sense $$$ wise. I genuinely love temping! It lets me control my schedule and spend more time with my son. Here’s my take on the apps I’ve used the most, plus a few things I wish I knew before making the jump.\n\n**Apps I use and how they’ve been for me:**\n\n1. Cloud Dentistry: The first agency I tried. Easy to use but it glitches sometimes. Free CE is a nice perk. Biggest issue for me has been cancellations, I had a fair number of last-minute cancels from offices. Also if an office requests you and you can’t work, it dings your profile score, which is annoying.\n2. Teero: Quicker pay is great. For me there just weren’t as many shifts and the consistency wasn’t there. I’m not a huge fan of the clock in/out flow and support has been hit or miss. Not awful, just not my favorite.\n3. GoTu: My most-used app honestly. Most amount of shifts, solid pay, and most offices I’ve gone to have been okay to great. I like being able to counter offers and just apply when I want a shift. Customer service has been decent and I like that you still get paid if an office cancels close to the shift. \n4. Kwikly: Not a ton of shifts in my area, but the app works fine. I only used once for a bonus.\n5. Toothio: I only used once, I stopped checking because there weren't any shifts I would pick up.\n\n**What I wish I knew before going full-time temp:**\n\n* Have a floor rate and stick to it. Decide your “won’t go below” number for shifts. Counter respectfully and don’t be afraid to pass. I found myself being super resentful working at offices way below I felt like I'm worth.\n* Confirm basics the day before. Software (Dentrix/Eaglesoft/Open Dental), parking, instruments/ultrasonic availability, x-ray sensors, PPE, who to report to. Almost all of these apps give you a way to talk to the office the day before.\n* Build a “go bag.**”** Loupes, light, masks you like, safety glasses, favorite scaler/prophy angle if allowed, pen, name tag, snacks, water, phone charger. If you're already feeling shy in a new area having to ask for a phone charger is going to make you feel like passing away LOL.\n* Track favorites. After a good shift, save the office as a favorite and write 2–3 quick notes (doctor’s style, op layout, staff names). That list becomes gold.\n* Expect cancellations and protect your income**.** Know each app’s cancellation policy and lean into ones that pay for late cancels. I feel like I won the lottery every time I get paid for a late cancel. \n* Mind taxes and mileage**.** If you’re 1099, set aside a % from every payout and log mileage the same day. Future-you will be grateful. This has been a gamechanger with me. One of the apps I use has a partnership with H&amp;R block and they helped me set-up my LLC.\n* Be versatile. If you're serious about full-time temping and willing to do it take on DA shifts here and there fills gaps and keeps cash flow steady when hygiene slows.\n* Communicate!!! A quick morning text (“I’m Y/N, arriving 7:45, anything special today?”) sets a profesh tone and avoids surprises.\n* Don’t take a bad day personally. Every office has off days. Say thank you, leave a professional impression, and move on. I used to want to go on Google and leave them a review after a bad experience but now I just make a note to not go there anymore.\n\nWhy I love temping:  \nI control my time. I can load up on work when I want to and block days for my son (8YO) without asking anyone for permission. I get to meet different teams, pick up tricks, and avoid getting stuck in a toxic culture. The variety keeps me sharp.\n\nHappy to answer questions about any of these apps or temping in general! Pay, packing lists, handling nerves at new offices, whatever you’re curious about. If you’re on the fence about going full-time temp, I’m cheering you on.

      "title": "Why do cybersecurity experts becomes content creator if the field pays well?",
      "text": "As the title suggests, I'm curious, does CyberSec really pay as well as people claim? I've heard from many that while not everyone, a good number of professionals in the field earn six-figure salaries. But then, others say that people in data science tend to earn even more than cybersecurity engineers. So, which one is actually true?\n\nA few months ago, I started considering a career switch. As an artist, I've had very few opportunities and low pay compared to the amount of work I put in. I have no IT background, but I've seen people break into the field without even having a degree. So, I decided to start studying part-time. Even if I don’t land a job soon, at the very least, I'll be equipped with a valuable skill in today’s world.\n\nNow, coming back to my question, while looking for learning resources, I noticed that so many people in CyberSec are also creating content: making courses, running career guidance websites, teaching online, and producing videos. It made me wonder, if there’s really good money in this field, why are so many professionals investing their time in content creation?\n\nI’ve seen the same thing happen in the art industry, but I understand why artists do it. Our jobs don’t pay well, and there’s zero job security, especially with big studios shutting down left and right. So, content creation became a solid backup for many. But why do CyberSec professionals do it? Is it because they want to escape hectic job schedules? Or is the field not as financially stable as people say?\n\nAlso, I want to ask about the skill gap or lack of skilled talent that everyone talks about, does it still exist?\n\n  \nEDIT: Thanks alot everyone for responding to this post, I am really overwhelmed by the response, these comments really helped me understand this field more now and have cleared many of my misconceptions (although still confused about few) but anyway thanks for this and apologise my ignorance, I have little to no knowledge about this field so all this questions are purely out of curiousity, I don't mean any disrespect towards anyone.",

Everyone at the firm has been there for a long time, and I felt like I had a bunch to prove. \n\nMy performance review went well, but I try to view raises and bonuses as nice but nothing guaranteed. WELL, Friday I open up an email from the managing partner with a letter attached detailing:\n- 1 time “salary adjustment” of $1,000 because they felt my initial salary was low &amp; wanted to comp for the past 6 months. \n- Additional raise of $4,000 a year, starting with my next paycheck \n\nI’m so hyped!! I don’t know if this is standard or not, but I feel very honored to work at such a firm and it definitely puts the pressure on to keep going :) it’s crazy because I did not negotiate or anything.

I wanted to share what the starting pay as a new grad is since I know when I was in school I was always so worried about not making enough as I wanted to make after going through such a hard program. However I have to say I am very happy with my pay as a brand new RT and hope I can motivate those still going through all those unpaid clinical shifts and hard tests. I know it is very region dependent and as I live in socal near LA I’m sure the wages are def on the higher end. One of my hospital jobs pays 47$/hr base pay with a 1$ differential for nights and weekends, so if you worked a Saturday night you would get 49$/hr and the last 4 hours of a 12 hour shit is automatic overtime putting those hours around the 70$/hr range so on average a 12 hour shift pays about 55$/hr. My second job has a base pay of 44$/hr and a 3$ night differential, no weekend differential and no OT unless you work over 36 hours. I’m pretty happy with my pay as a new grad hope this is helpful to some of y’all hope if didn’t come of as bragging lol just wanted to share this info as I know how much you might possibly make can be ambiguous.

      "text": "Okay so for some context: I just finished sophomore year of my 4 year BSN program. Sophomore year was our first year of actual nursing classes after a full year of prerequisites like bio and chem etc. \n\nThroughout this semester, there has been a group of students that is blatantly cheating on just about every exam. We use ATI and they have some way to get around the lockdown browser, and they also keep their phones on them to look up questions. The teachers are very aware of it, but no one is kicking them out of the program. They have literally caught one person in particular with his phone during exams with chat gpt open and he is still around. He was even allowed to keep the grade he got on that test even though he was caught red handed (the program handbook clearly says that that should be a 0 and it gets reported to the office of academic integrity). \n\nI know I’m not the first person to ever complain about classmates cheating, but I feel like this is ridiculous. \n\nAdditionally, I am one of like 8-10 males in my cohort, and the over half of my male peers are involved in this cheating. I think my professors know I am not involved, so I’m not worried about being accused of cheating. However I feel like it just gives all of the male nursing students a bed rep.\n\nI know I should just keep my head down and do my thing. I’m sure these people will wash out eventually, or atleast they will fail their nclex. But it’s still frustrating that I’m working so hard and got top marks, but they can cheat without repercussions. The professors are all aware of it and they know who is cheating. \n\nIf anyone has any advice I’d greatly appreciate it. ",

He didn’t seem to appreciate that question and gave me a non-answer and then asked me again what my range is. \n\nI said between $75,000 to $85,000 because that falls under the market value for this position with someone of my yrs/qualifications. \n\nFor reference (and didn’t tell him this obviously), I am making $68,400.00. I would like to jump to at least 20% so roughly $82,000. But willing to cut down to $79,000 if it comes down to it. I did enough research to know that my expected range is accurate for a paralegal with my experience in my area. \n\nManaging partner didn’t seem to think so and claimed that that’s a high range within their paralegal team. \n\nI asked if that’s in the budget and he seemed offended and said yes but still on the high end. \n\nNot sure how I feel about this. On the one hand, not a complete no. But on the other, if I do receive an offer, I’m worried any raise (requested or annually) wouldn’t be offered in the future.\n\nHave you ever had a situation where someone said your salary range was “high” during an interview?

The problem I am having is when I search for DA jobs in my area that fit my experience, I don't see a lot of jobs that offer salaries better than what I currently make. I do see analyst jobs with better salaries that want a lot of ML or DE experience. If I stay at my current job, the next jobs up the ladder are less technical roles. They are more like management/project management type roles. Who knows when those positions will ever open up. \n\nI feel like the next step might be to specialize in DE but that will require a lot of self learning on my part.

A few specific questions to kick off the discussion:\n\n1.  How long is it taking you to land interviews once you apply? (Are you seeing 1–2% callback rates like juniors, or significantly better?)\n\n2.  Once you get to the interview stage, are companies moving fast or dragging their feet with 6–8 rounds, homework, presentations, etc.?\n\n3.  Salary trends – are you seeing compression at the senior level, or are good roles still paying 2021–2022 money (or even higher)?\n\n4.  Fully remote senior/manager roles: dead, dying, or still out there in decent numbers?\n\n5.  Are layoffs still rippling at the senior level, or is it mostly back to “normal” attrition?\n\n6.  Any noticeable difference between industries (finance/healthcare/gov vs. tech startups vs. MSSPs/consulting)?\n\n7.  Geography – if you’re in the US, are certain regions (TX, FL, NC, CO, etc.) clearly hotter than others right now?\n\n8.  For those who recently switched: what was the deciding factor (money, WLB, remote, title, etc.)?\n\n—\n\nPlease mention (roughly):\n\n•  Your total YOE and current/previous title\n\n•  Main certifications\n\n•  Rough location or “US – fully remote”\n\n•  Whether you’re actively looking or just watching the market\n\nTrying to separate anecdote from trend here – the more experienced voices, the better.

I am a felon in the state of Arkansas and was wondering if anyone knows if this would be a good career choice for me? I have drug charges, some are class A. Would this prevent me from getting jobs in this field? Would this degree be worth pursuing? I am feeling very discouraged lately and like a failure because I feel like I am so so smart and I wasted my potential because I went to prison. Getting a job anywhere has been hard for me due to my record and I heard that computer tech jobs are felon friendly and avg salary in my state is around 60k. Also is getting my degree in computer science better than maybe going to a computer tech bootcamp type of thing? Any recommendations on some tech boot camps if anyone has taken any? Thank you ",

I'm pretty tight with Sydney the charge nurse, maybe I've done something to annoy her recently. well, a bit later I end up having to start a HFNC in room 26, which is coincidentally right outside the residents station. I overhear another nurse walk up to the station and say, \"hey Sydney, room 23 is asking if they can eat, is that okay\" \"yeah that's fine\"\n\nin a panic, I check EPIC for who was putting the orders in for the BiPAP in room 25. Of course, it was a resident named Sydney.\n\nI facepalmed so fucking hard lmfao. Turns out Sydney the charge RN isn't working tonight lol\n\nTLDR: got a call from someone to pull a BiPAP.

The main reason I am this way is because patients give me significant anxiety, which causes me to not really get in there and do what I need to do. For instance, I tried to use the releaf system and immediately my patient was like “I have had dozens of cleanings in my life and they have never needed to use this”. I try to explain the benefits and he said “well I prefer to not have it” in a very aggressive tone. Then I got insecure and never tried it again. I’ve had patients freak out on me when I request they wear safety glasses. I told a patient I noticed her lips were really dry and asked if they had been more so with cold weather and she ripped off her napkin and said “I’m done” and left.  I’ve had great patients too and many that request me, but I’m literally terrified I’m going to trigger them and have them either flip out on me or leave me a terrible review and get me in trouble with my boss. I find myself hand scaling a lot because people get so upset over the water/sound of the cavitron, even when I do everything to control both those factors. I also feel like sometimes I’m not as aggressive as I need to be hand scaling because I don’t want to cause pain and have my patient be upset with me. I really want to do better and be a great hygienist but I get so intimidated by these experiences. Does anyone have any tips on how to be a more confident hygienist and not let myself be so intimidated by patients? I have been on maternity leave and really want to do better when I go back. ",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\n\nI’ve been lurking here for a while, and this subreddit has been incredibly useful, so I wanted to reach out for some sincere advice.\n\nI’m based in the UK and come from a strong technical background—a Master’s in Mechanical Engineering—and worked my way up to a senior level in that field. Through my work, I had exposure to Python for automation and analysis, but I never formally worked in a data-related role. Due to lifestyle reasons and wanting more stability for my young family, I stepped away from that career.\n\nSince then, I’ve been unemployed for a while but have completely immersed myself in Data Engineering. It’s honestly all I’ve been eating and drinking—I’ve fallen in love with it. I’ve been teaching myself from scratch, going deep into SQL (including advanced concepts like window functions, query optimization, and performance tuning), understanding the full ETL process, and reading Fundamentals of Data Engineering by Reis &amp; other software design style books for the correct business speak (to ensure I am conversant in the data language). I’ve also worked on end-to-end projects, taken courses on the Azure tech stack ADF etc and built an understanding of data modeling methodologies (Kimball, Inmon, Medallion Architecture). To make sure I’m covering enterprise-level knowledge, I’ve also learned about CI/CD and how it applies to data pipelines. \n\nAs a personal project, I’ve built and automated my own data pipeline using sports data, which has really boosted my confidence that I can handle the responsibilities of a DE role. I feel like I have a solid grasp of Data Engineering concepts and am eager to put in whatever work is required.\n\nHere’s my dilemma: I’ve been out of work for some time, and with a young family to support, I really need to secure a reasonable salary. A significant pay cut just isn’t possible for me. A friend from a previous workplace, now in a senior position, has offered to be my reference and say I worked as a Data Engineer there. While I have the skills and knowledge to do the job, I understand this is ethically grey.\n\nMy ultimate goal is to land a DE role through interviews based on my actual skills and knowledge. Given my background and the effort I’ve put in, do you think this transition is realistically possible? Has anyone here made a similar switch, and if so, how did you position yourself effectively?\n\nI’d really appreciate sincere advice. If you’re just here to pass judgment, please move along—I truly want this and am looking for guidance from those who have been through similar journeys.\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "Hey guys\n\nI am currently working as a DevOps engineer with a somewhat modern techstack  (Kubernetes, Git, Gitlab, Ansible, AWS, Python, RHEL, Podman etc.) We are responsible for a specific product (which is pretty boring TBH) and I’m there to automate the software development processes.\n\nNow I had the chance to interview for a new position which would bump me up to senior level and would come with a salary increase.\n\nAt first I was pretty convinced of the position but then I started to have doubts. Mainly because the Techstack does not include Kubernetes which I’m pretty bummed about. I would also have to get familiar with specific Microsoft products mainly in the Endpoint Security space.\n\nWhat do you guys think? Is it worth switching for a higher salary and to get a more senior role (where I would also have to mentor some of the junior guys and “market” our team to the business to get more visibility etc.) but would have to deal with the fact that they don’t use Kubernetes and would have to dive deeper into more proprietary tools/software?",

      "text": "The answer is:&gt;!no one!!!!&lt;\n\nBut seriously, we all eventually get tired of being burnt, and sore, and black snot.   Maybe you realized welding doesn't pay as much as advertised.   Maybe you're tired of micro managing bosses. Maybe your 6 hour commute sucks.  Either way CWI and Weld Eng are great escape plans.   What better way to ease into retirement than a desk job.\n\nPay probably overlaps high end welders.  If you weld pipe you'll take pay cut.  [Glassdoor says we make $85-149k.](https://www.glassdoor.com/Salaries/welding-engineer-salary-SRCH_KO0,16.htm)\n\nSo how do you become a WE?   You typically need a BS (4 year degree in welding or something like it).  If you have a AAS you might be halfway done already.   A lot of WE are converted mech engineers or metallurgists, some of them are good, but IMO they have an uphill battle.  The first two years are similar to normal weld training like at a community college.   The last two years are more program mgmt, automated processes, designing, codework, etc.\n\nI'm sure there are other's but here are the main schools offering 4 years of welding-ish training.  In my experience each school is tailored toward their local industries;  The majority of Ferris grads go into automotive.   The Texas guys are hitting oil &amp; gas.

      "title": "Blind Enumeration of gRPC Services",
      "text": "We were testing a black-box service for a client with an interesting software platform. They'd provided an SDK with minimal documentation—just enough to show basic usage, but none of the underlying service definitions. The SDK binary was obfuscated, and the gRPC endpoints it connected to had reflection disabled.\n\nAfter spending too much time piecing together service names from SDK string dumps and network traces, we built [grpc-scan](https://github.com/Adversis/grpc-scan) to automate what we were doing manually: exploiting how gRPC implementations handle invalid requests to enumerate services without any prior knowledge.\n\nUnlike REST APIs where you can throw curl at an endpoint and see what sticks, gRPC operates over HTTP/2 using binary Protocol Buffers. Every request needs:\n\n* The exact service name (case-sensitive)\n* The exact method name (also case-sensitive)\n* Properly serialized protobuf messages\n\nMiss any of these and you get nothing useful. There's no OPTIONS request, typically limited documentation, no guessing `/api/v1/users` might exist. You either have the proto files or you're blind.\n\nMost teams rely on server reflection—a gRPC feature that lets clients query available services. But reflection is usually disabled in production. It’s an information disclosure risk, yet developers rarely provide alternative documentation.\n\nBut gRPC have varying error messages which inadvertently leak service existence through different error codes:\n\n`# Calling` `non-existent\\`\\`unknown service FakeService\\`\\`real service, wrong method\\`\\`unknown method FakeMethod for service UserService\\`\\`real service and method\\`\\`missing authentication token`\n\nThese distinct responses let us map the attack surface. The tool automates this process, testing thousands of potential service/method combinations based on various naming patterns we've observed.\n\nThe enumeration engine does a few things\n\n**1.** Even when reflection is \"disabled,\" servers often still respond to reflection requests with errors that confirm the protocol exists. We use this for fingerprinting.\n\n**2.** For a base word like \"User\", we generate likely services\n\n* `User`\n* `UserService`\n* `Users`\n* `UserAPI`\n* `user.User`\n* `api.v1.User`\n* `com.company.User`\n\nEach pattern tested with common method names: Get, List, Create, Update, Delete, Search, Find, etc.\n\n**3.** Different gRPC implementations return subtly different error codes:\n\n* `UNIMPLEMENTED` vs `NOT_FOUND` for missing services\n* `INVALID_ARGUMENT` vs `INTERNAL` for malformed requests\n* Timing differences between auth checks and method validation\n\n**4.** gRPC's HTTP/2 foundation means we can multiplex hundreds of requests over a single TCP connection. The tool maintains a pool of persistent connections, improving scan speed.\n\nWhat do we commonly see in pentests using RPC?\n\n**Service Sprawl from Migrations**\n\nSDK analysis often reveals parallel service implementations, for example\n\n* `UserService` \\- The original monolith endpoint\n* `AccountManagementService` \\- New microservice, full auth\n* `UserDataService` \\- Read-only split-off, inconsistent auth\n* `UserProfileService` \\- Another team's implementation\n\nThese typically emerge from partial migrations where different teams own different pieces. The older services often bypass newer security controls.\n\n**Method Proliferation and Auth Drift**\n\nReal services accumulate method variants over time, for example\n\n* `GetUser` \\- Original, added auth in v2\n* `GetUserDetails` \\- Different team, no auth check\n* `FetchUserByID` \\- Deprecated but still active\n* `GetUserWithPreferences` \\- Calls GetUser internally, skips auth\n\nSo newer methods that compose older ones sometimes bypass security checks the original methods later acquired.\n\n**Package Namespace Archaeology**\n\nService discovery reveals organizational history\n\n* ‍`com.startup.api.Users` \\- Original service\n* ‍`platform.users.v1.UserAPI` \\- Post-merge standardization attempt\n* ‍`internal.batch.UserBulkService` \\- \"Internal only\" but on same endpoint\n\nEach namespace generation typically has different security assumptions. Internal services exposed on the same port as public APIs are surprisingly common—developers assume network isolation that doesn't exist.\n\n# Limitations\n\n* Services expecting specific protobuf structures still require manual work. We can detect `UserService/CreateUser` exists, but crafting a valid User message requires either the proto definition or guessing or reverse engineering of the SDK's serialization.\n* The current version focuses on unary calls. Bidirectional streaming (common in real-time features) needs different handling.\n\nAvailable at [https://github.com/Adversis/grpc-scan](https://github.com/Adversis/grpc-scan).

      "text": "I’ve been a hygienist for almost a year now, and let me tell you, I hit a new low today that has me completely mortified! You know how it is for us, we're constantly swapping through gloves. Grab something, gloves off; back to the mouth, gloves on; then off again to jot down notes during the DDS exam. \n\nWhile sleep-deprived and running dangerously behind schedule, I started to feel flustered and more rushed. It wasn’t until after the DDS evaluation that I finally started the cleaning, only to realize my next patient was already waiting! \n\nIn a rush, I swung around from the computer to the patient’s side, grabbed the low-speed suction and the cavitron, and pulled her lip back to get started on those lower anteriors.\n\nThen, in a horrific moment that will live with me forever, I gasped \"OH MY GOD!\" as I yanked my hand away...\n\nI HAD NO GLOVES ON!!! I was bare-handed, grabbing her mouth like a caught trout.\n\nI started apologizing up and down and said that I wash my hands constantly and that they're \"clean\". I immediately washed them right there in front of her (because nothing screams professionalism like a frantic hand-washing in the middle of an appointment), cavi-wiped the suction, changed the tip, swapped out the cavitron... By this point I was drowning in the weeds... \n\nTo top it off, my next patient was the angriest I’ve encountered yet, yelling at me about the time and how this impacted her. To be fair, I did pull her back nearly 40 minutes late... but still! More apologizing and self-dread for me.\n\nSo, I have to ask, has anyone ever had a similar glove-less moment? Is this kind of mistake somewhat common, or should I increase my anti-anxiety meds and prepare for a potential lawsuit? \n\n",

      "title": "How much is your pride worth?",
      "text": "Bit of an inflammatory title, but it fits my current situation.\n\nI work at a company that is almost quite literally hell-bent on killing me. I work anywhere from 14 to 16 hours a day almost every day of the week. If I try to only work 8 hours a day or not work weekends, projects go to shit because I'm not able to keep the US, UK, and India teams on the same page after a couple of weeks. It's a very disorganized company where the left hand never knows what the right is doing, teams are uncoordinated, etc. \n\nHonestly, from this perspective, it sucks. However, I lead a team of 7 people tackling a crazy amount of cool projects across the organization. I have built a ton of respect, confidence, and trust from upper management and across teams. At this company, I've touched about everything you can touch when it comes to cloud providers, version control systems, tech stacks in general, etc. To the point from when I interview, it borderline sounds like I'm lying.\n\nBut again, I'm working too much and missing too much of my family's life and my own. Now for the dilemma.\n\nI just got an offer from another company. I originally interviewed for one of their most senior devops positions but lost out to someone else. The recruiter, team, and management wanted to keep me in mind for future openings blah blah we've all heard it before. Maybe I'll hear back from them in a year, ya know? However,  I recently got a call from them that they had a backfill opportunity, and while its not what they wanted to offer me, its a position they had open and want me to join the team. All the promises of advancement and promotion opportunities, etc.. were made on the call. Essentially, it's a less senior title with less senior responsibilities. And that's my issue.\n\nSo I feel that I'm stuck in this weird place. The potential employer sounds like an awesome place to work. They have a robust and well-built devops team, modern app and tech stack, well coordinated teams, and just general good work-life balance. But I wouldn't be leading a team anymore, making the decisions, working with upper management and the team(s) on solutions, etc.. but instead delegated work and given marching orders. \n\nCareer wise and even just general work type(?) I feel like I'm taking a hit to my pride. In my head, it makes absolutely no sense to say no but I'm also jaded about employer promises (literally never seen one follow through) and trust a company about as far as I can throw it. Where I'm at now, I'm *the* guy that solves issues, makes the calls, smooths over issues, and gets projects or things in general moving to where they need to be. And that feels great, but again, it's killing me, practically literally. The bags I have under my eyes are crazy.\n\nSo, I'm asking the community here. How much is your pride worth? Comp in this offer is fine in both salary and bonus, and there's an offer of equity (not a lot but not quite a little), but it's super crazy out of this world. If anyone feels like I'm just being an obtuse ass, call me out on it. That's pretty much what I'm asking for.\n\nEdit: After typing all of this out and re-reading it. I realize I'm being an idiot. So I'm going to accept the job. I'll leave the post up rather than delete it for anyone who wants to call me an idiot. I think I just needed to just put it all out there to get my head on straight.\n\nEdit 2: I want to say thank you for the feedback, both harsh and kind. It's appreciated and good to have that sort of criticism and perspective. I had already settled on accepting the offer, but you all solidified it. So, thank you again.",

      "text": "We finished up a round of interviews about a month ago. Been pondering a few of the things that we saw. \n\n- jeans and t-shirt for an interview. I’m sorry, but show some respect for the position and agency. Even if you’re nearly broke you should be able to find a pair of khakis and a golf shirt at goodwill for a song. \n\n- sucking on candy or sunflower seeds through the interview. Nah, friend… we need to get a feel for how well you can communicate *without* crap in your mouth. (Admittedly, talking around food is a valid job skill for us, but still…)\n\n- not having a clear answer for the simplest questions; the predictable ones, e.g., “What skills or abilities do you bring to this position?”\n\n- when asked for five year goals your answer is “I want to be a cop/firefighter/medic, this seems like an easy way to start.” Nope. No shade for someone who wants to be any of those things, but don’t come in and say you just want this til your real job opens up. (An interview a cycle or two back knew the *start date of the next academy class* and told us they only wanted to dispatch ‘til then.)\n\n- have no questions about the agency at all. We cover a lot in our “about us” spiel, but that should prompt some kind of curiosity or digging deeper. We want that. Inquisitive is a positive job trait. Ask about promotion opportunities, or outside details, or the training path, or benefits, or schedule…\n\n- make some eye contact. Staring down at a table for an entire interview is not inspiring. \n\n- don’t come in to an interview and announce that you can’t work X schedule. This is a 24-7 job and “I can’t work weekends” is a guaranteed decline. \n\n- make a joke! Have some confidence, find something easy to joke about. Local sports teams, weird weather changes, anything to break the ice a little bit. \n\nI get it. This job is kind of in the shadows and learning some of the fine points isn’t easy. I get that people don’t want to think of it as a career. I know some departments *do* use dispatch as a holding pattern for potential officers/FF/etc. \n\nBut… damn. When we interview for 2-3-4 DAYS to fill a couple spots, we know we’re investing 3-5 months in training, and - at least in our agency - you’re coming in to a civil service job with really decent pay and outstanding benefits. We want to get a return on our investment, and make this an attractive place for you to be for 5-10-20+ years!",

There were about 10 employees in the interview room, including the HR rep. There were a few candidates interviewing that day, and the session was about 1 hour. Here are my questions:\n\n1) How common is it that there’s only 1 round of interview in the cybersecurity world ? There was also the initial HR phone screening, but I don’t count that as a “round of interview” since they were just discussing the position and to see if the salary and everything met my expectation before scheduling it. \n\n2) Is it common for an HR rep to be in the interview room the entire time for in-person interviews? \n\n3) How many rounds was your interview, or how many rounds is it typical for your company if you participate in the hiring process?\n\n\nEDIT1: Obviously, I am not complaining at all.

If shit hit the fan, it would hit my desk and I would find a way to fix it or minimize damage, if a file turned into a dumpster fire, i took it from the most senior paralegal. I took over the records department, began handling the liens, became quasi management, took over training new hires (support staff and attorneys alike) and became everyone’s go to. \n\nWell I was moved to salary and I have been working my ass off. This month I have hit 236 hours in billables, i had one day where I ended up working for 24 hours straight and brought in an equal amount of billables. I am the top biller in my firm, including the attorneys. Despite all that I’ve taken on, and the blood, sweat and tears I’ve spilt in an effort to keep this firm up and running, today my managing partner sent out a blast email to all the support staff blasting me because I hadn’t touched one file in 2 months. \n\nI just called my manager and broke down.

So I thought it was all was good. When I was done with the cavitron and put it away to get my hand scalars, she asked if I could grab her some water. So I sat her up and went to the lobby to grab water. When I got back she was bawling. Like with her stomach bawling, I was completely taken off guard and I asked her what was wrong and she said she was so scared of the ‘water thing’ I used and that she couldn’t believe I used it and that she’s been having cleanings for over 40 years and has never had it used on her. \n\n\nI got her tissues and tried to comfort her. She was inconsolable for a while but then she calmed down… I asked her if she wanted to finish the prophy and she said yes, so I did. Once I finished the appointment I flagged her account and noted to never use the cavitron on her again and then told my office manager. \n\n\nI was kinda shocked though? I’ve only been a hygienist for a year and a half so I’ve never seen this before? Why didn’t she say during the MULTIPLE times I asked how she was doing to stop because she didn’t like it?

      "text": "Little bit of a vent here. I’m a 3rd year carpenter with 1.5 years of framing and 1.5 years of formwork. 2 months ago I applied to a custom structure installer (sheds, cabanas, gazebos etc.) with hopes of starting a career here. They were looking for a 3rd set of hands, they were having a hard time knocking out builds in a timely manner with only 2 guys. The owner was having to go on site to help.\n\nThey took me on, listened to all my needs in the interview (living wage, consistent work, room for growth) and ensured they’d be met. Told them I had a kid and that I was hoping to find somewhere long term to grow to continue to provide for him &amp; my family. They interviewed a couple other guys and chose me out of the bunch fully knowing my experience level.\n\nI show up every day, 10 minutes early and help the other installer clean out the truck from the day before and load it up. I always haul as much as I can possibly handle and push my limits to exceed expectations.\n\nI’m 2 months in and we’re already at a point where we’re capable of doing installs without the install supervisor (just 2 guys), something they were struggling to do in the first place. The 2 guys I work with (install super, other installer) regularly compliment my work/work ethic and give me pointers on how to improve and what the customer wants to see.\n\nWe had a good week, we’re ahead of schedule and we’re booked all the way into November. Friday (yesterday), they unexpectedly put me on a delivery with one of the guys at the shop while the other installer &amp; install supervisor finish off Fridays project. A little unusual but nothing indicating what’s to come. \n\nFriday, 4:00pm, 3 hours after I’ve gotten home I receive a call from the owner: “it’s not going to work out. You should’ve been more up front with me about your experience level. 28$/hour is too much money. I was hoping to find someone with more experience.” My resume was right in front of you during the interview…\n\nI asked if there was anything I could do, even take a pay cut because I absolutely love this job and everyone I work with has been amazing to me. He said no. He’d try and find me a spot in the shop but most likely no.\n\nWhat the hell? I’m with you for 2 months, you regularly tell me “good job today!” and never has he said anything that would’ve led me to believe I was under qualified or ‘not cut out’. They hired me to be a 3rd set of hands, that’s exactly what I made sure I was. What experience do you expect out of a 3rd year apprentice who’s 23 years old? The other installer is going on paternity leave in about a month. This just makes absolutely no sense to me.\n\n\nAnyone have any advice? Does this seem right to you? Or did I just get unfortunately f-cked? There’s no detail I’m leaving out, I’ve never made any catastrophic mistakes or incompetent decisions. I cannot figure out for the life of me why this would happen and why suddenly 2 months later I’m not experienced enough when everything was fine leading up to this point.\n",

      "text": "\nLet’s talk about something no one says out loud:\nOur licenses are technically safe… but quietly being devalued.\n\nHere’s how the implicit downgrade works: \n\n1️⃣ Your RDH License Still Exists… On Paper\n*You went to school, passed boards, and earned licensure.\n* Legally, you are recognized as a healthcare provider.\n* But in practice, your scope is boxed in under dentist control, making your license functionally less independent.\n\n2️⃣ Lower-Standard Alternatives Quietly Move In\n* Foreign-trained dentists, dental therapists, or on-the-job-trained “hygiene assistants” are introduced to fill the same roles.\n* They don’t meet the same education or board requirements as you.\n* Yet, they perform “hygiene” tasks in the public eye.\n* Patients can’t tell the difference, and that’s the point.\n\n3️⃣ The Profession Is Financially Undermined\n* Offices claim “Hygiene doesn’t even cover overhead” to justify:\n    * Flat or reduced wages\n    * Packing schedules back-to-back\n    * Hiring cheaper substitutes\n* The ADA implicitly frames hygiene as replaceable labor, not a specialized profession.\n\n4️⃣ The Public Perception Shift\n* Over time, if anyone can “do a cleaning,” the value of your license erodes.\n* It becomes harder to justify:\n    * Independent practice\n    * Competitive pay\n    * Policy respect\n* Eventually, the pipeline of fully trained hygienists shrinks, because why invest in a career that’s treated like an accessory?\n\n⚠️ Why This Matters\nThis is how professions are weakened without a single law change:\n1. Keep the license “alive” to avoid lawsuits.\n2. Slowly replace or dilute the workforce with cheaper, less-trained alternatives.\n3. Frame it as “innovation” or “access to care.”\n\n\nBy the time the public realizes the difference in care quality…\nIt’s too late.\n\nThis isn’t fearmongering, it’s what we see across the country. If we want our license to mean something in 10 years, we have to:\n* Educate patients on who we are and what we do\n* Advocate for a policy that respects the RDH license\n* Support each other instead of silently accepting erosion\nWe earned these credentials.\nWe deserve better than an implicit downgrade.",

      "text": "Hey everyone,\nI’m a data engineer with about 1 year of experience working in a 7 persons' BI team, and I’m the only data engineer there.\n\nRecently I realized I’ve been working extra hours for free. I deployed a local Git server, maintain and own the DB instance that hosts our DWH, re-implemented and redesigned Python dashboards because the old implementation was slow and useless, deployed some infrastructure for data engineering workloads, developed cli frameworks to cut-off manual work and code redundancy, and harmonized inconsistent sources to produce accurate insights (they used to just dump Excel files and DB tables into SSIS, which generated wrong numbers) all locally.\n\nLast Thursday, we got a request with a deadline on Sunday, even though Friday and Saturday are our weekend (I’m in Egypt, and my team is currently working from home to deliver it, for free).\n\nAt first, I didn’t mind because I wanted to deliver and learn, but now I’m getting frustrated. I barely have time to rest, let alone learn new things that could actually help me grow (technically or financially).\n\nUnpaid overtime is normalized here, and changing companies locally won’t fix that. So I’ve started thinking about moving to Europe, but I’m not sure I’m ready for such a competitive market since everything we do is on-prem and I’ve never touched cloud platforms.\n\nAnother issue: I feel like the only technical person in the office. When I talk about software design, abstraction, or maintainability, nobody really gets it. They just think I’m “going fancy,” which leaves me on-call. \n\nOne time, I recommended loading all our sources into a 3rd normal form schema as a single source of truth, because the same piece of information was scattered across multiple systems and needed tracking, enforcement, and auditing before hitting our Kimball DWH. They looked at me like I was a nerd trying to create extra work.\n\nI’m honestly feeling trapped.\nShould I keep grinding, or start planning my exit to a better environment (like Europe or remote)?\nAny advice from people who’ve been through this?\n\n\nEdit:\nThe management decided to compensate us with additional annual leave, and I found out that our senior engineer has been negotiating with management for a salary raise for the entire department after these rough days. I think there’s something I’m missing.",

      "title": "Through the Lens of COVID: A Radiologic Technologist’s Story",
      "text": "I’ve been an X-Ray and CT Technologist for almost ten years, and I’ve always taken pride in my work. But nothing could have prepared me—or any of us—for what the COVID-19 pandemic brought. It wasn’t just the virus itself; it was the way it exposed the cracks in our healthcare system, the way it pushed us all to our limits, and the way it changed how we saw our work, our patients, and each other. I want to share some of my story, not just as a technologist, but as someone who stood alongside my colleagues in the trenches, trying to keep up with an endless wave of patients (both COVID and non-COVID) who needed us more than ever.\n\n**The Early Days: Fear and Uncertainty**\n\nWhen COVID first hit, everything changed overnight. The hospital felt like a war zone. Patients were pouring in, and we were scrambling to keep up. I remember the first time I scanned a COVID patient—my hands were shaking as I adjusted the machine, trying to focus on the image while my mind raced with questions. What if I got sick? What if I brought it home to my family? But there was no time to dwell on those fears. The patients needed us, and we had to be there for them.\n\nThe images I saw during those early months still haunt me. Lungs that should have been clear and healthy were filled with the telltale “ground-glass opacities” of COVID pneumonia. It was unique, it was unusual, and it attacked everywhere in the body. It was devastating to see how quickly the virus could take hold, especially in patients who seemed healthy just days before. And the hardest part was knowing that many of them were alone, isolated from their families, relying on us not just for medical care, but for comfort and reassurance.\n\n**The Struggle to Keep Up**\n\nAs the pandemic dragged on, the sheer volume of patients became overwhelming. It wasn’t just COVID cases—it was everything. People who had put off routine care during the early months of the pandemic were now coming in with advanced illnesses. Heart attacks, strokes, cancers that had gone undetected for too long. The waiting rooms were packed, the schedules were overbooked, and we were all running on fumes.\n\nI’ll never forget the look on my colleagues’ faces as we tried to keep up. Nurses, doctors, fellow technologists—we were all exhausted, physically and emotionally. I saw people breaking down in the break room, crying from the stress of it all. I saw coworkers working double shifts, skipping meals, and sacrificing their own health to be there for their patients. And I saw some of the best, most dedicated professionals I’ve ever known leave the field altogether because they just couldn’t take it anymore. Losing them was like losing a piece of our team’s soul. These people were irreplaceable, their wisdom, their dedication… we needed them, and the system failed them. The communities are worse off without them. \n\n**The Human Side of It All**\n\nWhat sticks with me the most, though, are the people—the patients and the families. I remember one elderly man who came in for a CT scan. He was so scared, and all he wanted was to hold his wife’s hand. But she wasn’t allowed in the room because of visitor restrictions. So I held his hand instead, trying to reassure him as I positioned him for the scan. He thanked me afterward, and I had to fight back tears because I knew it wasn’t enough. It wasn’t the same as having his family there. How could it? And many fellow professionals were too busy and exhausted to provide the level of comfort these people needed.. we were stretched way further than the usual. \n\nAnd then there were the families themselves, waiting anxiously for news. I’d see them in the hallways, their faces masked but their fear unmistakable. Sometimes, I’d overhear them talking to doctors, trying to understand what was happening to their loved ones. Other times, I’d see them saying goodbye over video calls, unable to be there in person. Those moments broke my heart in a way I can’t even put into words.\n\n**A System Under Strain**\n\nThe pandemic didn’t just test us as individuals—it tested the entire healthcare system. And in so many ways, the system failed. We didn’t have enough staff, enough equipment, or enough time to give every patient the care they deserved. I saw people waiting hours, even days, for scans that should have been done immediately. I saw patients with treatable conditions getting worse because they couldn’t access care in time. And I saw my colleagues—good, caring people—burn out and walk away because they couldn’t keep fighting a system that felt like it was working against them.\n\nIt’s hard not to feel angry about it. We’re supposed to be a safety net, a place where people can turn when they’re sick or scared. But the pandemic showed just how fragile that net really is. And now, as we try to pick up the pieces, I worry about what happens next. Will we learn from this? Will we invest in our healthcare system, in our workers, in our patients? Or will we go back to the way things were, pretending everything’s fine until the next crisis hits?\n\n**A Call for Change**\n\nI don’t have all the answers, but I know this: we can’t keep going like this. We need more support for healthcare workers—better pay, better staffing, better mental health resources. We need to prioritize access to care for everyone, not just those who can afford it. And we need to remember the lessons of this pandemic, not just the pain and the loss, but the resilience and the humanity that got us through it. Patient volumes have only gotten worse since COVID pandemic, and data trends suggest we will continue to exponentially increase in people needing care, peaking in 2040.  \n\nTo my fellow healthcare workers: thank you. Thank you for showing up, even when it felt impossible. Thank you for caring, even when it hurt. And to everyone else: please don’t forget what we’ve been through. Advocate for change. Support your local hospitals and clinics. And remember that behind every mask, every scan, every diagnosis, there’s a person—a patient, a family, a healthcare worker—just trying to make it through.\n\nThis is my story, but it’s also the story of so many others. I share it not for sympathy, but in the hope that it will inspire action. Because if we don’t learn from this, if we don’t do better, then what was it all for?\n",

I study for an hour maybe the day of day before and just do my PrepU questions. First exam I got a 75% and that was with little to no studying and it was because it was about the history of nursing.

And they ask how I did so well and I really don’t have an answer. Any one else working in the medical field think it makes/ made school easier?\nI’m just kinda nervous because what if they are being to easy on us - (I guess not easy because even someone of my strongest classmates  don’t excel on all exams) but I just hope Fundamentals is not just easier class and the next semester’s difficultly level increases so much that I would fail because I didn’t spend the 1st semester honing in on study skills/habits. \nI just feel like a have in impostor syndrome because I just read/heard so much stuff about how nursing school is so hard and that people spend all their time studying.

Exposure to sunlight, fresh air, and steady physical activity satisfies biological needs that are difficult to meet unless your profession involves getting those things.\n\nAdditionally, the shortage of people in the trades and getting into the trades in general really sets you apart as a young millenial / gen Z.

For a while it was great, they were one of the rare companies to offer a salary (40 hours a week) to be paid for indirect and direct treatment sessions. The company is owned by a larger rehab company. The larger rehab company no longer wants to pay us for indirect work. Basically we would only be paid 30 hours a week. Only choice is to go back to 1099. I hated 1099, the pay was never consistent and i needed health insurance. \n\nI know i am beating a dead horse, but I hate that in order to make a wage that is somewhat doable in the OT field, especially for long island, you have to work yourself to the bone. I already have back to back sessions each day, work with some of the lowest functioning students in the school, and bring home so much work to do for notes, evals, reports, emails, prep for sessions. I am lucky if I get to use the bathroom during the day.\n\nI feel like this is the same for most settings in this field. I just can’t do it anymore. I want the security of a salary regardless of how you work every minute of your day. I’m so tired each day and it’s still not enough. \n\nAnd no one truly cares. Not insurance, not these companies. They need to make money and don’t care that actual humans are on the other end of it trying to do all they can.\n\nWith that said, I have no idea what to do. I need to look elsewhere, but i’m a terrified. All i’ve done since graduating is school based ot. But i want out of the field.  I need a change in life. I don’t know where to begin.

      "text": "Way back in 2020, I thought I could be slick and get away with smoking with my friends off the clock of my cushy local job. Never before or at work and only at home as my way to relax and unwind after a long day. I didn't drink or do anything else so in my mind I figured as long as long as I never got hurt or hurt somebody or got in an accident I would be fine. Wishful thinking of a young idiot, I know. When it came time that I needed to find new employment, due to no longer being able to tolerate my management and some of my co-workers, I promptly quit smoking for a good 2 months, took OTC drug tests until they came back clean, and started putting in applications. I thought I was good to go. Little did I know, however, thay the tests you take from DOT are a lot more sensitive than the ones you can buy at a store. They popped me with 0.18 micrograms of THC still left in my system after 10 weeks of being clean. I later found that the tests I was buying for myself only showed positive down to 0.5 micrograms, whereas the DOT tests can detect down to 0.15, and I'd screwed myself. I'd already quit my other job, not that they'd take me back, and now I've not only lost my CDL but the new job I was depending on making a smooth transition into as well. Needless to say it was a very rough self-inflicted period of my life.\n\nI had to pay over $1,000 for a SAP (Substance Abuse Professional) and take about 15 hours of classes to reinstate my CDL, followed by almost 3 years of regular drug testing that I also had to pay for while being observed by the doctor for every single one of them. I also became borderline unhirable despite over half a decade of experience, despite having a squeaky clean record aside from this drug violation. The only jobs I could get have been OTR jobs with small companies that've run me to death because they know I can't go just anywhere. Forced dispatch on some of the worst loads you could ever imagine. Paying me far less than what I'm worth at my experience level. Pressuring me to run past my clocks or use multiple log books when I don't want to (I've stood my ground on this twice before and have lost jobs because of it). Just truly terrible awful awful management. The company I'm with now has been a godsend compared to the guys I drove for in my first 3 years after the violation. They treat me well and i feel respected enough, but still, I hate being OTR and it's been miserable knowing I live in a city where local work is abundant that pays equal or more than my salary but no company would touch me with a 10ft pole, and rightly so. It's been rough, and it's entirely on me.\n\n\nWell, as of today, those 5 years of hell come to an end. My record finally stands clean and I'm free to start applying to jobs that keep me home and come off the road for good, and I couldn't be happier. \n\nI wanted to share this story as a cautionary tale for those career drivers that try to skirt the system. That think they won't get caught. Believe me, my friend, it will catch up to you and you will pay for it. FMCSA and the insurance companies take these drug violations extremely seriously and if you want to be in this industry then I'm sorry but you HAVE to stay clean. If you can't do that, then you're probably better off in some other field. \n\nI've already put in 10+ applications for local jobs in my area and I really can't put into words just how relieved I feel to be getting out of this truck soon. Thank you all for letting me share my story and my excitement with you as I put my past and stupid mistakes behind me and look forward to a brighter future for myself and my family. ",

So many people I know are struggling and applying for hundreds of jobs with no responses etc. This got me thinking.

Now obviously we also need to adapt to this but it's slightly less applicable to us currently. I am an exec chef and use Ai to help with recipe layouts. Food costs, stock take etc. But generally speaking I could do my job without it and no one would notice or expect differently. I feel like in a lot of other jobs they are expected now to use Ai and to be pioneering their fields using such technology. \nSo back to my original point. Are we lucky right now to be chefs in this climate? We are a high demand and now with recent changes a fairly well paid job. Certainly not a top bracket but we get paid a salary to be proud of (certainly in my country UK).\n\nAnyway I'd love to hear your thoughts on whether you count yourself lucky to be a chef right now. \n\nAs I certainly am very grateful that I can guarantee myself a decent wage and have no fears of ever being jobless ",

      "text": "I know this has likely been asked before but it's been on my mind a lot lately as the year comes to a close.\n\nA little background, used to work in various administrative positions, about seven years back I was deeply unhappy and quit. I took big a pay cut to work with some friends doing home remodeling, I was basically the gofer, sweeping floors etc.\n\nA few years ago said friends and myself left the company we were working for to go out on our own. At first I loved the flexibility/freedom and didn't care what we made money wise. But now going into our fourth year I'm finding myself at a critical juncture and trying to decide where to go from here.\n\nMy two partners at the company have very low financial needs and don't want to work a lot. For the past few years we've worked on average 30 hour weeks and made about $25-35k each per year (in a medium to low cost of living Midwestern city). I find myself constantly needing to supplement our schedule with additional work to make ends meet. Juggling my own \"side job\" schedule and the commitments of the company is incredibly stressful and I still struggle immensely financially.\n \nMy partners insist that to make roughly $60k a year (the minimum salary I've stated I desire) we would have to work 60-70 hour weeks year around with no time off and try to subcontract extensively. But I'm just not entirely sure I believe this to be true. I think that we work too many short days, and don't quote high enough. Part of me is convinced that on my own, and with advertising (something we currently don't do and only really work off word of mouth) I could stay booked year around and easily make $60k a year doing paint and drywall alone. I have no interest in being a general contractor or taking a \"manager\" role as that just sounds joyless and counterintuitive to everything I love about this career.\n\nSo basically I'm asking is it possible to work a reasonable schedule and make a decent living or is that a pipe dream? Should I give up my flexible lifestyle and go back to doing this work for someone else to have a more solid and reliable income? \n\nSincerely,\n\nA Stressed Out Carpenter",

      "text": "I graduated from my respiratory program in April 2024, and I’ve been working as an RRT at a Level 1 trauma center for exactly a year and half.  During my program, I realized I wanted to pursue physician assistant school.  I applied this cycle, and was fortunate enough to gain an acceptance on my first try. I start my program in January and as excited as I am, I have to admit I feel a little guilty about leaving after a year and a half.  \n\nThis was my only job as an RRT, my experience has been incredible, I became cross trained in the ED, PICU/NICU, and CVICU, and despite the pay and constant staffing shortages, I actually like my coworkers and the facility.  I think clinicals opened my eyes and made me realize respiratory therapists don’t have as much mobility as nursing and I wasn’t sure if I could see myself doing the same thing for the rest of my career.  I also live in a very HCOL area and realized most of my peers have to work 60 hours a week to support themselves. My starting salary as a new grad was $25/hr and they recently bumped us up to $29/hr. My thought is I’d rather go back to school for 2 years if it means improved career satisfaction and quality of life.\n\nI’ve built good relationships with my coworkers and some lament that they always lose good therapists after a short period of time, and I think that attributes to some of my guilt.

      "text": "\n*Edit* Thank you all for your advice! Please keep it coming! I would like to say that nursing isn’t a career I see myself doing. Major respect but the RN track is not for me. I’m also considering radiology/sonography but would like to go more bedside. Thanks all!\n\nI’m a 19 y/o sophomore on track to earn my bachelor’s in respiratory therapy. I’ve completed most of the prereqs but still have enough wiggle room to change my major if I really want to. Originally, I picked respiratory therapy because I enjoy clinical jobs. I’m a part-time phlebotomist and really like the atmosphere.\n\nMy original plan was to work as an RT for a few years after graduating and then apply to PA school. But now I’m having second thoughts. PA school would mean a lot of extra time and money on my part, and honestly, I’m so ready to graduate that I’m not sure I want to go back for grad school. I’d also have to take a ton of really hard classes, like organic chemistry and biochemistry, on top of my RT curriculum just to meet the PA school prerequisites.\n\nMy question for existing RTs out there is: Are you content with your job, and do you think I should still pursue higher education like PA school? I’ve heard so many conflicting opinions, I’m not sure what to believe. Some people say getting a bachelor’s is a waste of time because they do the same job as RTs with associate degrees. Others say it’s worth it because a bachelor’s is the only way to move into managerial positions.\n\nI shadowed an RT supervisor at a well-known hospital, and he genuinely seemed to love his job. Based on my experience that day, it seemed like something I’d really enjoy.\n\nI’ve also heard a lot of conflicting things about pay. I’m a Type One diabetic, so having a decent salary and great insurance is essential to me. I’ve seen RT salaries ranging from $20–$70 an hour. Making a ton of money isn’t my top priority—I don’t envision myself with kids or a big house—but I’d like to be comfortable.\n\nThanks to anyone who stuck with me through my rambling, I appreciate your insight!",

My team seems to want to eventually make my role completely non-technical (I'm not sure what a non-technical role would entail). The reason is because there's a feeling all the technical aspects will be completely eliminated by AI. The rationale, in theory, makes sense - we focus on the human aspects of our work, which is to develop solutions that can clearly be transferred to a fully technical team or AI to do the job for us. \n\nThe reality in my experience is that this makes a strong assumptions data processes have the capacity to fit cleanly and neatly into something like a written prompt that can easily be given to somebody or AI with no 'context' to develop. I don't feel like in my work, our processes are there yet....like at all. Some things, maybe, but most things no. I also feel I'm navigating a lot of ever evolving priorities, stakeholder needs, conflicting advice (do this, no revert this, do this, rinse, repeat). This is making my job honestly frustrating and burning me out FAST. I'm working 12 hour days, sometimes up to 3 AM. My technical skills are deteriorating and I feel like my mind is becoming into a fried egg. Don't have time or energy to do anything to upskill.\n\nOn one hand, I'm not sure if management has a point - if I let go of the 'technical' parts that I like b/c of AI and instead just focus on more of the 'other stuff', would I have more growth, opportunity and salary increase in my career? Or is it better off to have a balance between those skills and the technical aspects? In an ideal world, I want to be able to have a good compromise between subject matter and technical skills and have a job where I get to do a bit of both. I'm not sure if the narrative I'm hearing is one of hype or reality. Would be interested in hearing thoughts. ",

They offered to give me buyers, but the split was 50/50, and then I’d split my 50% with Keller Williams, which would take another 36% of my cut initially. I said no.\n\nNow, they approached me again and are pleading with me to come back, because they’re moving from Philly to Florida in June and want to split all of their clients between me and another agent on the team. The terms are better now, with it being 50/50 for their leads and 70/30 for me own clients I bring in. They’re switching brokerages so now I’ll only have to pay $500 per transaction from my cut as far as I understand.\n\nI did the math, and they did 60 deals and $550-600k in commission the last year. If business doesn’t slow down, my cut would be around $100-125k (not counting anyone I bring in).\n\nAm I stupid for turning this down? I am 26 years old and I’m flattered that they’re turning down the other candidates and trying to get me, but I know for a fact that I don’t want to be a full-time realtor until I retire. I absolutely hate the on-call lifestyle. Had to spend Easter Sunday doing last minute showings, and they decided not to buy, which was not great lol. I’m good with people and have always been good at the job, but I want to pursue another career, which would definitely take an initial pay cut (the starting salary would be $50,000). My biggest concern is that I take the deal for the money and then lose the years of building up another career.\n\nDo you think it would be better to take the money for now and see how it goes or turn them down?

      "text": "Hi fellow carpenters,\n\nI’ve been working as a carpenter for about 5 years now, and I was recently offered the option to switch to a salaried position. I wanted to get some input from others in the trade — is it normal for carpenters to be put on salary, or is hourly more common?\n\nTo give some context, I don’t usually work overtime at the company I’m with, and if I do, it’s only a few extra hours here and there. And i don’t really discuss wages with coworkers at the company.\n\nAlso, what are the pros and cons of being on salary in the carpentry field? I’m weighing the decision and would love to hear your thoughts and experiences.\n\nThanks in advance!\n\nEdit: I’ve been with the same company for my entire 5-year career, and the company has around 40 employees. It doesn’t seem like they’re out to take advantage of me, but I’m still trying to figure things out since someone new bought the company a few months ago.",

      "text": "I recently received a job offer from a mid-to-large tech company in the gig economy space. The role comes with a competitive salary, offering a 15-20k increase over my current compensation. While the pay bump is nice, the job itself will be challenging as it focuses on logistics and pricing. However, I do have experience in pricing and have demonstrated my ability to handle optimization work. This role would also provide greater exposure to areas like causal inference, optimization, and real-time analytics, which are areas I’d like to grow in.\n\nThat said, I’m concerned about my career trajectory. I’ve moved around frequently in the past—for example, I spent 1.5 years at a big bank in my first role but left due to a toxic team. While I’m currently happy and comfortable in my role, I haven’t been here for a full year yet.\n\nMy current total compensation is $102k. While the work-life balance is great, my team is lacking in technical skills, and I’ve essentially been responsible for upskilling the entire practice. Another area of concern is that technically we are not able to keep up with bigger companies and the work is highly regulated so innovation isnt as easy.\n\nGiven the frequency move what would you do in my shoes? Take it and try to improve career opportunities for big tech?",

A few voiced how the OG hygienists had to work to earn as much as the minimum is now versus nowadays where hourly is high and only getting higher without “earning it” Or they talk about getting too low of payment from insurance to pay that much to hygienists. \n\n\nWhy wouldn’t dentists that value their hygiene pay just as much and not complain that they have to pay more. I feel like if that’s the case OG hygienists should fight for the hourly just as much because they are gold for patient retention in offices.\n\nBut some offices charge out $50 fluoride treatments, desensitizers, laser therapy, oral cancer screenings - then there’s talking about toothpastes, floss, mouth rinses, I can go on and on about it. On Velscope there was an office that implemented it and the DDS doesn’t even take time to look in the velscope then why should I advocate it if they don’t put the time to check it also for $30+ out of pocket for patient?\n\nWe generate a lot of income for dental offices, why is this still an issue with dentists and paying hygienists! \n\nDefinitely know in every state pay is different with our profession but still surprised as to this comment. \n\nAll I was able to say to it previously was that as long as someone puts effort into what they do and show they’re worth that hourly it doesn’t matter if you’re a “new grad”\nor “seasoned hygienist”; and to pay it if you want to keep someone that’s good and turnover rate goes down also. Why does salary always have to be hush hush in offices like that where they complain to pay higher and still keep their loyal hygienist low. \n\nWant to hear any and all the opinions on this ",

I would still count those 2 hour breaks as part of my working hours because I am still going to be at the restaurant. Also something could go wrong and my staff would need me to be on-site. So even during breaks I'm technically still working and on-call.\n\nAnd of course, he said I will have to cover shifts if someone doesn't show up. So sometimes I will work 6 days a week. Obviously I would have to cover for every and any shifts - server, host, cooks, sushi chefs, etc.\n\nWhen I calculate $70K a year for 62 hours a week, it only comes out to be $22 per hour.\n\nIs this worth it?

      "text": "I got my license right out of high school and have been at the same brokerage since. It split from KW around that time and became independent. I started on a 50/50 split for my first 10 deals, then moved off that after my first year.\n\nBack then, training was great—one of the owners was a killer salesperson and led most of it. But after a falling out, he was bought out about 3 years ago, and training quality tanked. We absorbed another brokerage, but the brokers we got in return don’t do any personal business and basically coast on salary. One of them is also our “productivity coach,” but honestly, he's terrible.\n\nThe current owner is solid—closes 50–80 deals a year and makes time for us—but his style isn’t replicable, so the training isn’t that useful. Recently, one of our top producers tried to help by running office-wide training since morale was low. But when they tried to figure out how to pay him, the brokerage lowballed him to keep paying the existing coach. They ended up copying his methods anyway, but the quality dropped.\n\nThe comp structure also changed:\n\n* **Old (Partner Plan)**: 70/30 split, $24K cap, Realtorcom leads, paid sign installs, E&amp;O, listing photos, RedX, CoStar (just me, since I cold call), TC, and training (though it was already getting weak).\n* **Now**: 80/20 split, $25K cap, no leads, no sign installs, no listing photos. Still includes E&amp;O, TC, RedX, CoStar, training (still bad), plus free printing and paper for flyers/mailers.\n\nAt the end of the day, I know I’m the one who has to make the calls, but the energy in the office sucks. I’m 22 and usually in the top 10 agents, only doing around $6M a year, but most people do their own thing. That gets tiring, especially when you're the only one door knocking or cold calling. I also feel like I shouldn't be top 10 in the brokerage with the volume Im doing I feel like we don't have enough high producers and the ones that are high producers our opinions arent valued when we share them and I feel like if there was more comradery and more top producers the brokerage wouldn't be changing up the training all the time cause we would know what works. VS rn the brokerage we absorbed was failing and now it feels like we're getting bullshit training.\n\nThis was the only brokerage I interviewed with, and at the time it felt like the right fit. But with everything that’s changed, I’m not so sure anymore. I guess I just needed to vent—but I’m also wondering if I’m being realistic or falling into “grass is greener” thinking.\n\n  \nAlso the shitty part about leaving is I have a CRM full of around 1k leads that I generated myself through door knkcing and cold calling. I have a few listings and buyers with signed contracts and all of those would stay with the brokerage. So yeah...\n\n  \nWhat would you do if you were me? I'm in UT if that helps. ",

Basically, my formal education was in X-ray, but all of my work experience is MRI.\n\nI am wondering if there are other MRI Techs who had a similar path, cross training into MRI without formal education. I had to do the structured education credits the ARRT requires for obtaining MRI licensure. I am just concerned not having formal education in MRI could be a roadblock to obtaining CAMRT licensure. I am still submitting my application and seeing what happens, but curious to know how this has worked for others in my situation.",

Pre trip inspection? Free. Literally not driving? Free. It's a scam. It's basically the equivalent to being salary except way more unpredictable. You laugh at your boss when they ask you to be salary but you'll happily accept CPM. If they made truckers hourly we'd have much more income especially with on duty time. Because we can work up to 14 hours a day. It's fucked up how we're treated and we deserve better. They keep us at CPM because they don't want to pay us OT. they're literally taking advantage of us and you scoff and laugh at people who think otherwise.

I feel like I have a responsibility to put this out somewhere so that nobody makes the mistake I do and works for them if they don't have to.\n\nManagement doesn't care about you unless they know you outside of work. That or you are entertaining in the office and they find you amusing. Hard work isn't recognized. Talking with the field guys they say there is like a dark cloud that encompasses the office and yard of Barnhart. Pretty much every branch is like this from my research \n\nThere is a mean girl type of click I'll call it the good ole boys because this is a group of all little boys. I played what I thought was a good team player role, a very vital role that at the time felt important. But now that I think about it they were just using me. They use hourly employee like mules and there is no clear path of moving up. If you are going into a role pretty much anywhere at Barnhart make sure you negotiate your wage and time off then because there is no room for advancement. You are stuck. You will be sold an idea that you will make more with more responsibility. That is not the case. Good workers that are good as gold in my eyes are looked down on and talked about. Never paid any more money. People that actually care about the company and work hard, there are no incentives.\n\n Being an amazing a guy that comes in early and leaves late does not have value. I worked so hard here some days my body was physically sore all weekend into the next week. But if you are not Union Hourly or if you don't have a good salary I really don't know why you would work there. Salary guys work 50 hours a week and never really get any lower hours. They get 2 weeks PTO maximum, and usually have responsibilities that have them needing to answer the phone while taking said PTO. \n\n Union guys talk a lot about leaving and going somewhere better. Non union hourly guys are the bottom of the barrel. I've witnessed fights, like literal grown men having a bitch fit. I've seen multiple guys quit for better opportunities. I've seen the cancerous idiot who will remain nameless but is kept on because of tenor or being decent at keeping machinery running. I've been close to the room while people bullshit for hours on end and talk shit about everybody and anyone who isn't in that direct room. \n\nThey \"give\" money away like a non profit however if you are smart enough to really follow the money most of that is going to lobbying politicians. They aren't really even helping the community anywhere around where they are based out of. I've seen all the money they take from hard working people that they are employing. They then turn around and give it away to make good on taxes so they don't have to pay as much. \n\n I'm going to tell you the good stuff now just in case you NEED a job, I wouldn't take it but the good things are the work is steady, you learn a lot and figure out a lot about yourself. There is always something to do. You will learn to work well with a lot of different types of people. You will learn how to set up and signal a crane and a construction sight. Signal and run all sorts of construction machinery.\n\n I will say one thing that irritated me more than anything, even more than the 2 days of PTO I was shelled out after being there 15 months. Is that its a culture that rewards the wrong people. Its a place where the problematic, mean, and combative people can continue to work there. Its a place where the guys who stand around in the dispatch office and shoot the breeze can be allowed to do that for hours, I'm not joking hours a week, and not get any repercussions whatsoever. If you want to make your way in a 'Christian\" Company go to chick fil a, Fuck this place, I'll never work there or anywhere like it again ",

I presented a CE course at UPR dental school, and they're faculty there, both of them with doctorates in education.\n\nFor some history, there used to be a hygiene program in PR until the 70's, but it was phased out for multiple reasons, primarily that the market couldn't sustain hygienists with higher salary due to minimal reimbursement rates.\n\nAssistants in PR can become EFDA's who can do prophies, but no perio, similar to the recent assistant expansions here on the mainland. Perio cases are usually referred to periodontists here. The difference is, these assistants still have to go to school for two years and get certified. This program is taught by one of the hygienists at the dental school.\n\nHygiene is still legal as a profession, there's just training for it anymore. Also, you could only expect about $14 an hour working as a hygienist here. That's a survivable wage on the island, the average wage is $8 an hour, but you'd essentially be stuck. Dentists here only make about 70-90k/year here themselves. Gentrification by mainlanders is rapidly making life incredibly difficult for Puerto Ricans though, but that's another story.\n\nAnyway, just thought some of you might find the state of hygiene in paradise interesting. :)",

I had always thought about being one, and I saw an opportunity so I applied. Passed an entry test (forgive me I don’t know the name), and I got an interview. Did one interview, and for I’d say the next three months, it was radio silence. \n\nI wasn’t disappointed. I wasn’t sad or anything. I just kinda moved on, and then after those months of silence, I got a follow up about a second interview. Went and did that, then got the polygraph out of the way. Had my final interview with the chief of police and he liked me and recommended they hire me.\n\nI’m only 20 years old, and I’ve been unemployed ever since I was laid off due to seasonal work. I’ll be honest with everyone here, I thought I’d be happier getting this offer. I thought it’d make me feel good, that I’d finally be starting life with a promising career I guess. The annual salary is great with the benefits I’d get as a 20 year old, nothing seems to be wrong with my offer. But, if I’m going to be even more honest with everyone, I just don’t feel good about it. I feel the complete opposite. \n\nI’m nervous I’m not the person to be doing this kind of job, I’m not necessarily afraid to fail but I’m for some reason anxious about all of this. Not in a typical anxious change way, but in a dreadful kind of way. I don’t know why I feel like that, I mean, I know so many people who’d kill to actually get an offer like the one I have. I just don’t know why I don’t feel good about it. \n\nI haven’t accepted the offer yet, I can choose to not go through with this or go in the following week to get my signature on the paperwork.

      "title": "Should I become a high school teacher?",
      "text": "I’m 23 with a bachelors in Economics (3.1 GPA) and have a corporate sales/analyst job making under 6 figures. I am looking at my future options, and the corporate ones in my field either require a graduate degree or significant progress climbing the corporate ladder, which seems harder and harder as time goes on but does have higher salary upside.\n\nMy main reasoning for looking into high school teaching is twofold. The first is that I enjoy working with people who are facing a problem, especially if they are reluctant to learn from me or are stuck in their ways in general. I’ve worked with children and young adults in a tutoring capacity that isn’t directly relatable to teaching of course, but my interest in teaching is certainly there and so is my level of patience, and not to mention I am more than okay, closer to impressed with high school teacher salary.\n\nThe second is that high school teaching seems to be a somewhat reliable way for me to invest in myself through graduate degrees. The school systems near me (NJ) all have, after your first year of teaching, a $50,000 / year tuition reimbursement system. To me, this seems like a more reliable (but not easy) way for me to earn my graduate degrees with 1-2 classes each semester during the school year and more during the summers, though I don’t know how “free” these summers actually are for teachers, as much as most people like to hype them up.\n\nThis will help me earn a masters and PhD (hopefully) within 10-15 years which I will use to either become a college professor (a dream job of mine, though I understand how hard it is to actually get that job) or work in a corporate/federal setting in my field (economics) in a consulting or an analyst related role.\n\n\nTL;DR:\n\nI am a 23 year old male with a bachelors in economics with a 3.1 GPA. \n\nI am looking at high school teaching as more of a work-study type program where I can get my grad degrees while working and receive tuition reimbursement, while earning a wage I could be content with.\n\nI see this as a 10-15 year plan as I get my masters and PhD in either Economics or Statistics. I do not see this directly as my long term career, but more of a 10-15 year job to begin my career and progress towards either becoming a college professor or a better corporate position as either a consultant or analyst. From there, it would also be nice to have teaching as a fallback option once I’ve already put 10-15 years into the stepwise teacher salary schedule.\n\n\nMain questions I’d like answered if possible:\n\nWhat are you main stressors in high school level teaching?\n\nAre the summers really “time off”? I understand some need a part time job, but assume for this case that I will not. Will I have enough time to get my graduate degrees?\n\nIs the tuition reimbursement all it’s chalked up to be? Or is there a catch?\n\nAnd finally, if you were in my shoes, would you take the risk and stick it out with corporate and maybe get an MBA down the line to advance your career, or would you work more directly toward graduate degrees while working in a high school teaching setting, assuming that’s even possible?\n\n\nThank you very much for reading this far or even at all, I truly appreciate any and all help with this decision.\n\n\n",

I had to drop out of college, partly due to family issues and partly because I didn’t want to waste two more years chasing a useless degree.\n\nI’ve always been an idealistic person, and since childhood I’ve had a strong passion for the culinary arts. That’s why I decided to invest in myself and enrolled in a private culinary arts school, paying around $9,000. The program lasts 8 months. 4 months of classes and 4 months of mandatory internship at a 5-star hotel in Istanbul.\n\nThe first week was just orientation, but the instructors kept emphasizing how brutal this industry is. Long hours, extreme pressure, and a harsh hierarchy. The more I researched and listened, the more I started questioning if simply loving to cook is enough to survive in this line of work.\n\nI’ve been struggling with ulcerative colitis for 6 years and major depression for even longer. The idea of working in such an intense, high-stress environment terrifies me. I already regret stepping into this path. On top of that, I found out the salaries are extremely low not even enough to barely survive.\n\nSo yeah… I feel lost. Completely lost.\n",

Big retailer.\n\nCurrently i make 120.5k. Small niche fintech.\n\n3 years of experience i perform as a DS but did a pretty good job in my current role and i do genuinely innovate. So i am also on track to be manager in my current role.\n\nType of work:\nRetailer is a lot of causal inference. I have to manage 4 people eventually 6.

My big boss is super generous so it’s not out of the table to get great salaries. Unprompted i got an offer from 102500 total to 120.5. So i am 100%.\n\nEnvironment:\nBig retailer: 4 days in office\nFintech: 2-3 days in offie probably 3  by next years.\n\nPeople:\nBig retailer: dont know but i go back to corporate.\nFintech: we do have a bunch of idiots in the company and execs are not really my favorite. I do like some of our senior leadership but the top exec other than 1 exec i dont really like them.\n\n\nCareer outlook: i came from original bank i had more interviews with big tech in the big bank than i did with fintech. Most of my interviews came from the fact i work in a big bank. So maybe going to big tech might be the play.\n\nI am gunning for the big tech roles so i am pushing as much as possible to hit the 180-200k comps so i can then climb the ladder.\n\nDo note for retailer I rejected their senior ds offer as it matched my comp. So they went in with manager and then svps sought me out. I interviewed and left a strong impression of how I explain + scope things as I do end to end ownership on my fintech role.\n\n\nCareer insight is appreciated.\n\n\n",

I also do not want to be stuck working in a lab for $20 an hour as a lab tech.\n\nI find myself more and more looking into 2 year graduate programs that are in the medical field that won't cost another $50-100k.

Cost-wise, it seems most degrees cost 10-25k, and the median salary starts at \\~60k and levels out to 80k (at least in WA state where I want to live).

Roughly 4 months in working full time I'm having second thoughts about this whole management thing. I'm struggling with some aspects of the job and I don't know how much of it I can attribute to just being new to the job. \n\nI'm going to be honest since I'm on a burner but I just feel retarded all the time and I don't think that anyone should count on me. I suck at time management and I feel like every task requires 5 mini tasks that each take time. I don't get much done every day as I overthink everything. I still want to do a good job so I stay late to do the things that I have to get done to a standard that is acceptable. And the thing that fucks me up is that I'm on salary so I get no overtime.\n\nI have no complaints about my project team, they're all actually great and so is my direct supervisor. But I'm tasked with a challenging scope (building envelope) that I actually am just assisting someone else with. In my daily work, I have interactions with my team, subcontractors, architects, owners rep etc where they ask questions and I can't answer anything satisfactorily. Almost every time my answer is \"I am not sure at this time but I can check for you\" because I can't retain information about the scope of work, the meeting we had, or constraints from last week.\n\nI wanna give myself time to at least try, and so I can say that I didn't give up, but I feel pretty stupid all the time at work and I don't like not being paid for staying late. If this doesn't work out I would join the carpenters union.  A new apprentice makes the same as I do now and doesn't have to worry about work when they clock out (unless I'm wrong, and I know about the physicality of the work and dealing with aches/pains).\n\n  \nSo, project managers and carpenters, chime in with your opinion, words of advice, or just tell me to suck it up and stay behind the computer.",

      "text": "Hi I was a middle school math teacher but I left and right now unemployed. I am just doing gig work like Amazon Flex, DoorDash, Lyft, and etc. I have been selling old things I don’t need just for extra cash. I have 4 years of teaching experience which means nothing at this point.\n\nBeing honest here, I haven’t put my degree in a frame. It still sits at the bottom of my night stand as a daily reminder of my mistake. \n\nI used to think that I could be that one teacher that could inspire children to dream big and never give up. I am a big anime nerd here so bare with me here. \n\nI wanted to believe I could be like Iruka sensei from Naruto or Koro sensei from Assassination Classroom. The reason I brought up these two teachers is because they shared my belief that if one person believes in you then that changes the trajectory of your life. \n\nIf you don’t understand the references, then let’s get true stories involved. Does anyone remember the movie Front of the Class? It tells the real story of how Brad Cohen, the teacher with Tourette’s syndrome became one of the best teachers that the students and staff loved and admired. \n\nFrom fiction to nonfiction, these teachers are what I aspired to be… the teacher I never had.\nI guess reality had to remind me that just because your passionate about Math not everyone will share that same enthusiasm. \n\nEspecially people who don’t seem to have a fundamental understanding of the basic four operations. \n\nWhen people decide to pursue teaching as a career, maybe someone should have added a disclaimer stating that in America you are 95% disciplining students and 5% teaching if any percent at all. Essentially teaching is baby sitting with a salary and you get the added benefit of administration and parents that don’t treat you as a human being.\n\nI have been to multiple job fairs for school districts and decided to be honest and transparent with the recruiter or principal that was there. It turns out that the saying “ The truth will set you free.” is wrong in the sense of job hunting. So I guess lying really well must be the way up the food chain and if you have a reference or two that speaks highly of you that can help. \n\nTeaching is treasured and honored in other countries. Just do a quick Google search and you will see what I mean. \n\nI guess what I’m trying to say here is that the United States culture of education is wrong and broken. Many people of old in the past have stated similar thoughts of the matter yet no one listened. \n\nThe funny thing about this is that if you were to Google search The Great Resignation, especially talking about education is this term anywhere else in the world?\n\nThe answer is NO.\n\nDo you know why that is the case? Couple of reasons emerge one reason is that the culture understands education doesn’t start from school it starts from home. The only thing school should be is a reinforcing ground for positive behaviors but now it is a festering ground full of negative and destructive behaviors. \n\nI understand why this is still happening. So I guess the best thing to do is be like the Lorax…Unless…\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "text": "I am a first year teacher who really needs some help. I teach in a private Christian school that is run by a pastor with no education background, he was previously a police officer. He is extremely political and is very outwardly unfriendly if someone chooses to not speak about their political opinions. I have a rule that I don't talk politics at work even if I agree with it, it just isn't something I like to do, and it bothers him that I won't speak on my opinions like the other teachers do. He often tells me I'm just too liberal. Just to reiterate... I have never once spoken on anything political with anyone I work with and I don't put anything political on my social media.\n\nThere have been five incidents this year in which he has come to me and said that \"the board\" is unhappy with me and that they don't believe I can/am do(ing) my job. After speaking with multiple members of the board I have discovered this has never once been brought up in discussion and that no-one would even agree with the sentiment. My students all improved this year in their state testing scores as well as their end of course exams; I am proud of them, and for sure know that he was never once correct in saying any of that to me. He went so far as to say that the board would be bringing in a new teacher for the final quarter to do a writing workshop with the kids because they weren't confident in me. This was also a lie, she is the teacher who will be taking over for me next year and since all of our students have 3 study halls daily (yes, literally 3 study halls every single day) she requested to come in and do anything with them to help get them through the day and to get to know them. He agreed to do this BUT only if he could completely remove my middle school students from my class and have them solely work with the new teacher. This was shot down by the principal as well as myself because we were in the middle of reading books together and it wasn't fair to just end the projects they were doing and give them zeros, which is what he requested that I do. So he agreed to allow them to do the writing workshop during one of their multiple study halls.\n\nWell now it's the end of the year and this new teacher has dozens of assignments that need to be graded and put into the grade book for students' transcripts. I have been informed that she will be grading them and that I would be responsible for putting the grades in under my name. I have completely refused as it is unethical for me to put those grades in as if I was the one who did them. I have never even seen the assignments. I also don't know if that's even legal to do. My grade book has already been closed and recorded for the past week. Is this something they can make me do? If I refuse to do it can he revoke the rest of my salary and not pay it out over the summer? How do I go about getting the borderline harassment from my boss to end? I still have a few months left in my contract.",

I’d be a counter chef making the hand rolls, talking to guests, and being part of the tip pool. Their flagship restaurant has a Michelin Guide Bib Gourmand award(!!), and this is ABSOLUTELY the style of food I dream of making. \n\nThe other option is a sous chef position at my local airport. I’d be working for HMSHost, which is a MASSIVE company, I’d be overseeing all the restaurants within the airport, I get my own office, a truly mind-blowing salary, and tons of other crazy benefits. Being with a company like that at the level they want me at would be an insane move for my career. The food, however, isn’t exactly Bib Gourmand-level and it doesn’t excite me the way option 1 does.\n\nChefs, what would you do if you were in my shoes?

Now, I am actively searching for employment in this field, yet I've encountered difficulties securing even a single interview, as employers seem to primarily seek MIG welders rather than SMAW welders. I feel compelled to express my opinion that these government-funded welding programs should either prioritize teaching MIG welding or extend the program's duration to encompass both welding techniques.

      "text": "I (18f Seattle, WA) have been wanting to become a 911 dispatcher for years, it has always been a job I've been interested in. Recently I spoke with my family about this and some people have just told me not to, some told me I may want to wait a few years till I actually consider this, which I understand and take into consideration, but this is really one of the only career choices that I have found myself interested in and passionate about.\n\nThroughout my research in this career, I've realized this will be a high stress job, and will take quite a mental toll on me. Which aren't things I am to worried about, I've had to deal with very high stress situations in the past and managed it very well.\n\nSome skills I have which I feel pertains to the job...  \n\\-I have fairly good communication skills, which also includes decent grammar.  \n\\-Time management skills (I've been told that it is a big-time commitment and is often unforgiving in that regard)  \n\\-I'm good under pressure and know how to control my emotions in stressful situations.  \n\\-Typing skills (65-80 wpm on average)\n\nAlso, I know that there is a background check, which I am slightly worried about. I had an incident a few years back; I was 15-16 I think. I was staying with sister for a few weeks and she didn't have food, nor the money to buy food, so my cousin and I stole food from a store. The cops came, (there were 2 sheriffs), we weren't detained, although, they did take our names and information, and we were trespassed from that store. And at one point when I was younger, I was self-admitted into the hospital for a mental evaluation (It wasn't an overnight stay, and if it's relevant, it was because I attempted to take my own life) but they deemed I was okay and that it was a onetime incident. I also didn't do well in school until 12th grade, so before then, I had hundreds of absents and pretty bad grades (That was because I had to care for family and was having issues with some people at my school, amongst various other factors). But in grade 12, I got very good grades, barely missed school, got 128 service hours (volunteer work), and even did some college courses. (I'm not sure if this matters, but I am currently going to college to study psychology and am also going to study communications)\n\nI'm wondering how likely is it for me to become a 911 dispatcher? I don't have any prior work experience I can put on my resume (I have done landscaping and small construction jobs 'off the books').\n\n**Questions I have**\n\n\\-Are there any courses I should take to prepare? Or things I should study?  \n\\-Are there any tips and suggestions you have for me?  \n\\-What are the hardest parts of the job?  \n\\-How do you stop yourself from burning out?  \n\\-On average, what does you work week look like/what is the schedule and hours?  \n\\-Do you struggle to separate work and personal life? What does that balance typically look like? How does this job effect your relationships (both platonic and not)?  \n\\-What are some things you wish you did differently in your career?  \n\\-Do you think the pay is enough for the work?  \n\\-What should I do to make myself a good candidate? (How should I present myself and prepare?)  \n\\-Should I wait a few years before applying? (If I do apply, it won't be until this coming summer, but I'm trying to prepare myself) And to add on to this, what is the youngest person you've worked with?  \n\\-What sort of mental toll does this job take on you?  \n\\-Are there many options to 'climb the ladder'?  \n\\-What is your average take home pay a month? What should I expect (salary wise) when just starting out?  \n\\-What are the best things about your job? What are the worst things about your job?  \n\\-What does the relationship between you and your coworkers look like?  \n\\-Do you have any advice for me?\n\nI know that is a lot of questions, but I really just want to know as much as I can before starting down this path and I'd really like to hear your insight, and if you perhaps have any questions for me, I am more than happy to answer.\n\nThank you for reading, any advice and help is welcomed.

My plan is to work full-time as a middle school science teacher during the weekdays while picking up weekend shifts (12 hours each on Saturday and Sunday) as a Registered Respiratory Therapist (RRT).\n\nWhy I’m Considering This:\n\nFinancially, it makes sense:\n\nTeacher salary in my area (Louisiana): ~$50K/year\n\nRT weekend shifts: $35/hour × 12 hours × 2 days × 52 weeks = $43,680/year\n\nTotal: ~$93,680/year\n\nI enjoy both teaching and healthcare and want to keep my options open. This might even be helpful if I want to do RT in academia.\n\nDo you think this is realistically sustainable?\n\nHas anyone here worked two professional jobs like this? How did it work out?\n\nWould I be better off just working full-time as an RT with extra shifts, or does having two jobs in different fields have long-term benefits?\n\nAny advice on managing burnout, time management, or making this setup work efficiently?\n\nI’d love to hear any insights from teachers, respiratory therapists, or anyone juggling multiple careers!

      "text": "I am trying to move up in my career and would love any perspectives, please. 28F, 7yrs experience in May, have my EIT, DC metro area, salary $111k (yr 4 GS12) \n\nAll my time has been federal construction management, first as AF civilian and now with GSA PBS. I hadn’t intended to do management over design but I ended up really enjoying it and in particular I like the mission, serving the taxpayer, and helping define requirements, vs grinding in private to compete for jobs. My roles have been project programmer, manager, contracting officer rep and sometimes multiple at once. I do scopes, negotiation, QA, doc management and invoicing, etc. At the AF I was involved in hurricane recovery and managed $100M of demo and temp facility projects. I moved to GSA mainly for geographical personal reasons, but I really like the variety of work and have had major construction (multiple $50M vertical construction) here too but not to that program scale plus smaller renovations and lease fit outs. \n\nI was planning to switch agencies in order to get my GS13 in the fall if unable to move up w GSA by then, but obviously, everything is crazy now. My RIF in the next four months is inevitable. I thought about going back to DOD, but it doesn’t feel guaranteed.\n\nI have an offer on the table with CDM smith to help replace lead pipe in DC. They really liked me and offered 24 hrs after my interview which was a huge confidence booster, and let me negotiate up the PTO to 20 days, it would be $130k and 3% 401k match. Hybrid schedule after a few months. I have to tell them an answer tomorrow. \n\nI had a final round 3 interview today with a non profit hospital system for new major construction. I was really optimistic they would tell me today or tomorrow if I would move forward because they seemed like they wanted people on site soon and had already asked for my references, and that they would match my other offer and it would be 24 days pto and 5% match. But the VP I talked today seemed less optimistic. He wanted someone with more healthcare experience and was planning to make decisions by end of April, and said he really liked my resume but also had some confusing questions on it, and then ALSO told me he wouldn’t give me false hope but to also call/email or “even text” him if my other offer didn’t work out so that we could discuss further. \n\nI like the nonprofit mission and company a lot more, but I feel stressed by these mixed signals and don’t feel like I have time to see how things pan out if I lose both opportunities, so I am leaning towards the first. I like that it’s a national company also. \n\nThe only thing I am quite stressed about is if this is a step “down”, going from building renovations and new builds to a utility infrastructure transformation program. It seems like a major undertaking all together and one I think is important, but is it too simple? Am I going to look like my resume has gotten consistently easier over time? Leading projects to part of a team? \n\nShould I ride out my time at GSA and keep looking? I had a couple other interested people but they said the projects would be for bids down the line. \n\nThanks in advance. ",

I applied back in 2022, and made it through every step of the interview process, including the family interviews and Chiefs interview, and fell out at the final step which is the psych evaluation. I was super bummed about that, partially because I felt like the evaluator judged me by my application alone and didn't explore it at all with me. \nI have been in recovery from drugs (11 years) and alcohol (4 years now) and was very very honest on my application about all of this and still made it super far in the interview process. Everyone seemed to appreciate my honesty, but I'm not sure it was the best idea since I feel like it ultimately cost me the job. \n\nAnyway, the agency requires you to wait three years before applying again, and I noticed a position just became available so was considering applying. I have a very stable government job right now but it is incredibly boring, and I have always been drawn to the dispatching field. I would potentially be taking a $20,000 pay cut, at least initially and based on the base salary of the position in my area. I do not have children, but do have a very needy dog, so schedule flexibility is not an issue for me. \n\nI guess I am wondering if anyone has hit a similar roadblock (psych eval) in the past and has any advice or suggestions if I go through it again? Since I've already applied with the agency, I will have to disclose it all again as I don't want to lie. And is OT such a widely expected scenario that the pay cut would make sense? I know it depends on the area so folks cant guarantee it would be worth it. If you were in my position, would you make the switch, or have you? \n\nSorry if these are dumb questions and pardon my rant. Appreciate any advice! ",

I took the Criticall 3 weeks go, had a general interview, and then a preemployment interview with all of the background things (it lasted 2 hours and I have a clean record!). I know have a 40 page background check packet that reaches everything from addresses to money to previous jobs, so on and so on. \n\nThis packet wants specifics. Examples- Ex coworkers names, starting salaries of old jobs, birthdays of the family members of my boyfriend I was living with a few years ago, exact dates of elementary/middle/high school, extensive credit reports, part time jobs that I had 10+ years ago in high school, etc. I haven’t gotten a conditional offer of sorts (no idea what the benefits/pay is, probably should have asked that in the first interview but I forgot) and I have this to go through, polygraph, psych evaluation, they’re interviewing the neighbors on my street and my family members with a background check on my boyfriend. I feel defeated by this process because it’s a lot and a lot on the background check form I have I can’t answer because I don’t remember or can’t find answers to (HRs to companies aren’t calling back, my high school clerks aren’t in everyday so it’s phone tag, etc). \n\nIs this a process that all centers go through? Again, I see the reason and I’m not upset over it, but I’m curious if I apply to something closer to home if it will be the same intensity or something different. ",

I am being given an internal opportunity to do something different in the company.\n\n**Pay:** Associate Level starts in the upper **$60,000s**, full \"Model Makers\" are in the mid to upper **70,000s**. I am leaving the position at $84k a year. I started 6 years ago as a full \"Model Maker\" making $64k.\n\nOvertime exists but it isn't consistent. \n\n**Benefits:** 5% 401K Match, 3% 401K Profit Sharing. Top notch Health Insurance (I pay around $105 a paycheck for a $350 deductible Cadillac Health Plan that covers my $6,000 a month Arthritis Meds 100%), a generous PTO Package (15 days to start, normal holidays off) plus the option to purchase 5 additional days of Optional Time Off over the course of the year. You are also allotted 5 Sick Days per year. PTO can be taken whenever you like. I have had days where I got to the parking lot, texted my boss and took a PTO day. It is written company policy that PTO is your time and you can take it whenever you like.\n\nTuition Reimbursement and Relocation Reimbursement are available as well.\n\nYearly Bonuses have been in effect for the 6 years I have been here, even during COVID. They are issued company wide for either a hard cash amount or 3% of your salary, whichever is higher. Yearly Cost of Living Adjustments have been close to the rate of inflation or just beating it.\n\n**Work Hours:** Shifts are either 7-3:30 for first shift or 2:30P-12A 4 10s for Second. Management is flexible with work times as long as you are producing good quality parts. They have no problem if you decide to work 6:30-3, for example. If you have a Drs Appointment, you can leave early and make up the time later in the week, or take PTO if it is more than 4 hours. Your workday includes 2 15 minute breaks and a 45 minute lunch. We have 2 Onsite Cafeterias that offer reasonably priced chow options.\n\n**Work Environment:** We have Prototrak Lathes, Prototrak Bed Mills, Prototrak K3 Knee Mills, 2 Haas VMCs and a Mazak VMC. This position is very much designed for the \"Jack of All Trades\" kind of worker. You would be expected to be able to learn the Prototrak conversational control and Mastercam for the other machines. Despite having a Mazak, we do no Mazatrol because we are a Mastercam Shop.\n\nThis is a pretty laid back environment where we are trusted to get our work done. I have always likened it to being an \"Independent Contractor\" in the shop. Jobs are doled out by our Tech Lead and we are expected to be able to get the work done independently. The other workers I work with are all pretty chill and are more than willing to help out with a problem or to bounce ideas off of. \n\n**There are no \"Crabs in a Bucket\" in this shop.**\n\n**Expectations:** We are looking for someone that has serious problem solving skills. You would be working directly with our engineering team to develop new products and prototypes as well as the fixturing and workholding the make what they need. A portion of our work is modifying castings before they can be tested, so having a good spatial understanding of non-flat parts is a big plus. \n\nMasterCam experience is a big plus, we are currently running 2024 and we update every 2 years once a stable version is released. Trainings are available, both in person and online with the end goal of becoming a MasterCam Certified Programmer.\n\nWe have a nascent 5S and Lean Manufacturing system in place, so that means the shop is fairly well organized with most tool boxes being Kaizened and all of our machines are kept clean and in well working order. The expectation is that the system will be expanded to include Total Productive Maintenance in the coming years.\n\nWhat we are NOT looking for: Bad Attitudes. We want people that work well with others, both in the Machine Shop day to day as well as Engineering, Design and Management.\n\nNo shop is perfect, but this is one of the better companies I have worked for in the 15+ years I have been slinging chips. The benefits are top notch, the work environment is pretty good and the crew in the machine shop is one of the best I have ever worked with in my entire career.",

      "text": "Hello everyone, new to the sub, and new to the industry.\n\nI'm currently doing my OTR training for Werner, I lucked out and got a pretty cool trainer doing the Dollar General route around Texas/OK/Arkansas.\n\nOnce I'm done training I'll be starting the Dollar Tree Western Flex account. I'll be getting hourly pay, CPM, and a modest trailer unload rate. These all combined, they told me my weekly pay would be about 1500 pre-tax, for a yearly salary of about 77k (pre-tax).\n\nNow I'm not naive enough to believe them and understand that it will likely be in 68k range as that's the scale they advertised for the job when I took it (68-77k).\n\nMy question is, after doing a lot of reddit searching, I'm seeing tons of people talking about \"fuck trucking they lie and you'll really be making 700-800 a week\" and it's got me a little nervous. This is a major lifestyle change and if that's the \"actual pay\" then I'm not sure how sustainable this will be. I've got a kid to take care of. So is that really what I can expect on the Dollar Tree account, western flex? 800 a week? I'm getting 750 a week just for training so it's hard to believe that I'd only be making $50 more per week once the real work starts.",

So now asking more people lol\n\nIf you’re wondering why I went to college instead of a trade right after high school, I went to community college for free and felt like continuing and getting a bachelors degree since I wouldn’t be paying for full four years was a good idea. \n\nIf I get an offer from a company I’m interviewing with I think I’ll be taking it.

      "text": "Hi all, so backstory here is important for context I think. I am considering a career change/addition into plumbing. I am 31F, currently own a nail salon with employees and realizing that I don't think it will ever be lucrative enough to give me a decent salary and I have been literally suffering for the last 6 months with no end in sight. The salon is sustaining itself but I can't pay myself and there isn't much change in sight when we are coming up on yet another typically slow season. I need to be able to support myself and have something to fall back on in tough times as I don't have a any extra help from anyone.\n\nNow, the reason I am considering plumbing is - first, my whole family and partner are in the trades (none are plumbers though) and are encouraging me to do it and I'm genuinely interested in it. Plumbing specifically seems right for me because I am not squeamish when it comes to gross things (I look at feet all day) and before I purchased the salon, the former owners told me one of the reasons that they offered the salon to me first was because I fixed all of the plumbing problems that came up in the salon - clogged drains and toilets, and a leaky sink. I know those are super basic but the way pipes go together just seem to make sense to me and it felt so amazing to be able to make those simple fixes for everyone. In my profession now I basically consider my title to be \"troubleshooter\" and I'm very detail oriented. I'm also just a person that can't stand to wonder \"what if?\" so I like to try to take advantage of opportunities that present themselves...\n\nI was browsing a few days ago and found that my local union is opening up the apprentice application process in the next couple weeks which seems a bit timely? But I have no idea how it works as the people in my life in the trades never went through this type of apprenticeship.\n\nI just want to hear from others that have gone through an apprenticeship, especially with a union and/or women in the trade.\n\n\\- I would need to transition from my current role, Does anyone know how long the application process takes? Does it vary?\n\n\\- Are apprenticeship schedules flexible in any way? \n\n\\- What daily schedule (shifts) do apprentices expect to have? Days per week? I understand that most people want to get it done as fast as possible and put in as many hours as they can but, is it at all possible to do it part time at the beginning? or would I have to prepare my salon for my full absence? \n\n\\- Has anyone else had another job while doing an apprenticeship?\n\n\\- Is this completely ridiculous for me to consider? I do assume journeymen may look at it as a waste of time to train someone part-time, even though that would be temporary and I truly would be dedicated. I just also have this other obligation at the moment. \n\nI'm planning on finding these things out when I go to apply soon but I'm just trying to figure out ahead of time if this could ever work logistically.\n\nAny and all additional info/advice is welcome.

      "text": "First off, thank you for clicking on my post—and for everything you do!\n\nA little background about me: I’m a 28-year-old active duty USAF firefighter, currently serving. I’ve been in for 9 years and have just over a year left. My highest cert is Fire Officer I, and I’ve held that role for about 4 years.\n\nAs most of us in the DoD know, the Air Force is considered the premier branch for firefighting (especially ARFF, which i hate). I love this job. I’ve learned so much and still have the passion to keep going. My only real concern is... experience.\n\nI’d say I’ve been lucky with the calls I’ve been on and the places I’ve served: Mississippi, Honduras, Syria, Kuwait, Korea, Guam, Qatar, Germany. I’ve made a ton of connections—so many that I know I’ll have plenty of opportunities once I’m out of the Air Force.\n\nThat said, the experience we get in DoD firefighting is a FRACTION^2  from what city departments deal with. We’re certified, but I wouldn’t say we’re as qualified. Honestly, it bothers me sometimes to be praised as a firefighter when I know I haven’t faced the same intensity that city guys do.\n\nRight now, I’m standing at a three-way crossroads:\n\nGo city\nGo GS (federal civilian)\nGo contract $$$\n\nYou’d think from the novel above, I’d know which path to take. But I don’t. I’m not afraid of starting from the bottom. Physically, I’m solid—I can handle an academy. Financially, I’ve been disciplined for years, and with whatever disability I get, I can afford to take a lower entry salary if needed.\n\nThe only advice I hear from my peers is “go GS” or “go contract.” No one I know has much perspective on transitioning from DoD firefighting to the civilian side. To some, it seems like a downgrade. I get why—but at the end of the day, I think it just depends on what matters most to you.\n\nI don’t feel fulfilled in the Air Force anymore. It’s been a great run, and I still show up every day and give it my all. But I’m ready for the next chapter. \n\nAny prior service firefighters out there with insight? I’d really appreciate any perspective on this transition.\n\n",

I have experience machining plastics, aluminium, mild steels, 303 stainless and D2 tool steel and I regularly  work in tolerances down to 0.025mm \n\nI have experience in machining large parts up to 1000mm * 500mm and as small as 10mm * 10mm. \n\nDue to a lot of people leaving I'm one of 3 fully trained full time machinists. I'm therefore responsible for ensuring my machines are maintained weekly, filters are cleaned, coolant concentration and pH is correct, oil is topped up and that the machine is safe to use. \n\nI would like to say that I kick out parts at a reasonable rate. I work in a place where everything needs to be done yesterday and I usually never get complaints about my speed. \n\nOn top of that I have some specialised knowledge on other machines, I was fully trained on a gundrilling machine by sombody who left, so after I've spent nearly a year using it full time I have the most knowledge in the shop on how to use the machine. \n\nIn the last year I've also been training apprentices which has definitely improved my leadership skills and my ability to manage other people. \n\nLastly, I work in shifts and I regularly do overtime when asked. I work upwards of 50 hours a week sometimes and when at work I like to think I'm working as quickly and as efficiently as I can. For example I take my lunch only when both machines are running and I program parts or write macro programs in my free time instead of sitting on my phone. \n\nI'm pretty young in comparison to everybody else at the shop which is why I think im being underpaid. People in management who don't see me work often assume I'm incompetent or slow in comparison to other people, which makes me really sad because I've worked extremely hard to try and prove myself only for them to make sweeping assumptions. \n\nI'm currently making less than £14 an hour or 28k a year without overtime. Is this standard for this field of work? Can I expect much more concidering my experience and my age? \n\nIn the past I've been given payrises because of my performance however my skills have significantly increased in the past year and I've had nothing. When I ask for a payrise I just want to know what I should expect.  \n\nRemember, I'm in the UK, so our ecomony is very different when compared to the US or Canada. Some of you guys in America are making $100k a year but over here that's pretty rare. \n\nThe average UK salary is £37k a year for full time employees.\n\n",

      "title": "Am I being unrealistic here?",
      "text": "I am still reeling from one of the most toxic business relationships I’ve ever experienced with a brokerage and trying to figure out what the hell just happened.\n\nI was originally hired on in a “leadership position” to help create a unique RE tech product and craft a lead program.  I was told I would be strategy, and be earning salary + a down line from others brought on after me who would be commission only and focused on recruiting.\n\nAfter some time it became apparent the broker who brought me on has no idea how any of the tech actually works in the backend and wanted me to somehow wave my hands to create a platform from other pieces of RE tech he had previously picked out prior to hiring me.\n\nThe communication was inherently terrible from the beginning but became worse over time.  The broker would dictate messages only so the thoughts were incomplete word salad that I eventually trained an LLM to translate for me.  To give you an idea, he would send an email with the entire message in the subject line. 🤦🏻‍♀️\n\nAbout two months in, he told me we should be hiring a minimum of 72 agents a year each.  With no real reasoning I got told that recruiting was always the focus (I have the receipts to prove that I was not hallucinating my original job title and focus).  Anytime I pushed back he would just yell that it was always the case and we must have not been paying attention.  He went so far as to ream me out during one of our last public meetings so badly I nearly quit on the spot.\n\nWhen asked what our selling points were he would say “it’s personal personal personal, luxury luxury luxury - same thing I’ve been saying over and over”.  The recruiters bringing on agents also become their “business strategist” and are meant to be their to coach, plan, provide technical help, etc (hence why he thinks “personal” is an effective recruiting strategy).\n\nHe is expecting a 1099 employee to recruit the agent, hire them on and THEN be paid $500/mo. for as long as they are with the company.  I believe the recruiter/strategist is also meant to get a small fee when they close but because the messaging is so chaotic it was never clear what that amount really was.  To be clear, you are meant to provide all the support to that agent aside from broker related questions and TC work.  I am not a recruiter - I was not hired to be.  But all the sudden I found myself forced to be one, and I had no idea how hard that would actually be.  \n\nDo you think anyone would sign on to be a full time recruiter + business strategist for $500/month per agent + small commission fee upon each closing?  He calls it ‘generous’ but I’m struggling to see it that way.  Am I crazy here?",

Young apprentices or old Journeymen any and all are welcome to share what they think. Was it worth it? If you could go back would you do anything differently?

I interviewed for a dispatcher position for the second-largest county in my state, which would be a significant career change if I am offered a position and accept the offer. Although, during the 2 hour sit along, it reminded me a lot of my answering service years as we dealt with emergent medical calls that we had to relay and had scripts to follow. We did not receive any \"real\" emergency calls, though. Alarm call, fire on the concrete floor, caller fell asleep at the wheel going about 25 mph and hit a guard rail, etc. \n\nSome cons of my current job are no raises this year, very limited opportunities for advancement, and pay that is not enough to support my family's independence due to medical bills just before COVID and now we just can't get ahead enough to afford monthly expenses once we move out (my husband is disabled so his low income is fixed). I'm salaried, so no OT pay despite working extra hours often. No union.\n\nHowever, a significant advantage of my current role is being able to create my schedule 90% of the time, which is a big deal for me as a parent. I stilk work nights and weekends. As I previously mentioned, I do enjoy my job. I have the opportunity to literally change someone's life with a simple job offer. It's just a job for most, but I've hired 16 &amp; 17 yr old baggers who are now department managers at 19/20. A cashier who is now an assistant store manager and a dairy clerk who is now in our asset protection program. I don't work on Thanksgiving or Christmas day , but I do work most other holidays. \n\nSo, my question is, if offered the dispatcher position, would you think it's worth changing careers?

I have some stuff I was wondering if you’ve A) ever been in the role or B) hired someone for this role. \n\nThe structure is majority setting up the legal documents/contracts and coordinating new build stages with buyers. Some trickling in of market analysis and potentially house showings/open houses. \n\nOverall it feels like he just needs a second-in-command to help run his business which I get as I’ve been in project management for a few years now. \n\nMy questions are, is it normal to get a % bonus with each deal closed? (Not % of the transaction, but rather a % of my salary pay). If so what would I actually expect if they say they close around half a dozen homes a month? \n\nMy second question is, is it normal for me to have to do showings/open houses? I’m very familiar and comfortable with the operational and coordination side to it, however I’m not exactly an extroverted “realtor” type (I am easy to get along with and most of my coworkers always like to hang out with me after work FWIW) but I just feel slightly uncomfortable I might not be a good fit in that area, although he did say it was minimal, it’d still be there. \n\n\nAppreciate the insight.

      "text": "**Hi everyone,**\n\nI'm planning to start my journey as an electrician this spring and have a few questions.\n\nI've done some research (GPT, Reddit, YouTube), and here’s what I found:\n\n1. **Best places in LA to train:**\n   * IBEW Local 11 &amp; LA Electrical Training Institute (LAETT)\n   * WECA (Western Electrical Contractors Association)\n2. **Best programs (for me):**\n   * Commercial Electrician (at WECA)\n   * Inside Wireman (at IBEW Local 11) *(I believe this is essentially the same as Commercial Electrician)*\n\nI'm considering these programs because they seem to offer the best balance between salary, work conditions, and job opportunities. Other options like residential, low voltage, and lineman apprenticeships seem less balanced in my opinion, even though they are shorter.\n\nI have a bachelor's and master's degree in Electrical Engineering, but I earned them abroad, so I assume they won’t make much difference in my electrician career here in the U.S. Also, as a foreigner, I’m unfamiliar with the whole **union vs. non-union** debate and which is better.\n\nI haven’t had the chance to consult with a real person yet, so I’d really appreciate your insights on:\n\n* Which institution and program you’d recommend\n* Pros and cons of each\n* Any advice you might have\n\nThanks in advance!",

      "text": "TL;DR roast me into reality, starting an electrical contracting business is way out of the realm for me, long days/weeks doesn’t scare me away but not having touched the work and being so far removed and a potential lack of income + start-ups costs does. \n\nI’ve been in the trade since 2011. Bounced around early on but majority of early career/apprenticeship was spent working for a mechanical contractor, close to a decade, few years of solar installs, few years of HVAC Controls, sprinkled in with random electrical work as required (RTU swap outs, small commercial roughs/fit-outs, etc), I left for a year to work for a smaller elec outfit but wound up back as it was a really good company hence the almost decade of employment. \n\nThey eventually offered me a role as commercial PM/Estimator for mechanical work. I was reluctant as I had recently been licensed and was planning on leaving for an elec firm to keep growing/expanding, but it seemed like a good opportunity with good growth potential, stuck with it for a few years then left for a large commercial electrical contractor in a PM role, this was a money move more than anything, wasn’t a fan of the office life and was hoping getting back into electrical would change that, it didn’t, same BS. This is where I really started flirting with getting my contractor license and going on my own, ordered some study materials, booked the test, grabbed a domain name, close to filing an LLC., my hesitation was that now I have a family that relies on my income and the initial start-up costs and having to go for it while I haven’t had the tools on or been chasing side work, quitting the safety net of a regular paycheck, too much risk I felt for the stage of life I’m in. So while I was checking the boxes and queuing up this potential shift I did a quick indeed search and a local CM/GC that I was familiar with, was great to deal with, was hiring and since the office side seemed to be all the same BS I figured why not and threw my hat in the ring to see what would happen, well they bit, I threw out what I felt was a high salary and they accepted. It’s been 2 years now, and it’s so much worse, I don’t even feel like I’m building anything anymore, dealing with varying degrees of architects and owners reps, non stop meetings with follow up, chasing deadlines and dates, sub par sub contractors, not being able to be as efficient as I would like to be in everything I touch because of the amount of things requiring management.\n\nAll of this, and recently renewing my license and taking me CEU has me dreaming of trying to go on my own again but realistically I know it isn’t feasible, again, I haven’t had my tools on it 5 maybe 6 years, have barely grazed the code book in the same amount of time, and have zero clients/side work to gain any traction with and no time to try to build that up.\n\n**end rant**",

I’ve always been interested in the trades, particularly plumbing and I’m also pretty mechanically inclined. I’ve done a whole lotta car work, including some fairly big jobs. \nAnyway, I know I’m going to take a pay cut initially and I’m aware I can check the pay scale to see what I can expect in that department, but I have questions about the Seattle apprenticeship. I’d like to know more about the daily schedule in terms of class and real world work, where most of the jobs are (I live in Tacoma and I know the training center is in Renton), the interview process, things like that.

      "title": "Questions on Plumbing School",
      "text": "Hello,\n\nI read the rules and didn't see anything about asking for school advice, but if it's an issue, I can delete this post. After years of attending community college at 26, I finally decided to pursue a trade, and I wish I had done this sooner, but I'm trying to better myself. What I'm here for is to ask questions about the plumbing field. So, I applied and got into a 9-month plumbing program at a trade school, and I was looking around to plan for my future, if I get to the point where I finish. Every time I look up information, I seem to get more confused than the last time. So my questions are:\n\nFYI I'm located in Illinois\n\nWith the trade school, I get a certificate and I can take that anywhere, but if I join the union instead of trade school, do I get a certificate that I can go anywhere with or is it only for that local?\n\nIf I finish trade school and go into the union, will I start at a higher percentage than those who didn't go into trade school? Say, instead of starting at 30%, will I start at 40% or 50%?\n\nWhile I attend school, should I apply for the union? I know it can take months to find out if you get in, but I fear that if I do, I will have to take more classes on top of going to trade school. Will that make the journeyman process faster, or will it benefit me in any way by going to school and taking classes for the union?  \n\nHow many years of apprenticeship do I actually have to do? I see 2-4, 4-5, just so many different years that I just don't know. \n\nSay, I finish school and get into the union, can I choose if I want to be a plumber or a pipefitter? Can I choose residential or commercial? I've worked in maintenance for about 5 years, and I like building new, but I enjoy fixing and seeing my work weeks, months, and years later, still working. \n\nMy last question... maybe. Say I go non-union, does the process work the same? \n\nThis is a lot and I apologize!  Every day I'm thinking of new questions, but I'm in that mindset of it's late for me and I should've finished school sooner, because I had goals and I'm either not going to reach them or wait longer to do so and it brings all these anxieties.

      "text": "I have been thinking about becoming a plumber, I noticed that in the state where I live in they make a lot of money for some reason? When ever I try to google how much a specific job gets paid I always get very inconsistent answers but in my area they make between 60-90+k a year which sounds like a lot for a trade profession that does not require a college degree. Heck when I called my local plumbing union which is 290 tech they told me a beginning plumbers apprentice with no experience makes about 23 dollars an hour. I went to college for like a year for a drafting certificate and my first job with that paid me about 18 dollars an hour. Also the guy I talked with on the phone at that plumbing union told me that training does not cost any money all I have to do apparently is \"pay my dues\" which sounds too good to be true tbh. Doing trade apprenticeships sounds so much better than going to college it kind of makes me wish that I didn't. But then I wondered how often do salaries for plumbers change over time? Google told me the average amount of money a journeyman plumber makes is about 43 dollars an hour which is a lot, but in other states plumbers get paid like between 40-50k a year. Why does my region which is the pacific north west gets paid so much compared to others which is fewer and can that radically change over time? Do salaries for trade professions change more radically than salaries for jobs that require a college degree? Also I am from Oregon.",

I have about 6 years of sales experience and I am a 25M and former college athlete. \n\nThe thing about being an ISA under her team is that I am in charge of lead generation, cold calling, and underwriting new commercial listings. \n\nShe sat me down yesterday and told me that I would be a hell of a sales agent. I’ve only been doing this job for less than 2 months but she insist that she will pay for me to go to real estate school and I can still keep my base salary job until I finish. She said the skills I am learning are already what it takes to have a great career. My current girlfriend is a real estate agent as well, mostly residential and she has been killing it the past 2 years. \n\nMy only worry is that I don’t know if I will have enough money to go 100% into commission only. I worked so hard to pay my cc debt this year and I don’t know if I will have the funds to get me through the first few months of a commission only job. \n\nI trust my mentor as she is an investor herself with over $10M worth of real estate and does about 40 transactions a year. I know with her guidance I won’t fail. Next year is going to be a good year for Muti Family listings as many sellers will enter the market. \n\nI’ve thought about liquidating my 401K and Roth IRA to get me over the hump of the first 6-12 months. Part of me is terrified to start all over from nothing, but another part of me is like “Burn the boats and you’ll see what you’re made of.” \n\nA lot to think about but would love to hear what you guys think I should do. I can start real estate school now while getting a salary, stack my money in my savings, and at the end of Q1 2026, go into full time as an agent. \n\nThoughts? ",

      "text": "I would like to preface this by saying that Im a union pipefitter, so I know a bit about piping and pumps, but I am on the construction side, not service. \n\nI currently live in an 4 year old 8 unit condo building with an HOA. Our existing booster pump is so loud that it had to be turned off. I could hear it in my unit on the top floor, and was driving the folks on the first floor nuts. WIth it being off it takes me over a minute to fill a 1 gallon watering can, which drives me nuts.\n\nIm reaching out to a few of the vendors I work with for solutions, but most of these guys work in much larger scale. The one quote I got back was for a Hyfab eMVPjr Simplex Booster Pump Package, which at $8k, will be a tough sell to the HOA, and is fairly large for the undersized room the booster has to sit in.\n\nI was looking at some of the Grudfos boosters with integral VFD which I thought could really help do the soft start, but I honestly have no experience in picking pumps myself as I work all plan and spec. \n\nI was hoping someone with more experience could help provide some insight. Im still reaching out to some other vendors hoping they can  help as well. ",

      "text": "During a routine service to my oil fired boiler (cleaning, filter change, combustion check, etc…) the tech noticed abnormal pressures and ended up placing the pressure relief valve on the boiler which had corroded shut.  After that he was still noticing excessive pressure and ended up isolating the indirect tank which then caused pressures to become normal.  The potable water (pressurized by my hydro pneumatic tank-I am on a well) was pressurizing the hydronic system via a hole in the heat exchanger.  \n\nLuckily I have plumbers/pipefitters in the family so replacing the tank is no big deal, but what should I do about the potable water infiltration into the hydronic system?  Flush it?  Check chemistry and just make sure pH and hardness are good?  I’ve been in the house eight years with zero issues.  The boiler (Buderus) and tank (Bradford White 46 gallon) were installed in 2004.  ",

      "title": "Work/Life Balance--How Flexible is Scheduling as a Journeyman or later?",
      "text": "Current ambition is a union apprenticeship (UA 60) but I had some questions for the community I don't want to ask at the union.\n\nNo issues with working 40/50+ hr weeks during the 5 years of apprenticeship while I'm learning, but I'm curious--as a Journeyman or in later stages of the career, once I have some training and experience under my belt, how viable or common is it to request with the company to work fewer hours or, alternately, to take off a couple months a year? I know a lot of folks work 4 10's, and that seems look a great set-up to me, but honestly I'm totally spoiled with my current schedule working \\~30 a week and I want to be able to comfort myself as I make the transition to trade work by dreaming that this may be possible again a few years ahead in the future. Is it feasible to request a shorter work week or a stretch of time off if I don't need the money of working full time all year? Does anybody do this? I'm sure this is all case-by-case to some extent, but do most folks need to be already in business for themselves before they can properly negotiate their hours or work on their own schedule? I'm sure there's no set standard for this, just asking for everyone's experience.\n\nI don't feel comfortable asking these questions at the union because I don't want to seem lazy or unambitious--but, to be honest, a lot of the appeal of trade work for me is to work hard to put myself in a position where I may be able to create my own schedule. Plumbing seems like it could be perfect for this because there is such a good market for the work, but I don't really have a good understanding of how everything works. At what level of experience would setting my own schedule change from a pipedream (ha) to something actually feasible? Would the pipefitter path or other trade paths make this more or less possible?\n\nThe more experience you get, the more your time is worth, so it seems like there's a natural incentive structure to stay busy the longer you've been in the field; I'm wondering, then: is it unheard of to cut back on hours into something more part time once establishing yourself in the career? Is this something that's only feasible if you're working for yourself, or can you establish yourself as a Journeyman and then market yourself to a company as someone who wants to have limits on their scheduling? Is this more possible at the Master Plumber level?\n\nMy gf works remotely and no kids in the plans, and honestly our habits and lifestyle are such that we spend very little money. I'd love to work hard at the profession and find myself in a position where I could arrange with a company to take a couple months off a year so we could travel, or, alternately, to have a flexible weekly schedule because I have a lot of interests and hustles that I would like to devote time to outside the work week. Does anybody do this sort of thing after their apprenticeship?",

      "text": "We are a growing HVAC crew that does a good amount of work with a local plumber.  He’s a one man in a van type company and we are his biggest (also only) clients.  He’s a great guy, personable, smart, does great work… everything you’d look for in a subcontractor.  \n\nHis costs are rising as are ours. Our plumbing division is only 4-5% of our total revenue but it’s steady and increasing.  Of this revenue, the plumber charges us nearly 60-65% to do the job and we cover equipment costs (2024).  We also directly employ his helper/apprentice. So our margins on plumbing are nearly zero with this set up.  Coupled with the fact he is always late on sending us invoices (by multiple months), and we already have plumbing as part of our umbrella insurance plan… it’s essentially a negative to keep him going. \n\n\nAt this point, we are getting to a crossroads. Dropping our plumbing altogether to protect our HVAC margins from this plumbing hole, or offer to buy out the plumber and have him become a full time employee. If we drop him, I’m sure he would be able to keep going and stay busy with other work.  I’d rather not drop him though given we like the guy.  \n\nEconomically, it makes more sense for both parties to merge.  That’s the outcome I would like to see. However, the plumber is very independent. It’s partly why he is a one man in a van. He likes setting his own schedule and living on his terms.  A merge wouldn’t need to change that.. I mean, that’s how he operates now and it’s not impacting how things are done. \n\nWe would take on all the admin duties, absorb any insurance he has to pay out, can offer him a better salary than what we pay him currently, cover his overhead… bringing him in the fold would then help protect our hvac margins a bit better. We could hire more people for him and it could be a good deal for everyone. \n\nI am just not sure how to approach the subject.  What are the bottlenecks or pinch points that could trip up this type of arrangement?  He is making out pretty nice already not taking on any equipment costs.  But he’s also a 1099 subcontractor, he has to do all his paperwork on his own. He has his own insurance and taxes and all that good stuff… the stuff he doesn’t really like or want to do.\n\n\nAny thoughts on how to entice the guy to selling out and just joining our crew full time?

I’m highly interested in becoming a commercial plumber.\n\nI’ve already applied and gone through the interview and math assessments with Local 142 Pipefitters &amp; Plumbers Hall, but unfortunately, I didn’t get accepted. Right now, I’m working in a Commercial fab shop company that the union referred me to.

      "title": "The “three tiers” of data engineering pay — and how to move up",
      "text": "**The “three tiers” of data engineering pay — and how to move up (shout out to the article by geergly orosz which i placed in the bottom)**\n\nI keep seeing folks compare salaries across wildly different companies and walk away confused. A useful mental model I’ve found is that comp clusters into *three tiers* based on company type, not just your years of experience or title. Sharing this to help people calibrate expectations and plan the next move.\n\n# The three tiers\n\n* **Tier 1 — “Engineering is a cost center.”** Think traditional companies, smaller startups, internal IT/BI, or teams where data is a support function. Pay is the most modest, equity/bonuses are limited, scope is narrower, and work is predictable (reports, ELT to a warehouse, a few Airflow dags, light stakeholder churn).\n* **Tier 2 — “Data is a growth lever.”** Funded startups/scaleups and product-centric companies. You’ll see modern stacks (cloud warehouses/lakehouses, dbt, orchestration, event pipelines), clearer paths to impact, and some equity/bonus. companies expect design thinking and hands-on depth. Faster pace, more ambiguity, bigger upside.\n* **Tier 3 — “Data is a moat.”** Big tech, trading/quant, high-scale platforms, and companies competing globally for talent. Total comp can be multiples of Tier 1. hiring process are rigorous (coding + system design + domain depth). Expectations are high: reliability SLAs, cost controls at scale, privacy/compliance, streaming/near-real-time systems, complex data contracts.\n\nNone of these are “better” by default. They’re just different trade-offs: stability vs. upside, predictability vs. scope, lower stress vs. higher growth.\n\n# Signals you’re looking at each tier\n\n* **Tier 1:** job reqs emphasize tools (“Airflow, SQL, Tableau”) over outcomes; little talk of SLAs, lineage, or contracts; analytics asks dominate; compensation is mainly base.\n* **Tier 2:** talks about metrics that move the business, experimentation, ownership of domains, real data quality/process governance; base + some bonus/equity; leveling exists but is fuzzy.\n* **Tier 3:** explicit levels/bands, RSUs or meaningful options, on-call for data infra, strong SRE practices, platform/mesh/contract language, cost/perf trade-offs are daily work.\n\n# If you want to climb a tier, focus on evidence of impact at scale\n\nThis is what consistently changes comp conversations:\n\n* **Design → not just build.** Bring written designs for one or two systems you led: ingestion → storage → transformation → serving. Show choices and trade-offs (batch vs streaming, files vs tables, CDC vs snapshots, cost vs latency).\n* **Reliability &amp; correctness.** Prove you’ve owned SLAs/SLOs, data tests, contracts, backfills, schema evolution, and incident reviews. Screenshots aren’t necessary—bullet the incident, root cause, blast radius, and the guardrail you added.\n* **Cost awareness.** Know your unit economics (e.g., cost per 1M events, per TB transformed, per dashboard refresh). If you’ve saved the company money, quantify it.\n* **Breadth across the stack.** A credible story across ingestion (Kafka/Kinesis/CDC), processing (Spark/Flink/dbt), orchestration (Airflow/Argo), storage (lakehouse/warehouse), and serving (feature store, semantic layer, APIs). You don’t need to be an expert in all—show you can choose appropriately.\n* **Observability.** Lineage, data quality checks, freshness alerts, SLIs tied to downstream consumers.\n* **Security &amp; compliance.** RBAC, PII handling, row/column-level security, audit trails. Even basic exposure here is a differentiator.\n\n# prep that actually moves the needle\n\n* **Coding:** you don’t need to win ICPC, but you *do* need to write clean Python/SQL under time pressure and reason about complexity.\n* **Data system design:** practice 45–60 min sessions. Design an events pipeline, CDC into a lakehouse, or a real-time metrics system. Cover partitioning, backfills, late data, idempotency, dedupe, compaction, schema evolution, and cost.\n* **Storytelling with numbers:** have 3–4 impact bullets with metrics: “Reduced warehouse spend 28% by switching X to partitioned Parquet + object pruning,” “Cut pipeline latency from 2h → 15m by moving Y to streaming with windowed joins,” etc.\n* **Negotiation prep:** know base/bonus/equity ranges for the level (bands differ by tier). Understand RSUs vs options, vesting, cliffs, refreshers, and how performance ties to bonus.\n\n# Common traps that keep people stuck\n\n* **Tool-first resumes.** Listing ten tools without outcomes reads Tier 1. Frame with “problem → action → measurable result.”\n* **Only dashboards.** Valuable, but hiring loops for higher tiers want ownership of data *as a product*.\n* **Ignoring reliability.** If you’ve never run an incident call for data, you’re missing a lever that Tier 2/3 value highly.\n* **No cost story.** At scale, cost is a feature. Even a small POC that trims spend is compelling signal.\n\n# Why this matters\n\nAverages hide the spread. Two data engineers with the same YOE can be multiple tiers apart in pay purely based on company type and scope. When you calibrate to tiers, expectations and strategy get clearer.\n\nIf you want a deeper read on the broader “three clusters” concept for software salaries, Gergely Orosz has a solid breakdown (“The Trimodal Nature of Software Engineering Salaries”). The framing maps neatly onto data engineering roles too. link in the bottom\n\nCurious to hear from this sub:\n\n* If you moved from Tier 1 → 2 or 2 → 3, what was the single project or proof point that unlocked it?\n* For folks hiring: what signals *actually* distinguish tiers in your loop?\n\narticle: [https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/software-engineering-salaries-in-the-netherlands-and-europe/)",
